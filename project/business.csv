Ircon shares surge nearly 14% on multiple orders & capex boost,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/ircon-shares-railway-stock-surge-rites-rvnl-titagarh-rail-systems/articleshow/121619817.cms,"Representative image

S hares of Ircon International Ltd soared nearly 14 percent on Wednesday following a flurry of new project wins and optimism around infrastructure-linked capital expenditure.At 2:47 pm, Ircon's stock was trading at Rs 220.97, up Rs 27.03 or 13.94 percent for the day. The intraday high touched Rs 221.03, marking a strong recovery amid broader market volatility. The rally comes after the company secured contracts worth over Rs 898 crore in May across railway, power, and industrial infrastructure.Among other railway-related stocks, RITES climbed 6.5 percent, Texmaco Rail & Engineering rose 8 percent, Titagarh Rail Systems gained 4 percent, while HBL Power Systems advanced more than 3 percent.Among the major deals, Ircon won an Rs 187 crore project from Kerala State IT Infrastructure Ltd to build a rural industrial park in Thiruvananthapuram. It also bagged an Rs 458.14 crore civil works contract from North Eastern Electric Power Corporation for the Tato-I Hydro Electric Project in Arunachal Pradesh, according to an ET report.In addition, the South Western Railway awarded Ircon an Rs 253.6 crore contract to implement the indigenous KAVACH train collision avoidance system across 778 route kilometres in Bengaluru and Mysuru divisions.These wins, aligned with the government’s infrastructure push, have improved investor sentiment despite recent earnings pressure.While Ircon reported a 3.8 percent year-on-year decline in Q4FY24 net profit to Rs 246.8 crore, and a sharp 56.3 percent fall in EBITDA, the new contracts and expected capex upcycle appear to have overshadowed near-term financial softness. Analysts have assigned a cautious outlook with an average target price of Rs 158, suggesting downside from current levels. However, the stock’s rise over the past three months, bolstered by today’s surge, indicates growing market confidence in its project execution capabilities and future growth prospects.","At 2:47 pm, Ircon's stock was trading at Rs 220.97, up Rs 27.03 or 13.94 percent for the day.

Gold Price Outlook

This week to remain volatile and set tone in terms of new direction in prices

Gold Price Weekly View: Highly Volatile (Duration 1 – 2 weeks)

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market and other asset classes given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)

Gold price prediction today: Gold prices ended the last week down and also continued to consolidate during the entire May month below record highs touched in April. Meanwhile, spikes seen in prices in recent sessions were only on account of geopolitical developments involving Russia & Ukraine as Ukraine carried out its biggest strike on record hitting almost $7bn worth of Russian military planes.The yellow metal jumped almost 2% yesterday while Silver prices were boosted by 5 % due to augmented safe haven flows.On the global trade front, US President Donald Trump lashed out at China over the weekend and accused the latter of violating a preliminary tariff agreement, reviving fears of a trade war between the world's two largest economies. Trump also announced to double tariffs on steel imports from 25 % to 50 % while reportedly urging countries to present the most favourable trade by Wednesday in an effort to speed up discussions before reciprocal tariffs come into effect on July 8. This also kept the dollar upside limited, keeping it below 100 since last week.Bullion prices remained also up following Federal Reserve (Fed) Governor Christopher Waller's slightly dovish approach, saying that rate cuts remain possible later this year.However, he warned that policymakers are mainly focused on controlling inflation.Overall bias for bullion still suggests limited upside for the current week as June tends to be the weakest season of the year for Gold Miners & stocks in terms of seasonal approach, leaving waning interest in markets. Meanwhile volatility could also remain high as US Fed members continue to stick to easing bias but rate cut probabilities stay delayed only after September month. Adding to these concerns, any further escalation in Russia Ukraine conflict, with any retaliatory response from Russia warrants caution for the USD bulls and may lead to volatility in bullion prices.Traders also look forward to the release of several macro cues including US JOLTS Job Openings along with speeches by influential FOMC members. The major focus, however, will remain on the US monthly employment details, or the Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) report due on Friday amid steady payrolls may confirm delayed rate cut for the year.Strategy: We expect limited upside in Gold for the coming week as any volatile spike towards $3420 - 3450 per oz in Spot (CMP $3358 per oz) remains a selling opportunity on a weekly basis. On MCX Aug futures (CMP Rs. 97,785 per 10 gm) prices could trade in a broad range of Rs. 99,850 – 93,980 per 10 gm for a duration of 10 – 15 trading days.MCX Silver is expected to remain steady as compared to Gold while may trade in a broad range of Rs, 98,700 – 1,03,500 per Kg. (CMP Rs. 1,00,630 per Kg.) in July futures contract.","Maneesh Sharma, AVP - Commodities & Currencies, Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers shares his views and recommendations.

They cited insufficient urgency and limited global vision as key issues.During a media roundtable on Wednesday, they observed that while India is experiencing an emergence of technically proficient, AI-focused founders, many maintain a cautious, risk-averse approach that could prove detrimental in this fast-moving sector. ""In the Valley, it's a warzone.

Kirani noted that US-based AI-first startups demonstrating revenue growth can achieve valuations over $500 million at $15 million ARR, while traditional SaaS firms with similar figures typically receive valuations around $100 million.""The market rewards velocity. If you're an AI-native company growing fast, the delta in pull and valuation is unprecedented,"" he said.Swaroop indicated a shift in investor perspectives. ""Everyone's looking for that breakout moment. Earlier, a company showing $1-2 million ARR might be considered early stage.

The value, it notes, is shifting to fintechs, private credit funds, non-bank liquidity providers, and digital-native banks.""Maturing digital assets appear to be on pace to cause significant disruption, with most banks currently on the outside looking in.""The fastest-growing players are also the most digitally savvy. Digital attacker banks clocked 85-100% CAGR in revenues over the past five years. Private credit players and retail trading platforms are close behind. Traditional banks, in contrast, posted only 10-15% CAGR, despite holding the largest share of balance-sheet assets. The challengers' edge stems from scalable platforms, lean cost structures, and a digital-first approach. ""Non-traditional bank competitors are generating new revenue pools,"" BCG says.""The best attackers are positioned for rapid growth, thanks to modern technology stacks and front-to-back digitised operating models.""The disruption extends beyond retail finance. In capital markets, boutique advisory firms and non-bank market makers are chipping away at incumbents' fee income.""Private credit has been gnawing away at bank share, particularly in the US,"" the report says.

Despite years of tech investment, efficiency improvements are slowing. ""Many banks struggle to counter these trends,"" BCG says, noting that pricing remains an underused lever. Neobanks' cost-to-serve, the report adds, is often a tenth that of incumbents. ""New competitors are winning on productivity.""Investors have picked up on this divergence.

Rupee may rise to 84/$ on US trade deal: BofA,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/rupee-may-rise-to-84/-on-us-trade-deal-bofa/articleshow/121632288.cms,"MUMBAI: An imminent trade deal with the US is seen as a positive catalyst for the rupee, which is expected to strengthen to 84 levels by the end of 2025, according to Bank of America. Other positives include soft oil prices, a benign current account deficit, and RBI's growth focus.In an interview with TOI, Adarsh Sinha, co-head of Asia forex & rates strategist at BofA, said the rupee would gain vis-a-vis the greenback partly because of the weaker dollar environment, but it will not appreciate as much as some of the G10 currencies and perhaps some emerging market currencies.""Generally, we're more constructive on the macro outlook for India... especially if you get this bilateral trade deal done with the US and now you have policy aligned as well.

""FDI is a longer-term story... I wouldn't say it's going to be a near-term swing factor,"" he said. He added that while foreign debt inflows increased over time, equity flows still dominate. On the dollar, Sinha said he is bearish.

If we start to see the real money community... hedge their US asset exposure more aggressively, then I think that's the next leg lower in the US dollar.""Sinha does not see any rush toward de-dollarisation, although central banks have been diversifying their foreign assets for some time. ""Yes, central banks might be moving away from the US dollar, they're probably buying gold, but it's happening at such a gradual pace that it doesn't really affect the short-term dynamics of the dollar.""""When you talk about de-dollarisation in terms of the global role of the US dollar, I don't see signs of that changing in a quick way... at least over the next five years, if not a bit longer, the dollar will be the dominant global currency,"" said Sinha.

This model is complex enough to stress test modern chips and expose their true training capabilities.According to the data, Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips.In the fastest result, a cluster of 2,496 Blackwell chips completed the training task in just 27 minutes. By contrast, more than three times that number of Hopper chips was needed to match or better that performance.At a press conference, Chetan Kapoor, chief product officer at CoreWeave — which collaborated with Nvidia on the benchmark tests — highlighted a broader industry trend.“Using a methodology like that, they're able to continue to accelerate or reduce the time to train some of these crazy, multi-trillion parameter model sizes,” Kapoor said, referring to a shift from massive monolithic systems to modular training infrastructures made up of smaller chip groups.The benchmark results underline Nvidia’s dominance in the AI training space, even as rivals like China’s DeepSeek claim competitive performance with fewer chips. As the race to power ever-larger AI systems intensifies, chip efficiency in training tasks remains a critical metric.","N Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips, new data shows.

Brendan Boyle of Pennsylvania, the top Democrat on the House Budget Committee. “In the words of Elon Musk,” Boyle added, referencing the billionaire and former Trump aide’s criticism of the plan, “this bill is a ‘disgusting abomination.’”The findings land at a critical juncture in the legislative process, as Trump urges Congress to finalize the package by the Fourth of July. The CBO’s assessment, considered a key benchmark for evaluating the fiscal impact of federal legislation, will be closely scrutinized by lawmakers and stakeholders seeking to understand the consequences of the more than 1,000-page proposal.In anticipation of the report, the White House and GOP leaders mounted a pre-emptive critique of the CBO, seeking to cast doubt on its findings. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the CBO has been “historically wrong,” and Senate Majority Leader John Thune argued the agency was “flat wrong” in its projections for Trump’s 2017 tax cuts. The CBO last year said government revenue was 5.6% higher than initially estimated, in part due to pandemic-era inflation spikes.Leavitt also suggested bias among CBO staff, despite the agency’s strict ethics rules that prohibit political activities and campaign contributions to ensure objectivity.Along with the projected costs, the CBO previously estimated that 8.6 million people would lose health coverage and 4 million fewer would receive monthly food stamps due to proposed cuts to Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).The bill — dubbed the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” echoing one of Trump’s signature catchphrases — is the GOP’s top legislative priority and faces unified Democratic opposition. Democrats, in turn, have labelled it Trump’s “big, ugly bill.”The legislation seeks to extend individual tax breaks from Trump’s 2017 tax overhaul that are set to expire in December unless Congress intervenes. It also introduces new tax measures, including an exemption on taxes for tips. The plan includes a $350 billion increase in funding for border security, deportations, and national defence.To offset some of the lost revenue, Republicans propose phasing out green energy tax credits implemented under President Joe Biden and introducing stricter work requirements for Medicaid and SNAP recipients up to age 65, starting in December 2026.The proposal also includes a Rs 4 trillion increase to the US debt ceiling, currently at Rs 36 trillion, allowing for continued government borrowing. The Treasury has warned that the ceiling must be raised this summer to avoid defaulting on existing obligations.Established in 1974 to serve as Congress’s independent fiscal referee, the CBO is now in its 50th year and employs about 275 economists, analysts, and staff. It was created to provide lawmakers with nonpartisan insights and serve as a counterweight to the White House’s Office of Management and Budget.The CBO’s current director, Phillip Swagel, who previously served under Republican President George W. Bush at the Treasury Department, was reappointed in 2023 to a second four-year term.","US President Donald Trump’s sweeping tax and spending legislation, now advancing through Congress, will cut taxes by $3.75 trillion.

For example, the average quarterly price increase for 2023 and 2024 was 4 per cent, compared to a 2.8 per cent rise in Q1 this year against Q4 2024,” said Ronan Arthur, MRICS, Director and Head of Residential Valuation at Cavendish Maxwell.“With a weakened US dollar, strong rental returns and appealing yields, Dubai continues to attract local and international property investors.We expect this trend to continue throughout the year,” Arthur added.Off-plan sales led the market with a 70 per cent share, amounting to AED 77.5 billion from 29,000 transactions — a 32 per cent increase year-on-year. Secondary market transactions stood at 13,200, reflecting a 6.6 per cent annual increase.Apartments comprised 75 per cent of all transactions, although interest in larger homes grew. Townhouses accounted for nearly 17 per cent of sales, while villas made up just over 7 per cent.Average property prices reached AED 1,535 per square foot, a 2.8 per cent quarterly increase and 16 per cent higher than in Q1 2024.The luxury segment saw 590 property sales priced above AED 20 million, up from 480 in the same period last year. Nearly 60 of those were for homes priced at AED 50 million or more. Arthur noted that off-plan sales made up 67 per cent of luxury transactions and nearly one-third of ultra-luxury sales.A surge in completions is expected in 2026 and 2027, with over 180,000 units scheduled for delivery.In Q1 2025, Jumeirah Village Circle (JVC) led all locations with 4,330 new units delivered. JVC also saw the highest number of apartment transactions at 3,330 — nearly 2,200 off-plan and 1,132 secondary market deals, reported Arabian Business.Mohammed Bin Rashid City followed with 1,037 units completed, ahead of Business Bay (743), Downtown Jebel Ali (647), and Rukan (636). Looking ahead, JVC is expected to receive almost 27,100 new units by 2028, trailed by Business Bay (19,470), Azizi Venice (17,100), DAMAC Lagoons (10,730), and Arjan (9,750).From January to March, apartments accounted for nearly 80 per cent of all completions. During the same period, 95 projects were launched, delivering around 28,600 new units.DAMAC Islands led off-plan villa and townhouse sales with 1,430 transactions, followed by The Valley, DAMAC Hills 2, Villanova, and DAMAC Lagoons. For secondary market sales in this segment, DAMAC Hills 2 topped the list with 318 deals, ahead of Al Furjan, Emirates Living, Reem, and JVC.Residential rents rose 14.4 per cent annually but showed only 1 per cent growth compared to Q4 2024 — the slowest quarterly rise in two years. “This slower pace of growth could be partly driven by the influx of new units delivered in the first three months of the year, as well as the Dubai Smart Rental Index, introduced at the beginning of the year, which is likely to influence tenant expectations and price adjustments. With additional supply on the way, monitoring how rental trends evolve in response to increasing inventory and a shifting, regulatory framework will be crucial,” Arthur said.As of March 2025, rental yields averaged 7.3 per cent for apartments and 5 per cent for villas and townhouses. Dubai Investments Park offered the highest yields for apartments at 10.3 per cent, followed by International City (9.1%), Downtown Jebel Ali (9%), Dubai Production City (8.6%), Dubai Silicon Oasis (8.5%), Dubai Sports City (8.4%), and Liwan and International City Phase 2 (8.2% each).For villas and townhouses, Industrial City led with yields of 6 per cent, followed by JVC at 5.9 per cent, DAMAC Hills 1 and 2 (5.7%), International City and Serena (5.5%), Mudon and Villa Nova (5.4%), and Dubai Hills Estate (5.3%).","Dubai recorded 42,000 property sales transactions valued at AED 114.4 billion ($31 bn) in the first quarter of 2025. Average property prices reached AED 1,535 per square foot, a 2.8 per cent quarterly increase and 16 per cent higher than in Q1 2024. Jumeirah Village Circle (JVC) led all locations with 4,330 new units delivered.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121626697,imgsize-1641219,width-400,resizemode-4/121626697.jpg"
Wall Street drifts after economic reports fuel Fed rate cut bets; Trump demands action,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-stock-market-june-4-dow-jones-sp-500-nasdaq-global-markets-wall-street-us-eu-trade-talks/articleshow/121625798.cms,"US stocks drifted modestly higher on Wednesday as fresh signs of economic weakness tempered momentum following a strong market rebound. The S&P 500 edged up 0.2% in afternoon trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose by 40 points, or 0.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.3% as of 1:09 p.m. Eastern time. The S&P 500 is now within 2.8% of its all-time high.Markets reacted more sharply in the bond space. Treasury yields dropped after two reports signalled a cooling economy. A survey from the Institute for Supply Management showed contraction in services sector activity last month—covering retail, finance, and other industries—where economists had expected growth. The ISM report cited businesses struggling to forecast and plan due to tariff-related uncertainty.Meanwhile, employment data from payroll firm ADP painted a weaker labour market, reporting that private employers added only 37,000 jobs in May, down from 60,000 the previous month. The sharp decline raised concerns about broader labour market health ahead of the US Labour Department’s monthly jobs report due Friday, a key indicator for Wall Street.“Whether this report is accurate or not, traders and investors will read today’s number as a dark result for trading today,” said Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics.“This may be the tip of an iceberg, but it also could be a false start.”The data spurred expectations that the Federal Reserve may need to cut interest rates later this year to support the economy. That led to a drop in Treasury yields, with the 10-year yield falling to 4.35% from 4.46% and the two-year yield easing to 3.87% from 3.96%.The ADP figures also prompted a reaction from former President Donald Trump, who called on Fed Chair Jerome Powell to act swiftly.“‘Too Late’ Powell must now LOWER THE RATE,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform. “He is unbelievable!!! Europe has lowered NINE TIMES!”While the Fed has held rates steady this year after aggressive cuts in 2023, it continues to assess how tariffs and inflation may affect economic conditions. Lowering rates too quickly could risk reigniting inflation.Bond market movements have also been influenced by growing investor concern over the US fiscal outlook, particularly as tax cut proposals raise the prospect of significantly higher federal debt. Investors are demanding higher yields to compensate for those risks.On the equities front, Hewlett Packard Enterprise climbed 0.7% after posting better-than-expected profits for the latest quarter. Wells Fargo rose 0.8% after the Federal Reserve lifted restrictions imposed in 2018, part of the bank's ongoing efforts to rebuild trust and overhaul its practices.Cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike fell 5.4% despite a stronger-than-expected profit. Revenue came in below analysts’ estimates, as did the company’s forecast for the current quarter. The company is also facing legal pressure from Delta Air Lines over a past technology outage.Globally, markets in Europe and Asia advanced as investors awaited updates from ongoing trade discussions. Optimism about a breakthrough in US-China negotiations has supported recent gains, though uncertainty remains high. On Wednesday, Trump signalled the complexity of those talks in a post about Chinese President Xi Jinping.“I like President XI of China, always have, and always will, but he is VERY TOUGH, AND EXTREMELY HARD TO MAKE A DEAL WITH!!!” Trump said.As trade discussions continued, European Union trade chief Maroš Šefčovič met with US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer on the side-lines of the OECD meeting.The financial markets will continue to look for direction from upcoming labor data and any concrete developments in US-China trade talks, with Fed policy expectations hanging in the balance.","US stocks drifted modestly higher on Wednesday as fresh signs of economic weakness tempered momentum.

Chinese AI gains reshape global AI race in Q1 2025: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/chinese-ai-gains-reshape-global-ai-race-in-q1-2025-report/articleshow/121620728.cms,"Chinese artificial intelligence advancements emerged as a major driving force in shaping the global AI landscape during the first quarter of 2025, according to a new report from Artificial Analysis, an independent AI benchmarking and insights provider.While the United States continues to dominate in reasoning models—with the top four spots on the Artificial Analysis Intelligence Index held by US labs—China has taken the lead in non-reasoning categories. The report notes that DeepSeek V3 0324 currently stands as the leading non-reasoning model, marking a significant milestone for Chinese AI labs, ANI reported.“The rise of Chinese AI Labs marked a notable shift in global competition. Chinese entities released models that rivalled US counterparts, particularly in open-weight models, with DeepSeek V3 0324 leading in non-reasoning categories,” the report highlights.Labs outside the US and China have made progress but are not yet contenders in the frontier intelligence space, the report adds.The global AI landscape remains highly dynamic, with continual progress driven by key players such as OpenAI, Google, and others.OpenAI’s o4-mini (high) has maintained its lead in overall performance, but competitors like Google’s Gemini 2.5 Pro and xAI’s Grok 3 have significantly narrowed the gap, intensifying the competition among top labs.Reasoning models, which solve problems by generating intermediate steps before reaching an answer, are identified in the report as a critical frontier. Their widespread adoption across major labs has yielded meaningful gains in intelligence and problem-solving capabilities.Artificial Analysis also points to technological shifts that have drastically reduced costs. The adoption of Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures, smaller model designs, optimized inference, and new hardware have led to a more than 32-fold drop in AI inference costs since September 2024, and over 1000-fold since the launch of GPT-4 in 2023. These efficiencies are rapidly making high-performance AI more accessible.Multimodal AI has also made significant strides, particularly in image and audio processing. OpenAI’s GPT-4o set new quality benchmarks in image generation, while text-to-speech capabilities across the board became increasingly lifelike, enhancing the naturalness of AI dialogue.Taken together, these trends signal a quarter marked by accelerated innovation, expanding access, and heightened global competition in the AI sector.","Chinese artificial intelligence advancements emerged as a major driving force in shaping the global AI landscape during the first quarter of 2025.

Labour unions in the United States are pushing back against Artificial Intelligence, demanding transparency, legal safeguards, and a voice for workers in the process, as industries adopt advanced AI tools—from generative chatbots to physical automation.Aaron Novik, a key organiser with Amazon’s ALU union, told news agency AFP, “As labourers, the ability to withhold our labour is one of our only tools to improve our lives. What happens when that disappears to AI?”AI could soon replace a wide range of blue-collar roles, while generative AI may wipe out nearly half of low-skilled white-collar jobs. This could push unemployment rates up to 20 percent, according to Anthropic’s CEO.Unions like the International Brotherhood of Teamsters have pushed for state-level legislation to restrict autonomous vehicles and robots. But progress is uneven. California and Colorado governors have vetoed recent bills banning autonomous trucks. Other states face similar challenges.At the federal level, former president Biden’s labour guidelines—encouraging transparency and protection for workers facing job loss—were scrapped by president Trump within hours of taking office.Despite the setbacks, some unions have managed wins. The Communications Workers of America (CWA) is educating members about AI, while SAG-AFTRA secured contractual guarantees around the use of AI likenesses. Dock workers and tech sector employees have also negotiated clauses limiting or managing automation.Still, most unions lack the influence of high-profile sectors. “Smaller contract-by-contract improvements are a long, slow process,” said RWDSU’s HeeWon Brindle-Khym.In an unrelated but significant news, a Florida woman, Megan Garcia, is suing Google and Character.AI, alleging the AI chatbot's role in her 14-year-old son's suicide. The lawsuit claims the chatbot manipulated the teenager, leading to his death. A US judge ruled last month that the lawsuit can proceed, rejecting the companies' free-speech defense, marking a significant legal challenge for AI accountability.","Unions in the U.S. are pushing back against Artificial Intelligence.

What Trump's 50% Tariffs Mean for the Steel Industry

What we know so far

United States has raised tariffs on imported steel and aluminium to 50% beginning Wednesday, according to a White House order signed by president Donald Trump. The decision, framed as a measure to protect domestic industries from foreign “dumping,” doubles the previous 25% levy imposed on these metals.According to the order, ""Increasing the previously imposed tariffs will provide greater support to these industries and reduce or eliminate the national security threat posed by imports of steel and aluminum articles and their derivative articles.""President Trump revealed the decision during a visit to a US steel plant in Pennsylvania last week. “At 25 percent, they can sort of get over that fence. At 50 percent, they can no longer get over the fence,” he told workers. “Nobody is going to be able to steal your industry,” he added, vowing stronger protection for American manufacturing.Steel and aluminium imports are currently taxed at 25% — a rate in place since 12 March, when president Trump’s order took effect, removing earlier exemptions on steel and raising aluminium tariffs from the levels set in his original 2018 trade measures.While some analysts say Trump’s first-term tariffs helped boost domestic steel and aluminium production, others caution that sharp new hikes could disrupt the industry’s ability to adapt.Many businesses that depend on imported steel and aluminium are already feeling the effects of Trump’s earlier tariffs. The new hikes are expected to push costs even higher. These metals are essential in products like washing machines, consumer electronics, and cars — industries that often rely on global supply chains, especially the automotive sector.Tariffs on UK imports will remain at 25%, as both countries continue trade talks under an earlier agreement, the hike targets other partners. The European Union has already warned of potential retaliation, saying the move undermines ongoing negotiations.Mexico, a major trading partner, plans to seek an exemption. Its economy minister Marcelo Ebrard argued the new tariffs are unfair, especially since the US exports more steel to Mexico than it imports. “It makes no sense,” he said.The latest tariff increase adds pressure to trade talks underway since April, when Trump reimposed 10% tariffs across multiple sectors. With the temporary pause on those hikes expiring in early July, diplomats now face a tightening window to reach workable solutions.","The US has raised tariffs on imported steel and aluminium to 50% beginning Wednesday.

Victoria’s Secret delays earnings release after cybersecurity breach disrupts operations,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/victorias-secret-delays-earnings-release-after-cybersecurity-breach-disrupts-operations/articleshow/121601082.cms,"Victoria’s Secret is postponing the release of its quarterly earnings after a security breach disrupted corporate operations and forced the popular lingerie brand to take its US shopping website offline for several days last week.In an update on Tuesday, the Ohio-based retailer said it first detected a “security incident involving its information technology systems” on May 24 and immediately activated its response protocols “to contain and eradicate unauthorized network access,” including engaging third-party experts, AP reported.As a precaution, the company temporarily shut down corporate systems and its US retail website on May 26. The website remained inaccessible for several days and was only restored late Thursday, causing ongoing frustration among customers.While Victoria’s Secret did not explicitly confirm a ransomware attack, analysts noted that the characteristics of the incident align with such threats, which have become increasingly common across the retail sector. The breach also impacted some in-store services at both Victoria’s Secret and Pink-branded outlets, though the company said most of those operations had since resumed.The cyberattack is also affecting the company's ability to release its first-quarter financial results. Victoria’s Secret said that it is still working to restore full access to its corporate systems, which has “prevented employees from accessing certain systems and information” required to complete its financial reporting.Despite the disruption, the company released preliminary first-quarter results for the period ending May 3, which predated the breach. It expects to report $1.35 billion in net sales and an adjusted operating income of $32 million—figures that exceed its previous guidance. Analysts polled by FactSet had forecast sales of approximately $1.33 billion.Victoria’s Secret has not announced a new date for the release of its complete first-quarter earnings report.The company maintained that the breach had no impact on its first-quarter results but added it would continue to “assess the full scope” of the incident, including any future financial implications.The Victoria’s Secret breach comes amid a broader surge in cybersecurity incidents targeting consumer-facing brands. In recent weeks, British retailers including Marks & Spencer, Harrods, and Co-op have reported cyberattacks, with M&S estimating a potential financial hit of 300 million pounds ($400 million) due to the disruption of online orders and supply chain issues.In a separate case last month, Adidas disclosed that consumer contact information had been accessed through a third-party customer service provider.Following such incidents, cybersecurity experts urge consumers to stay vigilant. They warn that fraudsters may exploit the situation by sending phishing emails, offering fake promotions, or attempting to misuse compromised data.","Victoria's Secret says it detected a ""security incident involving its information technology systems"" on May 24.

The index now sits within 3% of its all-time high, recovering significantly from a near 20% drop two months earlier. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 170 points, or 0.4%, while the Nasdaq Composite climbed 1%.Discount retailer Dollar General led notable gainers, surging 14.3% after reporting better-than-expected earnings and raising its full-year guidance. However, the company warned that “uncertainty exists for the remainder of the year” due to the potential effects of tariffs on its customer base.Trade-related uncertainty continues to weigh on corporate forecasts. Many companies have either withdrawn or lowered their financial projections, citing unpredictability in tariff implementation. On Tuesday, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) downgraded its US economic growth forecast for 2025 to 1.6%, from 2.8% last year.Despite pessimism about tariffs, current data shows limited immediate damage. Manufacturers are starting to feel pressure, but overall economic fundamentals—especially the labor market—remain solid. Inflation is subdued, and layoffs are still relatively low.New labour data showed job openings in the US exceeded expectations at the end of April, suggesting continued strength in hiring. This precedes Friday’s closely watched employment report, which will provide a fuller picture of job market trends in May.Investor sentiment was also buoyed by anticipation of potential progress in US-China trade relations. The US indicated that President Trump may speak with Chinese President Xi Jinping later this week. However, a spokesperson from China’s foreign ministry stated they had no information about such a call.Constellation Energy gained 0.7% after it finalized a 20-year agreement to supply Meta Platforms with electricity from its Clinton, Illinois, nuclear facility.In the bond market, yields were stable. The 10-year Treasury yield inched up to 4.47% from 4.46% the previous day. Earlier in the session, yields had dipped before recovering following the strong labor report.Yields have risen over the past two months amid concerns that the US government’s plans for large tax cuts could significantly increase federal debt. Higher yields tend to raise borrowing costs for consumers and businesses, and they can also weigh on equity valuations.Globally, most stock indices showed muted movements. European and Asian markets were mixed. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index stood out, rising 1.5% even as data revealed a slowdown in China’s manufacturing sector in May.Meanwhile, South Korean markets remained closed for a snap presidential election. The vote follows the dramatic removal of conservative leader Yoon Suk Yeol, who now faces a trial on rebellion charges tied to his attempt to impose martial law in December.","The S&P 500 rose 0.6% in afternoon trading, building on recent momentum following a strong May.

It expects US growth to decline further to 1.5% by 2026, and noted that average US tariff rates have surged from 2.5% to 15.4%, the highest level since 1938.“We have seen a significant increase in trade barriers as well as in economic and trade policy uncertainty. This sharp rise in uncertainty has negatively impacted business and consumer confidence and is set to hold back trade and investment,” said OECD chief economist Álvaro Pereira in an accompanying commentary.The Trump administration has imposed sweeping tariffs, including 10% taxes on imports from nearly all countries, and higher duties on steel, aluminium, and automobiles. Trump has also threatened to double some of these tariffs, further rattling markets.The legal future of these tariffs remains uncertain after a federal court in New York struck down many of them last week, only for an appeals court to temporarily reinstate them.The global economic outlook is also under strain, with the OECD predicting world growth to drop to 2.9% in 2025 and remain there through 2026, down from 3.3% in 2024 and 3.4% in 2023. While the global economy has shown resilience through crises like the COVID-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine, mounting trade frictions are now a key headwind.China’s economy, already hit by a real estate crisis, is forecast to slow from 5% in 2024 to 4.7% in 2025 and 4.3% in 2026, with Chinese exporters particularly vulnerable to US tariff increases. Beijing is expected to counter some of the pressure through monetary easing and public investment in sectors like manufacturing and elder care.Meanwhile, the eurozone is set to see a modest rebound, with growth projected to rise from 0.8% in 2024 to 1% in 2025, and 1.2% in 2026, aided by anticipated rate cuts from the European Central Bank.The OECD, a group of 38 advanced economies, provides policy recommendations and economic forecasts aimed at promoting global stability and prosperity.(With inputs from agencies)",The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) released its latest global outlook on Tuesday.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor ( CEA ) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September.

How India's GDP has been growing

What SBI report said on savings and investment

Incremental capital output ratio

NEW DELHI: India's gross domestic product (GDP) data for the third quarter (October-December 2022) received a word of caution from the former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan In an interview with news agency PTI, Rajan that India is ""dangerously close"" to the Hindu rate of growth in view of subdued private sector investment, high interest rates and slowing global growth.India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying"".However, a report released by the State Bank of India (SBI) economists on Tuesday dismissed arguments that India is dangerously close to Hindu rate of growth saying such statements are ""ill-conceived, biased and premature"".The term 'Hindu growth rate' was coined by late economist Raj Krishna in 1978 to describe the slow growth in the country.It basically refers to the low pace of economic growth rates during 1950s to 1980s. During this period, the Indian economy averaged 3.5%.A former lecturer at the Delhi School of Economics (DSE), Krishna noted that only if the rate of growth is persistently slow and accompanied by low per-capita GDP, then it will be known as Hindu rate of growth but it has to factor in population growth as well.Before economic reforms of 1991, India's economic growth remained stagnant and low, while per capita income averaged around 1.3%. Krishna termed this low growth situation to be a result of socialist policies of state control and import substitution.However, the economic situation changed when liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation (LPG) reforms came into effect in the year 1991, at a time when India faced balance of payment crisis.Over the years, many economists have strongly opposed the idea of 'Hindu growth rate' and the term never had universal acceptance.The Indian economy plunged into its very first technical recession in FY21 due to the impact of Covid-19 pandemic and the related nationwide lockdowns. GDP shrunk by an unprecedented 23.8% in the first quarter of the financial year 2020-21. However, due to spurt in economic activities in the subsequent quarters, the GDP decline started to narrow.However, if we look at the period before Covid-19 as well, India's growth curve shows a declining trend.From 8.26% in FY17, GDP growth plunged to 3.74% in FY20. Shutdown of economic activities in FY21 in wake of Covid-19 only made matters worse.As lockdowns started to ease and business activities resumed, India's GDP also started rising. In Q1 of FY22, growth jumped to 20.1% mainly on account of low base effect. By the fourth quarter of FY22, growth came down to 4.10%.Similarly, the new financial year 2022-23 brought fresh economic challenges in the form of Russia-Ukraine war that impacted almost all major economies of the world, slowed the pace of growth, pushed inflation to record highs.As a result, the central banks of all advanced economies spurred into action and opted for monetary policy tightening to curb the soaring inflation.With persistently rising interest rates, India's economy grew by 4.4% in Q3 of FY23, as the Centre revised upwards GDP growth for previous year to 9.10% from 8.7% earlier.The report weighed recent GDP numbers against the available data on savings and investments for the past decade and highlighted some interesting points.""Quarterly growth numbers are noisy and should be best avoided for any serious interpretation (on an average, India's GDP growth has witnessed Rs 2 lakh crore upward revision for the 3 year ended FY23),"" the report said.Gross capital formation (GCF) by the government touched a high of 11.8% in 2021-22, up from 10.7% in 2020-21.""This also had a domino effect on private sector investment that jumped from 10 per cent to 10.8% over the same period,"" it said.In fact, Ecowrap added that the trends in GCF to gross output ratio or the plough back of funds for creation of fresh capacity shows that for public administration the ratio attained fresh peak in 2021-22 owing to the emphasis on capital expenditure in recent budgets.At the aggregate level, gross capital formation is supposed to have crossed 32% in 2022-23, the highest level since 2018-19.According to the report, in 2021-22, gross savings have risen to 30% from 29% in 2020-21.""The ratio is supposed to have crossed 31 per cent in 2022-23, the highest since 2018-19. The household savings increased sharply during the pandemic period on account of sharp accretion in financial savings such as deposits,"" said the report by SBI's Economic Research Department.While household financial savings have since then moderated from 15.4% in 2020-21 to 11.1% in 2022-23, savings in physical assets have grown sharply to 11.8% in 2021-22 from 10.7% in 2020-21.The report further analysed Incremental Capital Output ratio (ICOR) -- which measures additional units of capital (investment) needed to produce additional units of output. It said that the ratio has been improving.""ICOR which was 7.5 in FY 12 is now only 3.5 in FY22. Clearly, only half of capital is now needed for next unit of output,"" the report noted.Such reducing ICOR in the current years reflects a relatively increasing efficiency of capital and shows that the economy is on a sound footing, the report said.""From that point of view, future GDP growth rates even at 7% could still mean a decent number by any standards!,"" it added.","India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.

An employee is entitled for a 50 per cent amount of the last drawn salary as pension.OPS was discontinued by the NDA government in 2003 with effect from April 1, 2004.Under the new pension scheme (NPS), employees contribute 10 per cent of their basic salary towards pension while the government contributes 14 per cent.Governments of Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand have informed the central government/ Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA about their decision to restart OPS for their employees.The government of Punjab on November 18, 2022, issued a notification regarding implementation of OPS for the state government employees who are being covered under NPS. Jharkhand too has decided to revert to OPS.",Former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan has expressed his concern over the decision of some states to restart the old pension scheme.

The meeting was chaired by Food Secretary Sanjeev Chopra.Out of the total wheat procurement target for the 2022-23 marketing year (April-March), Punjab will aim to procure 2.5 million tonnes wheat, Haryana 1.5 million tonnes and Madhya Pradrsh 2 million tonnes, the food ministry said in a statement.Wheat procurement had declined last year due to a fall in domestic production and higher exports.However, the government has projected a record wheat production at 112.18 million tonnes in the 2023-24 crop year (July-June) as per the second estimate of the agriculture ministry.Besides wheat, the government has also fixed rabi (winter) rice procurement target at 10.6 million tonnes in the 2022-23 marketing year.States have been advised to enhance rice milling capacity so that milling of one season gets completed before the commencement of next season and recycling of rice may be avoided.Whereas procurement of millets and coarse grains is estimated to be 7,50,000 tonnes this year, higher than 6,30,000 tonnes in 2021-22. Karnataka will procure 6,00,000 tonnes of millets this year, the statement added.Separately addressing the conference, food minister Piyush Goyal urged all state governments to implement smart-PDS at the earliest.He lauded Andhra Pradesh government's Command Control and stated that the central government will work together for implementing it in other states also.On the storage front, the Union minister said FCI is upgrading godowns into five-star rated ones and state governments can also upgrade their godowns.In the conference, all the state governments were told to learn from the best practice of using millets in schemes like mid-day meal and PDS in Karnataka, which is helpful in adding nutrition and promoting healthy diet.States were encouraged to procure more millets and coarse grains. All the state governments were asked to open procurement centres for coarse grains in producing districts, especially, in tribal areas. State governments were asked to encourage consumption of coarse grains as well.The conference also deliberated on fighting anaemia and nutritional deficiencies in various parts of the country by suitably creating awareness on benefits of fortified rice.The issues related to smart Public Distribution System (PDS) and One Nation One Ration Card scheme for seamless delivery of foodgrains to migrant beneficiaries were also discussed.FCI (Food Corporation of India) is the government's nodal agency that undertakes procurement and distribution of foodgrains for the PDS and welfare schemes.The best practice of command control centre by Andhra Pradesh for real time data on procurement, storage, quality and distribution of foodgrains was also discussed, for which all states have been urged to learn and adopt the methods to make their systems effective and efficient.Further, implementation of additional minimum threshold parameters for online procurement operations, i.e. integration of power validation of milled rice quantity with electricity consumption and tracking of vehicles used for transporting food grains were also deliberated upon for improving efficiency and transparency in procurement operations.During the discussion, it emerged that sufficient jute bags are available as per requirement of ensuing season. Issues related to finalisation of audited accounts, food subsidy claims and rationalisation of food subsidy was also deliberated upon.State governments have also been asked to submit their pending bills to FCI so that those can be settled in March 2023.",The government has fixed a wheat procurement target of 34.15 million tonnes for the 2023-24 marketing year starting April.

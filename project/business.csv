'Largest' tax refunds? How much cash will actually hit Americans’ bank accounts?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/largest-tax-refunds-how-much-cash-will-actually-hit-americans-bank-accounts/articleshow/125923537.cms,"White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt

How much each Americans will get?



Americans, you can rejoice as your wallet just got good news, even before the world gets its hands on GTA 6.On Thursday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said that Americans can expect an extra amount in their bank accounts in the months ahead, all because of Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which he signed into law in July.Leavitt told reporters, “Americans can expect another boost in their bank accounts in the months ahead.” She added that 2026 tax refunds are “projected to be the largest ever thanks to President [Donald] Trump’s passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill.”Citing analysis from investment bank Piper Sandler, Leavitt said refunds “could be about one-third larger than usual, or roughly an extra $1,000 per filer.”On Wednesday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told reporters that working Americans would receive “very large refunds” next year, amounting to about $1,000 to $2,000 per household. He said the increased refunds were a direct result of the tax cuts in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.The cost of living has been a central concern for many Americans in recent months. Democrats have criticised the Trump administration over affordability issues, while Republicans have backed the president’s tax legislation as delivering relief.In an X post on December 4, the White House said, Largest tax refund season in American history.Thanks to extended tax cuts and retroactive tax relief provided by the Working Family Tax Cuts.Representative Brendan Boyle, a Pennsylvanian Democrat, said in a December 9 X post, Trump called the cost-of-living crisis a ‘con,’ but now he’s in Pennsylvania claiming he’s lowering costs. His empty promises are the real con — and Pennsylvanians aren’t buying it. This is the same guy raising prices with his tariff taxes and taking health care from Americans.House Speaker Mike Johnson said in a December 10 X post, This is a LIFE-CHANGING boost for America’s children. And remember: Nearly EVERY Democrat voted to block this from happening.Taxes are due on April 15-2026. Americans typically receive their tax refunds within weeks of filing.","White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said that 2026 tax refunds are “projected to be the largest ever thanks to President [Donald] Trump’s passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill.” She said refunds “could be about one-third larger than usual, or roughly an extra $1,000 per filer”","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125923620,imgsize-892020,width-400,resizemode-4/pic-22.jpg"

MCX Gold prices are showing a firm bullish undertone, and the current market structure suggests the potential for further upside in the near term. As long as the metal sustains above the key support zone around ₹1,27,000, buyers are likely to remain active on dips, keeping overall sentiment positive. This support level has acted as a strong demand area in recent sessions, indicating that market participants are willing to accumulate positions whenever prices soften.On the upside, the next significant hurdle is placed near ₹1,34,000, which could be tested if momentum continues to build. A sustained move above immediate resistance levels, supported by favorable global cues such as softer bond yields, geopolitical concerns, or a weaker U.S. dollar, can accelerate buying interest. Additionally, ongoing expectations of central bank rate adjustments often play a key role in influencing gold prices, and any dovish signals can further strengthen the bullish trend.Traders may look for opportunities to buy on pullbacks as long as the price holds above the identified support.However, it is important to monitor volatility and global market developments closely. A decisive break above ₹1,34,000 could open the door for further gains, while a fall below ₹1,27,000 would weaken the current bullish outlook.MCX Silver is exhibiting strong bullish momentum, and the current market structure indicates the potential for an extended upside move. As long as prices hold above the crucial support zone at ₹1,84,500, the overall bias is expected to remain positive. This level has repeatedly acted as a reliable demand area, suggesting that traders and investors are willing to step in whenever the metal experiences short-term declines. Sustaining above this support reinforces confidence in the upward trend.On the higher side, silver has room to advance toward the ₹2,00,000 mark, which stands as the next notable target. A breakout above intermediate resistance levels, combined with favorable global market cues—such as easing U.S. yields, persistent inflation concerns, or a softer dollar—can provide the necessary momentum for silver to continue its upward march. Increasing industrial demand, particularly from renewable energy and electronics sectors, may also lend additional support.Traders may adopt a “buy on dips” approach as long as silver stays above its key support, keeping risk managed and aligned with the prevailing trend. However, it is important to watch global economic indicators and volatility closely. A clear move above ₹2,00,000 could signal further bullish extension, while a drop below ₹1,84,500 would weaken the current positive outlook.","Gold and silver are exhibiting signs of bullish breakout, says Abhilash Koikkara, Head - Forex & Commodities, Nuvama Professional Clients Group.

Rupee hits new record low: Currency weakens to 90.46 versus US dollar; RBI likely intervened to stem fall,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/rupee-hits-new-record-low-currency-weakens-to-90-46-versus-us-dollar-rbi-intervention-likely/articleshow/125907270.cms,"Rupee versus dollar (AI image)



RBI Slashes Rates After Rupee Fall, Boosts Liquidity And Lifts India’s GDP Forecast To 7.3%

The Indian rupee tanked to a fresh record low on Thursday, going past the 90 mark versus the US dollar again. The rupee has been depreciating sharply this year, influenced by ongoing challenges on the India-US trade deal front and increased corporate dollar demands.The rupee declined to 90.4675 versus the US dollar, surpassing its previous historic low of 90.42 recorded on December 4.The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) reportedly stepped in on Thursday to prevent further depreciation of the rupee's value, five traders were quoted as saying by Reuters.The rupee has declined over 5% against the dollar in 2025, ranking as the third-poorest performer amongst 31 primary currencies, with only the Turkish lira and Argentina's peso showing greater losses. This downward trend is significant, coming at a time when the dollar's strength measure has reduced by more than 7%.Several elements contribute to the rupee's negative performance, including growing trade deficits, hefty 50% US tariffs on Indian goods, and outward foreign capital movement. The lack of successful negotiations with the Donald Trump administration has further weakened the currency's position.The currency continues to experience pressure after falling past the crucial 90 mark, which is 50% of its 2011 value.This situation creates additional difficulties for RBI governor Sajay Malhotra and central bank officials in their efforts to maintain balance between rupee flexibility and market steadiness, while steering clear of past financial issues.India's capital controls restrict the rupee's convertibility, requiring RBI's participation in both domestic and international markets for intervention. In global markets, rupee trading occurs primarily through non-deliverable forwards (NDFs), which are derivatives contracts setting exchange rates with dollar settlements.The RBI implements interventions via the Bank for International Settlements, working alongside selected major banks as trading partners in continuous markets operating across Singapore, Dubai and London.","The Indian rupee tanked to a fresh record low on Thursday, going past the 90 mark versus the US dollar again.

The Dow rose 1.3%, driven by strong gains in banks and industrial stocks, while the S&P 500 also pushed into record territory, ending at 0.21% gain. The rally followed an upbeat session in Europe and a mixed day in Asia, with global markets continuing to respond positively to the Fed’s less hawkish tone on Wednesday (local time).But the Nasdaq’s 0.3% dip highlighed the market’s lingering nerves around AI-linked valuations. The Nasdaq, however, was weighed down by a sharp slump in Oracle shares that reignited long-standing worries about the soaring cost of artificial intelligence bets.""Even as investors were reassured by the Fed's latest rate cut, familiar concerns about AI are still very much top of mind right now,"" Deutsche Bank managing director Jim Reid told AFP.The concerns resurfaced after Oracle revealed late on Wednesday that its quarterly revenue had fallen short of expectations and that it had ramped up spending on data centres to expand AI capacity.The stock sank 10.8% by the close, having earlier fallen even further.Dave Grecsek of Aspiriant Wealth Management said the reaction highlighted the market’s discomfort with the scale of AI-related investments.""There's still a lot of apprehension about how sustainable some of these capital spending plans are, what the return on those investments are, and especially now that they're financed with debt,"" he said, as cited by AFP.Last month, global markets briefly faltered as investors were cautious by the AI bubble concept, questioning whether the massive sums flowing into artificial intelligence risked inflating a bubble that could eventually burst.The Fed’s rate cut, its third in a row, was anticipated, but an unusually high number of dissenting votes has clouded expectations over where borrowing costs are headed next.""Investors have shrugged off the Fed's latest reduction in US borrowing costs as it is becoming harder to guess where rates might go next,"" said AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould.Fed officials remain split on the outlook for 2026, including whether more cuts will be needed and how many. Still, eToro US analyst Bret Kenwell noted that Fed Chair Jerome Powell pointed out that none of the policymakers foresee rate hikes in 2026 in their baseline scenario.""The lack of an outright hawkish tone from the Fed combined with its third consecutive rate cut could pave the way for a potential year-end rally in equities, provided that next week's macroeconomic data doesn't derail the recent bullish momentum,"" Kenwell said.The reduction brings interest rates to their lowest level in three years as policymakers attempt to shore up a labour market that has shown signs of strain throughout 2025.The dollar weakened while oil prices slipped following the decision.Among corporate movers, Disney added 2.4% after unveiling a three-year licensing agreement with OpenAI, giving users the ability to create short AI-generated videos featuring popular Disney characters.","The Dow rose 1.3%, driven by strong gains in banks and industrial stocks.

Kotak Securities has a reduce rating on LG Electronics with the target price at Rs 1,600. Analysts said that the industry is witnessing a double-digit growth, led by volumes and premiumization. Its strong parentage and market leadership create a durable moat around LG India. Between Fy25 and Fy28, they estimate the company to show a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10% in revenue, 11% in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA), and 10% in earnings per share (EPS).Bernstein has an underperform rating on SBI Cards with the target price at Rs 780, up from Rs 690. Analysts said that credit costs are set to decline gradually, and more rate cuts are likely. However, they think these factors create enough tailwind to reconsider bearish views on SBI Cards. They see declining revolvers, a weaker franchise relative to peers, and the risk of credit-card substitutes.Nuvama has a buy rating on Yatharth Hospitals with the target price at Rs 920. Analysts said the company is an emerging hospital player in North India. It’s on a high growth path, with doubling bed capacity to fuel revenue growth.They also feel there’s significant headroom for Average Revenue Per Occupied Bed (ARPOB) and occupancy to scale up further.Goldman Sachs has a neutral rating on Nestle India with the target price at Rs 1,230, almost unchanged from Rs 1,225 earlier. Analysts expect the company to sustain its growth momentum and gross margin tailwinds likely to be reinvested. They also feel the recent cut in GST rates can accelerate growth for Nestle.Citigroup maintained its neutral rating on Siemens with the target price at Rs 3,425. Analysts said the company’s LV motors business sale to Innomotics at the same value as was proposed in a 2023 related-party transaction.

IndiGo offers 10k voucher to some flyers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/indigo-offers-10k-voucher-to-some-flyers/articleshow/125922076.cms,"IndiGo will issue Rs 10,000 travel vouchers to flyers severely impacted by disruptions on December 3-5, in addition to government-mandated compensation. This unprecedented payout follows thousands of flight cancellations, stranding passengers for hours. While the airline views these three days as the peak disruption period, affected passengers from December 6-7 are excluded from this specific voucher offer.

Flyers affected on December 6-7 won't get additional relief

NEW DELHI: The unprecedented scale of IndiGo flight disruptions this month will now lead to record compensation payout by the airline. IndiGo said Thursday it would issue a travel voucher of Rs 10,000 to each ""severely impacted"" flyer ""stranded at airports for many hours"" on Dec 3, 4 and 5. A conservative estimate of just over 2,500 flights and 150 flyers each comes to Rs 376 crore.This will be in addition to the Rs 5,000-Rs 10,000 to be paid as per govt norms. The vouchers can be used on IndiGo in the next 12 months. Between Dec 1 and 9, IndiGo cancelled 4,354 flights - 64 international and the remaining domestic. Of these, 90% or 3,920 flights were cancelled from Dec 3 to 7 (both days included). Affected passengers of Dec 6 and 7 are left out despite the high number of cancellations, more than those on Dec 4-5.The number of domestic flights cancelled on Dec 3, 4 & 5 was 2,456 domestic and 51 international. Estimating 150 passengers per flight of just these 2,507 cancelled flights and not those on the delayed ones whose flyers may also be eligible for vouchers, the airline may have to issue vouchers to more than 3.8 lakh travellers.Even this conservative estimate takes the payout beyond Rs 376 crore. The real number could be way higher.""IndiGo regrettably acknowledges that (some) of our customers travelling on Dec 3/4/5, 2025, were stranded for many hours at certain airports & number of them were severely impacted due to congestion. We will offer travel vouchers worth Rs 10,000 to such severely impacted customers,"" the airline said.""This is in addition to the commitment under existing govt guidelines as per which, IndiGo will provide compensation of Rs 5,000 to Rs 10,000 depending on the block time of the flight, to those customers whose flights were cancelled within 24 hours of departure time,"" the statement added. The airline's fiasco is being probed by multiple govt agencies and some affected passengers have moved court too. The final compensation payout for IndiGo remains to be seen.IndiGo views the three days between Dec 3 and 5 as the period of major disruptions. Dec 6 and 7, it sees as ""execution of network adjustments as per guidance from the authorities""; Dec 8 as ""day of transition"", and from Dec 9, it sees operations as stabilising.","IndiGo will issue a travel voucher of Rs 10,000 to each ""severely impacted"" flyer ""stranded at airports for many hours"" on Dec 3, 4 and 5.

SpiceJet plans expansion with 100 more flights daily amidst IndiGo fiasco; airline aims to 'improve overall network resilience',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/spicejet-plans-expansion-with-100-more-flights-daily-amidst-indigo-fiasco-airline-aims-to-improve-overall-network-resilience-stock-jumps-5/articleshow/125884444.cms,"As IndiGo Spirals Into Crisis, PM Modi Stresses Rules Must Ease Citizens’ Lives, Not Burden Them

IndiGo's operational meltdown





Shocks spill to the wider market





As India's aviation industry is grappling with ongoing IndiGo crisis, SpiceJet has launched a major winter push to fulfil the continued demand. In a statement released on Wednesday, the carrier outlined plans to add up to 100 daily flights during the ongoing winter schedule, noting that the expansion is still subject to regulatory approval. The airline, as cited by ET, said that the move reflects “strong and growing demand across key routes.”The carrier has been steadily building capacity ahead of the announcement. Seventeen aircraft have returned to operations over the past two months through a mix of damp leases and the revival of its own grounded planes, with more inductions expected. According to the airline, the additions provide “operational flexibility to deploy incremental capacity on high-demand routes and improve overall network resilience. ” It further told ET added that its strategy is centred on “maximising aircraft utilisation, strengthening connectivity and better aligning capacity with demand.”The expansion marks a year-end acceleration for SpiceJet, combining a larger fleet with increased frequencies at a time when IndiGo’s troubles have created a rare opening in the domestic market.The market response has been swift. SpiceJet’s stock rose as much as 5% on December 10, reaching an intraday high of Rs 36.The jump extends a four-day rally that has lifted the share price by 19% in just a few sessions. As of 12:55 the stock was trading at Rs 34, up 1.5%, on the BSE.The surge comes as IndiGo faces the possibility of penalties for its handling of the turmoil that unfolded over the past several days. The airline cancelled more than 5,000 flights due to a shortage of pilots, prompting the government to order a 10% reduction in its approved winter schedule. The cut translates to roughly 110 flights a day being reassigned to other carriers.IndiGo’s operational collapse has been striking for an airline that typically commands about two-thirds of India’s domestic traffic. The carrier’s on-time performance plunged to 8.5%, leading to large-scale cancellations across major hubs including Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru and Hyderabad. The DGCA noted that IndiGo could not support the ~15,014 weekly departures allocated to it for the winter schedule and has directed a reduction, ET reported.The disruptions left thousands of passengers facing last-minute changes and urgent searches for alternative flights. SpiceJet’s latest expansion aligns with this moment, as gaps left by IndiGo create immediate room for other domestic players to add capacity.Travellers may see short-term relief as SpiceJet introduces more flights, which could ease pressure on busy routes affected by IndiGo’s cancellations. Better connectivity and additional choices are expected as the new flights roll out.For the aviation sector, IndiGo’s setbacks and SpiceJet’s rapid scale-up signal a potential rebalancing of market share during the winter travel period. With the regulator already stepping in to curb IndiGo’s schedule, the industry may face closer oversight of capacity management and service reliability going forward.","SpiceJet plans to add up to 100 daily flights during the ongoing winter schedule.

NEW YORK: After three consecutive interest rate cuts, investors now confront an uncertain US monetary policy outlook for the year ahead, clouded by persistent inflation, data gaps, and an impending leadership change at Federal Reserve.The US Federal Reserve cut interest rates by a quarter-percentage point on Wednesday in an uncommonly divided vote, but signaled it would likely pause further reductions in borrowing costs as officials look for clearer signals about the direction of the job market and inflation that ""remains somewhat elevated"".The Fed's projection for a slower easing path contrasts with market expectations for two 0.25% cuts in 2026, which would bring the fed funds rate to about 3.0%. Policymakers see only one cut next year and one in 2027. Wednesday's cut brought the policy rate to a range of 3.50%-3.75%.The central bank's updated projections showed six policymakers preferring no rate cut this year, and seven anticipating no further cuts in 2026.How monetary policy evolves from here will hinge on economic data that is still lagging from the impact of the 43-day federal govt shutdown in Oct and Nov. This comes as the US heads into a midterm-election year likely to focus on economic performance, with President Donald Trump urging sharper rate reductions.""I think the guessing game of what the Fed does next is going to be getting a lot more difficult next year,"" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B Riley Wealth.","The US Federal Reserve cut interest rates by a quarter-percentage point on Wednesday in an uncommonly divided vote.

Cyber resilience core to sovereignty: Satya Nadella,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/cyber-resilience-core-to-sovereignty-nadella/articleshow/125920974.cms,"Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella emphasized cyber resilience as crucial for sovereignty, warning that isolation from global threat intelligence creates vulnerabilities. He highlighted AI's role in evolving software development and announced significant AI partnerships in India, underscoring a new era of innovation driven by data and multi-model reasoning for enhanced decision-making.

BENGALURU: Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has insisted that cyber resilience must be an essential pillar of any strategy surrounding sovereignty. He cautioned that autonomy without access to global threat intelligence can create vulnerabilities.While countries are increasingly building sovereign data infrastructure, and mandating that local data remains within the country's borders, Nadella noted that cyber threats can come from any part of the world, and it is important for sovereign infrastructures to be open to the global intelligence around these threats.Nadella, who was here on Thursday as part of the Microsoft AI Tour, argued that cybersecurity today is fundamentally ""a signals game, an intelligence game"", making it vital that nations and enterprises benefit from global threat visibility. He urged leaders to view sovereignty and resilience not as competing priorities but as a single risk equation. Microsoft, he said, gives govts and enterprises a range of choices across public, private, and sovereign cloud offerings.Nadella also announced strategic partnerships with Cognizant, Infosys, TCS and Wipro to accelerate the adoption of agentic AI.Each of these companies will deploy over 50,000 Microsoft Copilot licenses-collectively surpassing 200,000 licenses-and setting a new benchmark for enterprise-scale AI adoption.This comes a day after Microsoft committed $17.5 billion in investment in India, focusing on AI infrastructure, skilling, and sovereign capabilities, marking Microsoft's biggest investment anywhere in Asia.Nadella also underscored that the next era of innovation will be defined by a fundamental shift in how developers build solutions. He stressed that technology must advance outcomes, not innovation for its own sake. The classic SDLC (software development lifecycle), he said, has to evolve into a new form of AI-driven SDLC. Data, he noted, becomes the core of this shift. ""When we talk about context engineering, it's a little bit of good old data engineering. .. where you want to get your data into the shape that allows you to feed it to the intelligence and then orchestrate around it.""Nadella spoke about the value of the AI LLM Council, a decision-making framework inspired by OpenAI cofounder Andrej Karpathy's idea, where multiple large language models-including GPT, Gemini and DeepSeek-act as ""council members"". A chair model then synthesises their collective reasoning.Nadella illustrated this with an example: asking the council to select an all-time Indian cricket XI. The models agreed on legends like Sunil Gavaskar, Virender Sehwag, Rahul Dravid, Sachin Tendulkar, Virat Kohli, Kapil Dev, R Ashwin and Jasprit Bumrah, while debating choices such as VVS Laxman and Anil Kumble versus Zaheer Khan.Nadella described this multi-model debate as ""a chain of debate, not a chain of thought""-a glimpse into the next generation of metacognition, where AI agents contribute to human decision-making by reasoning, disagreeing, and synthesising outcomes.",Satya Nadella: Cyber resilience must be an essential pillar of any strategy surrounding sovereignty.

AP reported that the prior week’s reading was likely distorted by the Thanksgiving holiday.Unemployment-aid applications are widely viewed as a proxy for layoffs and provide one of the timeliest indicators of labour-market conditions. While headline claims remain relatively low, the Federal Reserve on Wednesday cut its benchmark lending rate for the third consecutive time, citing worries that the job market is weaker than headline data suggests.Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank moved to ease borrowing costs because hiring appears far softer than reported. Although government figures show the economy has added an average of 40,000 jobs per month since April, Powell noted these numbers “could be revised lower by as much as 60,000,” indicating employers may actually have shed around 20,000 jobs a month.“It’s a labor market that seems to have significant downside risks,” Powell said. “People care about that. That’s their jobs.”Despite muted layoffs, hiring has also slowed, creating what economists describe as a “low-hire, low-fire” environment that has kept unemployment historically low but made job searches increasingly difficult.Private payrolls firm ADP last week estimated 32,000 job losses in November, aligning with recent federal data showing a marked drop in job creation following President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs imposed in April.

SpaceX IPO: Investors brace for ‘craziest IPO ever’; why Elon Musk’s $1.5–2 trillion debut is stirring frenzy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/spacex-ipo-investors-brace-for-craziest-ipo-ever-why-elon-musks-1-52-trillion-debut-is-stirring-frenzy/articleshow/125917985.cms,"Risks, governance drama and Musk factor not deterring backers

‘Steak and sizzle’: Why institutions say SpaceX is IPO-ready

History says sky-high valuations rarely deliver lasting gains

Investors are cheering early signals that Elon Musk ’s SpaceX may head for an initial public offering next year, in what some market participants told Reuters could become the “craziest IPO in the history of the stock market.” The rocket and satellite company, long considered one of the world’s most valuable private firms, is exploring a listing that could value it at more than $1 trillion, with potential fundraising expected to exceed $25 billion, according to a person familiar with the matter, Reuters reported.Demand from retail investors alone is expected to be “substantial,” said Shay Boloor, chief market strategist at Futurum Equities Research. “It’s going to be the craziest IPO in the history of the stock market. If it's trying to go for $1.5 trillion, I wouldn't be surprised if it goes up to over $2 trillion once it gets open,” he said.SpaceX’s established launch business and Starlink’s fast-growing communications network have strengthened investor confidence, even though the space sector remains a high-risk, capital-intensive industry. Many investors have waited years for an opportunity to buy into SpaceX, which has remained private despite consistently raising capital at soaring valuations.Despite Musk’s combative history with regulators and his unorthodox corporate leadership style, investors and analysts said these factors are unlikely to dampen enthusiasm. Musk, who oversees five companies including infrastructure venture The Boring Company and AI firm xAI, has frequently clashed with authorities. His tenure at Tesla—the only publicly listed firm he leads—has featured civil penalties, SEC disputes and pressure over governance matters.He once called SEC officials “bastards” after the agency removed him as Tesla chairman and restricted his social-media use following his 2018 “funding secured” tweet. Earlier this year, Musk threatened to leave Tesla if its board did not approve an unprecedented $1 trillion, 10-year compensation package. Tesla’s stock and sales later weakened after Musk spent four months leading the Trump administration’s Department of Government Efficiency.Still, analysts say investors view such volatility as part of the Musk premium. “The reward has to compensate holders for the risk,” said Christopher Marangi, co-chief investment officer for value at GAMCO Investors. GAMCO has indirect exposure to SpaceX through EchoStar, which received the company’s shares in a recent spectrum deal.It is “too speculative” to predict whether GAMCO would add more shares in a potential IPO, Marangi said, but noted strong interest in “space-oriented companies,” adding that GAMCO also holds a stake in Telesat.Institutional investors also appear prepared to bid aggressively. Dan Hanson, senior portfolio manager at Neuberger Berman’s $2.1 billion Quality Equity Fund, said SpaceX offers both strong current operations and vast long-term potential. The fund held roughly 5% of its assets in unlisted SpaceX shares as of November.“This is the rare situation where you have both the steak and the sizzle,” Hanson said. SpaceX’s operational businesses—launch services and Starlink—would help justify a strong public-market valuation, he added.IPO proceeds could also help finance new technologies, including space-based data centres that consume far less energy for cooling than Earth-based ones.“It has all the markings of a market darling in today's technology revolution,” said James St Aubin, chief investment officer at Ocean Park Asset Management, which does not own SpaceX. He said investors may soon refer to the “Great Eight” big tech group if SpaceX goes public in 2026, expanding on the current “Magnificent Seven.”But history offers a cautionary tale. University of Florida IPO expert Jay Ritter found that from 1980 to 2023, 45 companies with large revenues and valuations exceeding 40 times sales on debut have rarely held up. Only seven were trading higher three years later. On average, these firms lost half their value from the first-day close and lagged the broader market by 63%.Notable laggards include Beyond Meat’s 2019 debut, Palm’s 2000 listing and Snowflake’s 2020 IPO. Datadog and Zoom, both listed in 2019, are among the few exceptions. Tesla, which went public in 2010 at a relatively modest valuation, has been an outlier with massive long-term gains.“The extremely high valuation that SpaceX has been able to get does remove some upside potential,” Ritter said. “Even if it becomes a $2 trillion company that's only going to be a return of 100% or 200%.”","SpaceX is exploring a listing that could value it at more than $1 trillion, according to a person familiar with the matter.

Trade shift: US deficit shrinks to 2020 low; tariff hikes reshape import flows,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/trade-shift-us-deficit-shrinks-to-2020-low-tariff-hikes-reshape-import-flows/articleshow/125917374.cms,"'Best Offers Ever': US Official Reveals India Trade Talks Details, Says It Marks Unusual Opening

The US trade deficit has unexpectedly narrowed to its smallest level since 2020 as President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariff hikes altered import behaviour, according to delayed Commerce Department data released on Thursday.The deficit fell 10.9% to $52.8 billion in September, even as exports rose 3% to $289.3 billion and imports edged up 0.6% to $342.1 billion, AFP reported. The release is among a set of economic indicators that were delayed due to the record-long federal government shutdown between October and mid-November.The figures highlight how the year’s tariff escalations — including global increases that took effect on August 7 — have weighed on trade flows. Importers front-loaded purchases ahead of planned duty hikes, while Washington’s multi-country tariff push also dampened inbound shipments.Economists had expected the September deficit to widen to $62 billion, according to surveys by Dow Jones Newswires and The Wall Street Journal.Trump’s steeper tariffs, imposed on economies including the European Union and Japan, along with tit-for-tat duties with China that climbed to triple-digit levels earlier this year, have disrupted normal flows of goods.Yale University’s Budget Lab has estimated that the overall effective tariff rate paid by US consumers is at its highest since the 1930s.Despite the narrower deficit, analysts caution against reading too much into the September data. Oliver Allen, senior US economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said in a note that the sharp decline was “almost entirely due to a big jump in exports of gold bullion” and is likely to unwind in the fourth quarter. He added that tariffs “have so far failed to spark a big wave of import substitution.”Commerce Department data showed that while overall goods imports rose, categories such as capital goods — including computers and electrical apparatus — declined. Goods exports increased across consumer products, pharmaceutical preparations and industrial supplies.","The US trade deficit has unexpectedly narrowed to its smallest level since 2020.

Prada has decided to work with Indian artisans to create a limited-edition sandal collection, months after the brand faced criticism for using designs similar to traditional Kolhapuri chappals, reported Reuters.The Italian luxury company will produce 2,000 pairs in Maharashtra and Karnataka, selling each pair for about 800 euros, according to the report.Prada’s senior executive Lorenzo Bertelli told Reuters that the idea is to mix traditional Indian skills with Italian manufacturing techniques. The sandals will go on sale in February 2026 across 40 Prada stores worldwide and online.The move comes after a backlash six months ago, when Prada showcased sandals in Milan that resembled Kolhapuri chappals. Photos spread quickly online, leading to anger in India. Prada later accepted that the design drew from ancient Indian styles.The company has now signed agreements with two government-backed organisations LIDCOM in Maharashtra and LIDKAR in Karnataka,. These groups mainly support artisans from marginalised communities who make traditional chappals by hand.Bertelli said the aim is to bring global attention to this craft. The partnership will run for three years and will include training programmes for artisans in India and short training opportunities at Prada’s Academy in Italy. He said the project will cost several million euros and assured that artisans will be paid fairly.Prerna Deshbhratar, managing director of LIDCOM, said that once a global brand like Prada supports this craft, demand is likely to grow naturally.","The Italian luxury company will produce 2,000 pairs in Maharashtra and Karnataka, selling each pair for about 800 euros.

Investors, however, drew comfort from Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s post-meeting comments, where he struck a tone that was ""less hawkish"" than feared.After a positive close on Wall Street, most Asian markets advanced. Hong Kong, Sydney, Seoul, Singapore, Wellington, Manila and Jakarta all traded higher.While, Tokyo, Shanghai and Taipei slipped.Policymakers are attempting to bolster the US labour market, which has shown persistent weakness through the year. Concerns over slowing jobs growth have increasingly outweighed worries about elevated inflation, with some officials expecting the price impact of Donald Trump’s tariffs to ease over time, reported AFP.Expectations for aggressive easing in 2026 have cooled after the Fed used language similar to late-2024 — widely interpreted then as signalling a pause in its latest statement.Two policymakers dissented. Trump appointee Stephen Miran voted for a deeper 50-basis-point cut, while another member opposed any cut at all.Powell emphasised that the central bank remained flexible, saying officials are well placed to decide the ""extent and timing of additional adjustments based on the incoming data, the evolving outlook and the balance of risks"".The US dollar weakened further against major global currencies.

Trump's $1m ‘Gold Card’ visa unveiled: What applicants stand to gain; what remains off-limits,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/trumps-1m-gold-card-visa-unveiled-what-applicants-stand-to-gain-what-remains-off-limits/articleshow/125900784.cms,"Donald Trump’s ‘Gold Card’ Promises New Path For Indians, US Allows Companies To Hire Top Graduates

What 'Gold Card' gets you?



Fastrack legal residency and US citizenship



Access for top tier graduates and skilled labour



$15,000 vetting fee



What it doesn’t get you



No job obligations, no mention of caps



No guarantee of lower costs for businesses



Not a departure from merit-based immigration politics



US President Donald Trump on Wednesday unveiled his long-anticipated “gold card,” a high-priced immigration offering designed to grant legal status, and eventually US citizenship, to individuals and companies willing to pay significant sums.Framed as a replacement for the three-decade-old EB-5 investor visa, the new programme opens the door to permanent residency for foreign nationals ready to invest $1 million personally or $2 million through their employers. Trump has cast the gold card as a way to attract the world’s “best people,” pitching it not only as a magnet for elite graduates from US universities but also as a revenue generator for the federal government.The rollout comes against the backdrop of Trump’s strict immigration crackdowns. Even as his government has pursued mass deportations and tightened border controls, Trump has repeatedly argued that exceptional foreign-born talent should be allowed to stay.""THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT’S TRUMP GOLD CARD IS HERE TODAY! A direct path to Citizenship for all qualified and vetted people. SO EXCITING! Our Great American Companies can finally keep their invaluable Talent,"" Trump said in a post on Truth Social.Despite its branding, the “gold card” is essentially a revamped green card, but one that Trump touts as “much better” and offering a “stronger path.”Holders receive permanent legal residency, meaning they can live and work in the United States indefinitely and, over time, pursue US citizenship.Unlike the EB-5 programme, which hinges on job-creation requirements, the new card’s criteria appear streamlined: payment of the required fee and completion of background vetting.Green Cards are accessible via multiple routes including sponsorship, lotteries, or EB-5 investments starting at $800,000 with job creation requirements. Gold Cards require a $5 million direct payment (or sometimes cited as $1 million for a base version), bypassing traditional processes for faster approval aimed at economic benefit.Under the Gold Card program, a successful applicant would receive lawful permanent resident status under the EB-1 or EB-2 visa categories, as determined by the US department of homeland security and subject to availability.One of Trump’s central arguments for the programme is its ability to retain highly skilled graduates from US universities, particularly those from China, India, and France.Businesses, he has said, routinely lose world-class candidates because their visa status is uncertain. The gold card aims to remove that barrier, offering companies the opportunity to secure permanent residency for prized recruits, with each card tied to a single individual.""Tremendous people won't have to say they graduated from college and have to go back to India, China, France; we're taking care of that,"" Trump said as he launched the card.""You can't hire people from the best colleges because you don't know whether or not you can keep the person,"" the US president said.Every application includes a $15,000 vetting fee to fund thorough background checks, according to commerce secretary Howard Lutnick.The administration has framed this level of scrutiny as ensuring only top-qualifying individuals obtain residency.Meanwhile, Trump emphasized the programme’s fiscal upside, promising all proceeds will go directly to the US government to fund “positive” national initiatives.Unlike the EB-5 system it replaces, the gold card comes with no stated requirements for job creation by investors or employers.Trump’s announcement also omitted any reference to annual caps or limitations on the number of cards available.This leaves questions about oversight, scalability, and how the programme fits into broader immigration policy frameworks.While corporations can purchase multiple cards, each one applies to only one employee, meaning costs scale directly with the number of hires.Companies seeking to retain multiple foreign-born graduates could find themselves paying millions, a model that favors well-capitalized employers and wealthy individuals but may not help smaller firms struggling with talent shortages.Despite Trump’s hardline stance on immigration elsewhere, the gold card neither resolves nor escapes the political tensions within his base.Critics within the MAGA movement have objected to policies that increase legal immigration, even in selective forms.Although framed as “bringing in the best people,” the programme does not address broader concerns around fairness, accessibility, or the treatment of immigrants without wealth or elite credentials.","US President Donald Trump unveiled his long-anticipated 'gold card' on Wednesday.

NEW DELHI: More than 1.14 lakh startups in India have created over 12 lakh jobs so far, the finance ministry said in its latest review of the Indian economy.In the report titled, ‘The Indian Economy: A Review January 2024’, the Department of Economic Affairs said that the 1.14 lakh startups recognised by the government under the 'Startup India initiative’ created more than 12 lakh jobs (as of October 2023).The state-owned e-commerce platform Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) clocked more than 63 lakh transactions till November 2023, the document read.Despite facing global challenges in 2023 like valuation issues, few IPOs, regulatory changes and macroeconomic and geopolitical trends, India remains the third largest tech start-up ecosystem globally, with over 950 tech startups founded last year.The cumulative funding for more than 31,000 tech start ups has exceeded $70 billion (from 2019 to 2023), according to a recent report by Nasscom in collaboration with Zinnov.“In 2023, despite facing global economic and regulatory challenges, Indian tech startups have prioritised the imperative of enhancing their business fundamentals, driving profitability and growth,” said Debjani Ghosh, President, Nasscom.“The proliferation of tech startups in tier 2 and 3 cities marks the ecosystem's resilience,” she added.Navigating 2024, tech startup founders expect to continue the revenue growth path with measured steps focusing on optimising expenditure and maximising profitability for B2B tech startups.Investments in deeptech will continue an upward trend in 2024.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart.

That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says. Udaan competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods. The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-105001128,imgsize-151312,width-400,resizemode-4/105001128.jpg"

Explainer: What is 'Hindu rate of growth' and why Raghuram Rajan's remarks may be 'premature',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/explainer-what-is-hindu-rate-of-growth-and-why-raghuram-rajans-remarks-may-be-premature/articleshow/98482598.cms,"What is meant by Hindu growth rate

How India's GDP has been growing

What SBI report said on savings and investment

Incremental capital output ratio

NEW DELHI: India's gross domestic product (GDP) data for the third quarter (October-December 2022) received a word of caution from the former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan In an interview with news agency PTI, Rajan that India is ""dangerously close"" to the Hindu rate of growth in view of subdued private sector investment, high interest rates and slowing global growth.India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying"".However, a report released by the State Bank of India (SBI) economists on Tuesday dismissed arguments that India is dangerously close to Hindu rate of growth saying such statements are ""ill-conceived, biased and premature"".The term 'Hindu growth rate' was coined by late economist Raj Krishna in 1978 to describe the slow growth in the country.It basically refers to the low pace of economic growth rates during 1950s to 1980s. During this period, the Indian economy averaged 3.5%.A former lecturer at the Delhi School of Economics (DSE), Krishna noted that only if the rate of growth is persistently slow and accompanied by low per-capita GDP, then it will be known as Hindu rate of growth but it has to factor in population growth as well.Before economic reforms of 1991, India's economic growth remained stagnant and low, while per capita income averaged around 1.3%.Krishna termed this low growth situation to be a result of socialist policies of state control and import substitution.However, the economic situation changed when liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation (LPG) reforms came into effect in the year 1991, at a time when India faced balance of payment crisis.Over the years, many economists have strongly opposed the idea of 'Hindu growth rate' and the term never had universal acceptance.The Indian economy plunged into its very first technical recession in FY21 due to the impact of Covid-19 pandemic and the related nationwide lockdowns. GDP shrunk by an unprecedented 23.8% in the first quarter of the financial year 2020-21. However, due to spurt in economic activities in the subsequent quarters, the GDP decline started to narrow.However, if we look at the period before Covid-19 as well, India's growth curve shows a declining trend.From 8.26% in FY17, GDP growth plunged to 3.74% in FY20. Shutdown of economic activities in FY21 in wake of Covid-19 only made matters worse.As lockdowns started to ease and business activities resumed, India's GDP also started rising. In Q1 of FY22, growth jumped to 20.1% mainly on account of low base effect. By the fourth quarter of FY22, growth came down to 4.10%.Similarly, the new financial year 2022-23 brought fresh economic challenges in the form of Russia-Ukraine war that impacted almost all major economies of the world, slowed the pace of growth, pushed inflation to record highs.As a result, the central banks of all advanced economies spurred into action and opted for monetary policy tightening to curb the soaring inflation.With persistently rising interest rates, India's economy grew by 4.4% in Q3 of FY23, as the Centre revised upwards GDP growth for previous year to 9.10% from 8.7% earlier.The report weighed recent GDP numbers against the available data on savings and investments for the past decade and highlighted some interesting points.""Quarterly growth numbers are noisy and should be best avoided for any serious interpretation (on an average, India's GDP growth has witnessed Rs 2 lakh crore upward revision for the 3 year ended FY23),"" the report said.Gross capital formation (GCF) by the government touched a high of 11.8% in 2021-22, up from 10.7% in 2020-21.""This also had a domino effect on private sector investment that jumped from 10 per cent to 10.8% over the same period,"" it said.In fact, Ecowrap added that the trends in GCF to gross output ratio or the plough back of funds for creation of fresh capacity shows that for public administration the ratio attained fresh peak in 2021-22 owing to the emphasis on capital expenditure in recent budgets.At the aggregate level, gross capital formation is supposed to have crossed 32% in 2022-23, the highest level since 2018-19.According to the report, in 2021-22, gross savings have risen to 30% from 29% in 2020-21.""The ratio is supposed to have crossed 31 per cent in 2022-23, the highest since 2018-19. The household savings increased sharply during the pandemic period on account of sharp accretion in financial savings such as deposits,"" said the report by SBI's Economic Research Department.While household financial savings have since then moderated from 15.4% in 2020-21 to 11.1% in 2022-23, savings in physical assets have grown sharply to 11.8% in 2021-22 from 10.7% in 2020-21.The report further analysed Incremental Capital Output ratio (ICOR) -- which measures additional units of capital (investment) needed to produce additional units of output. It said that the ratio has been improving.""ICOR which was 7.5 in FY 12 is now only 3.5 in FY22. Clearly, only half of capital is now needed for next unit of output,"" the report noted.Such reducing ICOR in the current years reflects a relatively increasing efficiency of capital and shows that the economy is on a sound footing, the report said.""From that point of view, future GDP growth rates even at 7% could still mean a decent number by any standards!,"" it added.","India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.

An employee is entitled for a 50 per cent amount of the last drawn salary as pension.OPS was discontinued by the NDA government in 2003 with effect from April 1, 2004.Under the new pension scheme (NPS), employees contribute 10 per cent of their basic salary towards pension while the government contributes 14 per cent.Governments of Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand have informed the central government/ Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA about their decision to restart OPS for their employees.The government of Punjab on November 18, 2022, issued a notification regarding implementation of OPS for the state government employees who are being covered under NPS. Jharkhand too has decided to revert to OPS.",Former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan has expressed his concern over the decision of some states to restart the old pension scheme.

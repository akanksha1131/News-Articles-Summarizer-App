"Excise policy protest: Maharashtra bars, permit rooms to shut on July 14; Industry body calls tax hikes 'draconian'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/excise-policy-protest-maharashtra-bars-permit-rooms-to-shut-on-july-14-industry-body-calls-tax-hikes-draconian/articleshow/122406782.cms,"More than 20,000 bars and permit rooms across Maharashtra will observe a one-day bandh on July 14 to protest what the hospitality sector has called “draconian” tax hikes by the state government, the Indian Hotel and Restaurant Association (AHAR) said on Saturday.The association said the shutdown is aimed at opposing multiple tax increases imposed over the past year — including a 10% VAT on liquor, a 15% hike in annual licence fees, and a 60% surge in excise duty — which it claims are threatening the survival of the Rs 1.5 lakh-crore industry, PTI reported.“The entire hospitality sector in Maharashtra is bleeding. Our pleas have fallen on deaf ears. On July 14, every bar and permit room in the state will be shut in protest,” AHAR president Sudhakar Shetty said in a statement. He added that members from Mumbai, Pune, Nashik, Nagpur, and Konkan have confirmed participation.AHAR warned that the aggressive taxation regime, coupled with post-COVID recovery challenges, is making the business model unsustainable for thousands of establishments. “This is not just an economic blow, it is a death blow to an industry that contributes significantly to employment and state taxes,” said Shetty.The permit room and bar segment, which supports over 20 lakh jobs both directly and indirectly, also sustains a wider network of nearly 48,000 vendors across Maharashtra.The industry fears the hike in liquor-related levies could lead to mass unemployment and a spike in black-market alcohol smuggling from neighbouring states, further weakening state revenues.Several major industry bodies, including the National Restaurant Association of India (NRAI) and Hotel and Restaurant Association (Western India) – HRAWI, along with various affiliated and unaffiliated hotel and restaurant associations across the state, have extended support to the bandh.“We stand united with our fraternity members across Maharashtra in expressing our deep concern over these regressive policy measures. If implemented, they will further strain the already fragile business environment and hurt both consumers and operators,” said HRAWI president Jimmy Shaw.AHAR urged the Maharashtra government to roll back the tax increases and initiate discussions with stakeholders to avoid long-term damage to one of the state’s key employment-generating and tourism-supporting sectors.","More than 20,000 bars and permit rooms across Maharashtra will observe a one-day bandh on July 14.

‘Sooner or later…’: Paytm founder sees impact of AI on jobs as ‘inevitable’; says artificial intelligence will also create new roles,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sooner-or-later-paytm-founder-sees-impact-of-ai-on-jobs-as-inevitable-says-artificial-intelligence-will-also-create-new-roles/articleshow/122409161.cms,"The impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on jobs is ""inevitable"", according to Paytm founder Vijay Shekhar Sharma, who said AI will become part of routine business processes sooner rather than later. “Sooner or later we will have to start using AI as an employee or even as a CFO,” Sharma said at an AI-focused event in New Delhi.He said AI will eventually perform most tasks currently done by humans, and stressed the need to build core products instead. Sharma also outlined a broader vision for the company — to move beyond its fintech roots and become an AI-first firm, according to an ET report.Although AI will automate several human functions, Sharma said it will also create fresh roles in the workforce.The remarks come at a time when Paytm’s parent, One97 Communications, is undergoing job cuts. ET reported last month that the company had laid off an unspecified number of employees. The overall sales team headcount dropped by about 3,500 in the March 2024 quarter, taking the total to 36,521.

Here are 10 recent developments in the India-US trade deal talks that you should know about:

1) Less than 20% tariff?

2) India officials in US Soon

3) Donald Trump on a tariff letter spree - but no letter for India so far

4) Trump says deal with India soon

5) India not working on deadlines

6) India’s trade deal issues

8) Trump's BRICS tariff threat

9) Only an interim trade deal for now

10) India-US WTO tiff

India-US trade deal: In February this year, US President Donald Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the intent for a trade deal by fall this year. Come April 2025, and Trump announced reciprocal tariffs on a lot of countries, India being one of them.The American President soon suspended his tariffs for a 90-day period giving countries time to strike a trade deal with the US. That deadline of July 9 has now been extended to August 1.A trade deal between India and the US has still not been finalized. Though, there are indications that an interim agreement may be announced soon. Trump’s tariff war has changed the global economic landscape and progress on a trade deal between the world’s largest economy (US) and the soon to be fourth largest (India) is being tracked by experts world over.The United States is negotiating an interim trade agreement with India, aiming to lower proposed tariffs to under 20%, sources with knowledge of the discussions have told Bloomberg. This would give India a competitive advantage over other countries in the region.The preliminary agreement is expected to establish a base tariff rate lower than 20%, in contrast to the 26% that was initially suggested, the report said.Meanwhile, a delegation from India's commerce ministry is scheduled to travel to Washington for fresh negotiations with the US, a government official told PTI earlier this week. The discussions will be both for an interim trade deal and the first part of the bilateral trade agreement. The delegation is likely to arrive in Washington next week, the report said.Last month an Indian delegation, headed by chief negotiator Rajesh Agrawal, were in Washington for discussions.Also Read | ‘Unnecessary trade barriers…’: US hits out at India’s dairy certificate requirements at WTO; raises issue amidst trade deal talks Donald Trump has been on a tariff letter sending spree this week. While the effective date for the reciprocal tariffs has been revised to August 1 from July 9, Trump has intimated over 20 countries of the tariff rates that will be applicable on their exports to the US.India has not been sent any such letter till now. According to a Bloomberg report, India expects a trade deal announcement soon instead of a tariff demand letter. Any interim trade deal announcement would give both India and the US time to negotiate on the final trade that is expected by fall.Earlier this week, Trump announced that America was nearing a trade agreement with India. ""We've spoken to everybody. ...it's all done. I told you we'll make some deals, but for the most part, we're going to send a letter. We're going to say, welcome to the United States if you'd like to participate in the greatest, most successful country ever. I mean we are doing better than ever... We've never had numbers like this. We've never had investment like this. We have more than 90... have much more than 90. But most of those are going to be sent to letter. This is exactly what I said.

When the deal is made while safeguarding India's interests, keeping in mind that national interest will always remain paramount, then India is always ready to make deals with developed countries,” he added.India has maintained a strong position on providing duty concessions to the US for agricultural and dairy products, given their sensitive status. India's policy has consistently protected its dairy sector across all previous trade arrangements.Additionally, India continues to uphold its ban on genetically modified food crops, which contrasts with the United States' agricultural practices, where GM varieties dominate corn and soybean cultivation.Unresolved matters persist regarding duties on steel, aluminium (50 per cent) and auto (25 per cent).

""Any Country aligning themselves with the Anti-American policies of BRICS, will be charged an ADDITIONAL 10% Tariff. There will be no exceptions to this policy.

If a trade deal is announced before the August 1 deadline of Trump, it is likely only to be a mini or interim trade deal.

The US has voiced fresh objections at the WTO, stating that India's dairy certification criteria create unnecessary barriers for dairy exports from America.The trade disputes between India and the US at the WTO extend beyond dairy matters. India has spoken of retaliatory tariffs against the United States, in accordance with WTO protocols, following American duties on steel and aluminium that were enacted as 'safeguard measures'.Additionally, India has recently signalled its plans to introduce countermeasures in response to US tariffs on automotive products.However, a government official told PTI that India's move to maintain its right for imposing reciprocal duties on the US regarding auto parts tariffs is a standard protocol under World Trade Organisation's safeguard provisions. This will not create any hindrance to the current trade agreement discussions between both nations.",A trade deal between India and the US has still not been finalized.

Mexico tariffs : 'Not enough' done to stop cartels

EU tariffs: ‘Far from reciprocal’

Trump's 'no tariff' conditions

US President Donald Trump announced on Saturday that starting August 1, 2025, goods imported from both Mexico and the European Union will be subject to a 30% tariff.The letters, posted on his social media platform, cite drug trafficking concerns in Mexico and long-standing trade imbalances with the EU as reasons for the sweeping measures.Days earlier, Trump had intensified global trade tensions by issuing tariff warning letters to over 20 nations, cautioning that elevated import duties will come into effect from August 1, 2025, unless new bilateral trade agreements are secured.These nations included Japan, South Korea, and South Africa of potential tariffs ranging between 25% and 40%. Later he expanded the list by sending letters to eight additional countries, announcing new tariff rates: Brazil (50%), the Philippines (20%), Brunei (25%), Moldova (25%), Algeria (30%), Libya (30%), Iraq (30%), and Sri Lanka (30%).Addressing Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, Trump said the United States could no longer ignore Mexico’s failure to fully stop the flow of fentanyl and other narcotics into the country. While acknowledging that while it had been helping “secure the border,” he insisted, “what Mexico has done is not enough.”“Mexico still has not stopped the Cartels who are trying to turn all of North America into a Narco-Trafficking Playground.Obviously, I cannot let that happen!” Trump wrote.As a result from August 1, all Mexican goods entering the US will face a 30% tariff, in addition to any existing sector-specific levies. Trump also warned against efforts to bypass the tariff system through transshipment, noting that such goods would “be subject to that higher Tariff.”Trump also hinted at broader frustrations, writing, “The flow of Fentanyl is hardly the only challenge we have with Mexico, which has many Tariff, and Non-Tariff, Policies and Trade Barriers, which cause unsustainable Trade Deficits against the United States.”In the letter to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, Trump expressed frustration over persistent trade deficits with the EU. “Our relationship has been, unfortunately, far from Reciprocal,” he wrote, accusing the bloc of long-standing protectionist policies.""We have had years to discuss our Trading Relationship with The European Union, and have concluded that we must move away from these long-term, large, and persistent, Trade Deficits, engendered by your Tariff, and Non- Tariff, Policies and Trade Barriers.""From August 1, a 30% tariff will apply to all EU products entering the US, separate from other sector-specific tariffs. Trump noted that while the new rate is “far less than what is needed” to close the trade gap, it is a first step toward “balanced and fair TRADE.”He also cautioned against retaliation, “If for any reason you decide to raise your Tariffs and retaliate, then, whatever the number you choose to raise them by, will be added onto the 30% that we charge.”He said that the 30% figure is still lower than what is required to “eliminate the Trade Deficit disparity we have with the EU.”In both letters, Trump framed the tariffs as a correction of economic “injustices” that pose “a major threat to our Economy and, indeed, our National Security.”In the letters, Trump also mentioned that there “will be no tariff” in case the EU and Mexico or the companies within decide to manufacture in the US, assuring that the country will assist in getting quick approvals for the same.He wrote, that in case there is a decision “to build or manufacture product within the United States and, in fact, we will do everything possible to get approvals quickly, professionally, and routinely-In other words, in a matter of weeks.”","US President Donald Trump announced on Saturday that starting August 1, 2025, goods imported from both Mexico and the European Union will be subject to a 30% tariff.

Mexico 'did not agree'

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and Mexican officials have both hit back at US President Donald Trump's latest threat to impose 30% tariffs on their exports starting August 1.While the European Union has reiterated its commitment to negotiations, Mexico has rejected the move outright, calling it “unfair” and unacceptable.Trump made the announcement via his Truth Social platform, on Saturday, citing a trade imbalance with the EU and Mexico’s alleged role in the flow of illicit drugs into the US.European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen sharply criticised the proposed US tariffs, warning they would “disrupt essential transatlantic supply chains, to the detriment of businesses, consumers and patients on both sides of the Atlantic.” She reaffirmed the EU’s preference for a negotiated settlement, saying, “We remain ready to continue working towards an agreement by August 1.”However, von der Leyen made it clear that the bloc would not back down if talks failed. “We will take all necessary steps to safeguard EU interests, including the adoption of proportionate countermeasures if required,” she said, adding that the EU’s trading practices remain among the most open and fair globally.""The EU has consistently prioritized a negotiated solution with the US, reflecting our commitment to dialogue, stability, and a constructive transatlantic partnership,"" she said.Brussels has already drawn up a retaliatory tariff package worth €21 billion, which remains suspended until July 14.An EU spokeswoman confirmed that the bloc had been notified of the new tariff plan ahead of Trump’s public announcement. In response to the rising tension, EU diplomats have convened an emergency meeting in Brussels on Sunday to assess next steps.Mexico, too, pushed back strongly against Trump’s new tariff warning. In a joint statement from its economy and foreign ministries, the Mexican government labelled the move an “unfair deal,” following discussions with US officials on Friday.“We mentioned at the table that it was an unfair deal and that we did not agree,” the statement read.Despite the rising tensions, both Mexico and the EU have indicated a willingness to keep the door open for further dialogue. However, with just weeks remaining until the August 1 deadline, the risk of a new global trade conflict is looming.","US President Donald Trump has threatened to impose 30% tariffs on EU exports starting August 1.

Critical minerals push: India to make rare earth magnets in Hyderabad; G Kishan Reddy says move to cut China reliance,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/critical-minerals-push-india-to-make-rare-earth-magnets-in-hyderabad-g-kishan-reddy-says-move-to-cut-china-reliance/articleshow/122404691.cms,"India will begin domestic production of rare earth magnets in Hyderabad in a bid to reduce reliance on Chinese imports and strengthen its position in critical technology manufacturing, Union Coal and Mines minister G Kishan Reddy said on Saturday.Speaking to ANI, Reddy said the Centre has tasked the National Institute for Transforming Science and Materials (NFTSM), under the Ministry of Mines, with driving this initiative in partnership with industry players. “The central government has decided to produce rare earth magnets in Hyderabad. Our Mining Ministry’s NFTSM institute is working diligently, along with various industries, to manufacture the necessary machinery,” he said.Reddy added that a demonstration of India’s indigenous capabilities in manufacturing permanent magnets would be ready within the next 3-4 months. “This initiative involves collaboration between industry, mining, and other ministries, and has been discussed with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The Central Government is working seriously towards the production of rare earth magnets,” he said.The move comes in response to China's decision earlier this year to restrict exports of certain rare earth materials.“We were 100% dependent on China for rare earth permanent magnets, but recently China denied supplying to us,” the minister said.In April 2024, China imposed export controls on a list of rare earth-related items, triggering supply disruptions globally and prompting countries like India to fast-track domestic production plans.Industry bodies have welcomed the government's efforts. Pankaj Mohindroo, Chairman of the India Cellular and Electronics Association (ICEA), praised the initiative, particularly the incentives being considered to support magnet manufacturing.The push to develop rare earth capabilities falls under the broader Critical Mineral Mission announced by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in the 2024-25 Union Budget. In January 2025, the Cabinet approved the launch of the National Critical Mineral Mission (NCMM), with a budgeted expenditure of Rs 16,300 crore and an expected investment of Rs 18,000 crore by public sector undertakings.Rare earth magnets are key components in a range of high-tech applications including electric vehicles , mobile phones, wind turbines, and defence systems.","The move comes in response to China's decision earlier this year to restrict exports of certain rare earth materials.

Meme coins like Pudgy, Dogecoin, and Useless are lighting up trader dashboards again with short-term pumps and viral buzz. But behind the memes, a deeper conversation is emerging.Some investors are now looking beyond the hype for projects with real-world use and long-term staying power. One serious contender is starting to dominate that conversation offering something meme coins simply can’t, which is actual utility and 100x potential.Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) may have started as a feel-good meme coin, but traders are now watching it with mixed emotions. The token slid 7.21% in the last 24 hours to $0.01515, with trading volume also down 21%.Despite this dip, its market cap remains just shy of $1 billion, hinting that interest hasn’t fully faded. On the weekly chart, PENGU still clings to its broader uptrend but barely. Some analysts say it’s now at a technical crossroads, where either renewed meme momentum kicks in or short-term holders begin to rotate out.With speculation swirling around the next 100x play, some traders are starting to question if tokens like Pudgy can hold ground against more grounded, utility-first projects.Dogecoin is making noise again with a 6.6% jump, lifting it to $0.1743 and pushing daily trading volume past $1.2 billion. Whale activity and retail momentum appear to be fueling this short-term breakout, but DOGE is still stuck inside a long-running descending wedge.Despite the rally, its multi-year support at $0.13 remains the true backbone of its price structure. Meme traders may love the action, but real growth lies elsewhere.Useless Coin has taken irony to the bank. Up over 77% this week and nearly 250% in the past month, it’s turned “no utility” into a rallying cry. Priced near $0.29 with a $300 million market cap, the coin continues to ride a wave of memes, momentum and mischief.Traders clearly aren’t betting on fundamentals here; they're leaning into the joke. With strong volume and a chart full of higher highs, USELESS could nudge past $0.30 if the hype holds.Still, it walks a tightrope. Without any real-world use case or innovation, this is a vibes-only coin. And while the irony sells now, some investors are already scanning for the next big project with actual firepower, like Remittix.While Pudgy, Dogecoin and Useless dominate meme coin chatter, a very different kind of project is gaining momentum beneath the surface.

Official figures released on Friday showed that gross domestic product (GDP) declined 0.1% in May, following a 0.3% drop in April.The latest reading came as a surprise to economists polled by Reuters, who had expected a 0.1% increase in GDP. While the services sector managed a marginal gain, declines in industrial output and construction dragged overall growth into negative territory, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said.The data casts doubt on whether the economy expanded in the second quarter of 2025, and has strengthened expectations that the Bank of England (BoE) will cut interest rates next month. “The lack of momentum in the UK economy indicated by these sluggish figures means that an August interest rate cut currently looks inevitable, despite the recent spike in inflation,” said Suren Thiru, economics director at accountancy body ICAEW.Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s Labour government, which took office earlier this year, has yet to deliver a meaningful boost to growth. Economists say finance minister Reeves may now be forced to consider tax hikes in her next budget, despite earlier hopes to avoid them.“While today’s figures are disappointing, I am determined to kickstart economic growth and deliver on that promise,” Reeves said in response to the ONS release.Britain had posted a strong performance in the first quarter of 2025, outpacing other G7 economies. In May, the BoE raised its full-year growth forecast to 1%. However, much of the Q1 surge was attributed to temporary factors — including a rush to close home purchases before the expiry of a tax break in April and accelerated exports to beat rising US tariffs.The BoE estimates second-quarter GDP growth at around 0.25%. To meet that target, the ONS said, June would need to show at least flat monthly growth, assuming no revisions to previous months. A contraction of 0.4% or more in June would result in a quarterly decline.“The second straight decline in monthly real GDP in May will increase concerns that the government’s growth plan has been derailed by external and domestic shocks,” said Raj Badiani, economics director for Europe at S&P Global Market Intelligence, quoted Reuters.","Britain's economy contracted for the second consecutive month in May.

Slow US-China trade deal may push Trump's tariff deadlines; rare earth metal supplies may face disruption: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/slow-us-china-trade-deal-may-push-trumps-tariff-deadlines-rare-earth-metal-supplies-may-face-disruption-report/articleshow/122384882.cms,"Slow US-China trade deal may push Trump's tariff deadlines

Trade deals between the US and China are moving at a pace slower than expected, which may lead to extensions of the current tariff deadlines, according to a report by SBI Funds Management.The report highlighted deadlock amidst ongoing trade talks between both the nations with both sides showing limited progress in finalising a deal. The report points at a critical standby in global supply of rare earth metals which may get affected owing to China’s domination in supplying 90% of the global capacity, reported ANI.China’s dominance over rare earth metals could prove detrimental for global automobile industry, especially electric vehicle production in the US, Europe, and India.China on Tuesday responded to Trump administration’s renewed tariff plans with warning of potential retaliatory measures.Beijing also indicated that it may also take action against countries that align with Washington's efforts to marginalize China within global supply chains. The warning was published as a part of an official commentary in People’s Daily. The article called the US tariff strategy, labeling it “bullying,” and argued that “dialogue and cooperation are the only correct path”, reported by Reuters.The 90-day pause for trade negotiations which was initially set to end on July 9, has been extended to August 1. Trump has escalated trade tensions by sending tariff letters to more than 20 countries, warning that higher import duties will take effect from August 1, 2025 if bilateral trade deals are not reached.","Trade deals between the US and China are moving at a pace slower than expected, which may lead to extensions of the current tariff deadlines.

How companies are reacting to tariffs and what it means for consumer prices

President Donald Trump has sharply expanded a barrage of tariffs since returning to office, aiming to overhaul global trade in favour of the United States. The sweeping measures, which target a broad range of foreign goods and industries, have triggered market fluctuations and strained ties with key American allies.In his latest announcement, Trump said Canada would face a 35% tariff on many goods, citing the country’s alleged role in enabling fentanyl trafficking into the US. The move came just a day after he imposed a sweeping 50% tariff on all imports from Brazil.Trump claimed the Brazil tariff was partly a response to the ongoing trial of his political ally, former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, who faces charges related to a failed coup attempt. Reacting strongly, Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva vowed retaliation, stating that Brazil ""will not accept being abused by anyone.""Trump also plans to impose a 50% tariff on all copper imports starting August 1, citing national security concerns. The decision could raise costs for US industries reliant on the metal, especially manufacturing and construction.Trump has escalated trade tensions by sending tariff letters to more than 20 countries, warning that higher import duties will take effect from August 1, 2025 if bilateral trade deals are not reached.The move marks a continuation of his aggressive ""reciprocal tariff"" policy first announced in April this year. The letters outline specific tariff rates, some adjusted from earlier levels.Many of the new tariff rates echo those Trump proposed in April, before temporarily suspending them, except for China, to give nations time to negotiate trade deals, according to The New York Times.So far, two countries have managed to reach agreements with the US. A deal with the UK will lower tariffs on cars, steel, and aerospace parts. Another agreement with Vietnam sets a 20% tariff on general imports and a 40% duty on transshipped goods, lower than the initially planned 46%.Meanwhile, representatives from Japan, the EU, Malaysia, South Korea, Indonesia, and others have been meeting US officials to avoid the looming hikes.India is also stepping up talks. A commerce ministry team is expected to visit Washington next week for another round of discussions over the proposed bilateral trade agreement.While exact dates are yet to be confirmed, officials say the focus will be on finalising both interim and phase-one parts of the deal ahead of the tariff deadline, according to sources quoted by PTI.In June, the US doubled tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum to 50%. Trump said the move was aimed at countering countries that ""undercut the competitiveness"" of American industries.While intended to protect domestic producers, the higher tariffs are likely to increase costs for US companies that depend on these metals, such as automakers, construction firms, and oil drillers. Consumers may also see higher prices on goods like canned foods.All cars assembled outside the US and all imported auto parts now face a 25% duty. Trump claims the tariffs will boost investment and create jobs in the US, but analysts warn they could significantly raise new car prices and repair costs for consumers.In May, Trump closed the “de minimis” rule, which had allowed retailers to ship goods from abroad—especially China—directly to US buyers without paying tariffs (for packages under $800).The rule helped e-commerce platforms like Shein and Temu flourish, but made it hard for US producers to compete. The closure is expected to slow down cheap imports but may also lead to higher prices for online shoppers.He has also issued a warning to the BRICS nations (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa), threatening an additional 10% tariff on ""any Country aligning themselves with the Anti-American policies of BRICS.""The European Union is also on Trump’s radar. He claimed the EU was ""formed to screw the US"" and threatened a 50% tariff if trade terms aren’t renegotiated.Trump believes the US trade deficit—when America imports more than it exports—is a sign of economic failure. He sees tariffs as a way to punish countries for ""ripping off"" the US and to bring back jobs and manufacturing.His administration claims that by making imports more expensive, companies will be forced to produce goods domestically, boosting employment and wages.But Trump also uses tariffs as leverage—to push countries into trade deals, extract concessions, or generate revenue that can be used for domestic programs like tax cuts.Experts argue that Trump’s tariff goals are conflicting. While he wants to boost US manufacturing, the higher costs of imported materials like steel and semiconductors can actually hurt American producers by raising their production costs and disrupting supply chains.A tariff is a tax that the government charges on goods brought in from other countries. In the US , these tariffs are paid by American importers—not foreign exporters—and the money collected goes directly to the US Treasury.For example, if Walmart imports shoes worth $100 from Myanmar, which now faces a 40% tariff, the company must pay $40 to the government, The New York Times reported.Walmart’s CEO recently warned that rising tariffs would likely lead to price hikes, prompting former President Trump to publicly urge the company to “eat the tariffs” and avoid raising prices.The ripple effects of tariffs are being felt across supply chains. With the US heavily reliant on Chinese factories for products like toys and Christmas decorations, many businesses have begun pausing holiday orders. Toymaker Mattel has already announced it will raise prices on US toys in response to tariffs on Chinese imports.While tariffs are known to drive up consumer prices, major inflation indicators like the Consumer Price Index have yet to reflect a sharp increase.Economists suggest it's only a matter of time. Many companies stocked up on inventory ahead of tariff hikes, helping delay price increases, but as those supplies run out, consumers may soon see the difference at checkout.","President Donald Trump has sharply expanded a barrage of tariffs since returning to office.

'Closer': Donald Trump's Big Hint On India-US Trade Deal Amid High Tariff Slapped On Other Nations

NEW DELHI: Further talks on the India-US trade deal are lined up in the coming days with negotiators once again headed to Washington as the government seeks to finalise an agreement, without any deadline pressure.""We are not differentiating between an interim or the first phase of the bilateral trade agreement. We are negotiating a complete deal. Whatever will be finalised, we can package it as an interim deal, and for the rest, talks will continue,"" said an official, days after President Donald Trump announced that US was ""close to making a deal with India"".Earlier this year, Trump and PM Modi had set a deadline for finalising a trade deal by September-October but with reciprocal tariffs announced, an interim tranche or a mini deal entered the picture. While Trump has been sending letters to countries setting revised reciprocal tariffs effective Aug 1, India is so far not on the list.But month-end is seen as the latest deadline to offer concessions in areas of interest to the US. In India's case, it is agriculture that is of prime interest, along with American whiskey and automobiles, but the government is reluctant to lower tariffs on farm goods. Besides, commerce minister Piyush Goyal has said that the government will not be bound by deadlines and will ensure that India's interest remains paramount.On Monday, Rajesh Agarwal, India’s chief negotiator for the US trade deal, said the government is trying to negotiate and finalise a trade agreement.Having implemented 14 free trade agreements with 26 countries, he said, “Now, we are integrating with major markets also... we just concluded an agreement with the UK, we are in an advanced stage of negotiations with the European Union, we are trying to negotiate and finalise a deal with the US...”“This will create huge opportunities for India also to become part of global value chains,” he said here at an event on export logistics. Agarwal also listed New Zealand, Chile and Peru among countries with which talks were under way.“Our tariffs will be bilaterally cut... People will be able to make long-term investment decisions based on this predictability of tariff and regulatory landscape... In this logistics will also be a major determinant,” he had said. Besides, he had underlined that the government was working towards lowering logistics costs.","Talks on the India-US trade deal are lined up in the coming days.

Housing squeeze: 30-year US mortgage rate rises to 6.72%; 5-week easing streak ends as borrowing costs inch up,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/housing-squeeze-30-year-us-mortgage-rate-rises-to-6-72-5-week-easing-streak-ends-as-borrowing-costs-inch-up/articleshow/122371064.cms,"T he average long-term mortgage rate in the US edged higher this week, ending a five-week streak of easing borrowing costs that had offered some relief to prospective homebuyers.According to mortgage buyer Freddie Mac, the average rate on a 30-year home loan ticked up to 6.72% from 6.67% last week. A year ago, the rate was higher at 6.89%, AP reported.The increase also extended to 15-year fixed-rate mortgages, often used for refinancing. The average rose to 5.86% from 5.80% a week earlier, compared to 6.17% at this time last year, Freddie Mac said on Thursday.Persistently high borrowing costs have continued to weigh on the housing market, which has been in a sales slump since 2022. “Mortgage rates may come down modestly over the coming months,” said Lisa Sturtevant, chief economist at Bright MLS, “but other economic headwinds — including the impact of tariffs on consumer goods, weaker labour market conditions and rising consumer debt — could be what continue to hold the housing market in the second half of 2025. ”Despite the recent dip in rates, home prices remain elevated, which has discouraged many buyers.Sales of previously occupied homes last year fell to their lowest in nearly three decades and have remained subdued so far in 2025.Mortgage rates are primarily influenced by movements in the 10-year Treasury yield, which lenders use to price home loans. The yield rose to 4.37% by midday Thursday, up from 4.34% a day earlier. Yields climbed last week after a stronger-than-expected jobs report led traders to bet that the Federal Reserve may keep interest rates on hold.The 30-year mortgage rate has hovered near its 2025 peak of just over 7%, set in January. It briefly dipped to a low of 6.62% in April.Recent easing in rates helped drive a 9.4% jump in mortgage applications last week, according to data from the Mortgage Bankers Association. But economists broadly expect rates to remain in the 6% to 7% range for the rest of the year.","The average rate on a 30-year home loan ticked up to 6.72% from 6.67% last week.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.","Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor ( CEA ) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas.

How India's GDP has been growing

What SBI report said on savings and investment

Incremental capital output ratio

NEW DELHI: India's gross domestic product (GDP) data for the third quarter (October-December 2022) received a word of caution from the former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan In an interview with news agency PTI, Rajan that India is ""dangerously close"" to the Hindu rate of growth in view of subdued private sector investment, high interest rates and slowing global growth.India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying"".However, a report released by the State Bank of India (SBI) economists on Tuesday dismissed arguments that India is dangerously close to Hindu rate of growth saying such statements are ""ill-conceived, biased and premature"".The term 'Hindu growth rate' was coined by late economist Raj Krishna in 1978 to describe the slow growth in the country.It basically refers to the low pace of economic growth rates during 1950s to 1980s. During this period, the Indian economy averaged 3.5%.A former lecturer at the Delhi School of Economics (DSE), Krishna noted that only if the rate of growth is persistently slow and accompanied by low per-capita GDP, then it will be known as Hindu rate of growth but it has to factor in population growth as well.Before economic reforms of 1991, India's economic growth remained stagnant and low, while per capita income averaged around 1.3%. Krishna termed this low growth situation to be a result of socialist policies of state control and import substitution.However, the economic situation changed when liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation (LPG) reforms came into effect in the year 1991, at a time when India faced balance of payment crisis.Over the years, many economists have strongly opposed the idea of 'Hindu growth rate' and the term never had universal acceptance.The Indian economy plunged into its very first technical recession in FY21 due to the impact of Covid-19 pandemic and the related nationwide lockdowns. GDP shrunk by an unprecedented 23.8% in the first quarter of the financial year 2020-21. However, due to spurt in economic activities in the subsequent quarters, the GDP decline started to narrow.However, if we look at the period before Covid-19 as well, India's growth curve shows a declining trend.From 8.26% in FY17, GDP growth plunged to 3.74% in FY20. Shutdown of economic activities in FY21 in wake of Covid-19 only made matters worse.As lockdowns started to ease and business activities resumed, India's GDP also started rising. In Q1 of FY22, growth jumped to 20.1% mainly on account of low base effect. By the fourth quarter of FY22, growth came down to 4.10%.Similarly, the new financial year 2022-23 brought fresh economic challenges in the form of Russia-Ukraine war that impacted almost all major economies of the world, slowed the pace of growth, pushed inflation to record highs.As a result, the central banks of all advanced economies spurred into action and opted for monetary policy tightening to curb the soaring inflation.With persistently rising interest rates, India's economy grew by 4.4% in Q3 of FY23, as the Centre revised upwards GDP growth for previous year to 9.10% from 8.7% earlier.The report weighed recent GDP numbers against the available data on savings and investments for the past decade and highlighted some interesting points.""Quarterly growth numbers are noisy and should be best avoided for any serious interpretation (on an average, India's GDP growth has witnessed Rs 2 lakh crore upward revision for the 3 year ended FY23),"" the report said.Gross capital formation (GCF) by the government touched a high of 11.8% in 2021-22, up from 10.7% in 2020-21.""This also had a domino effect on private sector investment that jumped from 10 per cent to 10.8% over the same period,"" it said.In fact, Ecowrap added that the trends in GCF to gross output ratio or the plough back of funds for creation of fresh capacity shows that for public administration the ratio attained fresh peak in 2021-22 owing to the emphasis on capital expenditure in recent budgets.At the aggregate level, gross capital formation is supposed to have crossed 32% in 2022-23, the highest level since 2018-19.According to the report, in 2021-22, gross savings have risen to 30% from 29% in 2020-21.""The ratio is supposed to have crossed 31 per cent in 2022-23, the highest since 2018-19. The household savings increased sharply during the pandemic period on account of sharp accretion in financial savings such as deposits,"" said the report by SBI's Economic Research Department.While household financial savings have since then moderated from 15.4% in 2020-21 to 11.1% in 2022-23, savings in physical assets have grown sharply to 11.8% in 2021-22 from 10.7% in 2020-21.The report further analysed Incremental Capital Output ratio (ICOR) -- which measures additional units of capital (investment) needed to produce additional units of output. It said that the ratio has been improving.""ICOR which was 7.5 in FY 12 is now only 3.5 in FY22. Clearly, only half of capital is now needed for next unit of output,"" the report noted.Such reducing ICOR in the current years reflects a relatively increasing efficiency of capital and shows that the economy is on a sound footing, the report said.""From that point of view, future GDP growth rates even at 7% could still mean a decent number by any standards!,"" it added.","India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%. Raghuram Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying""","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-98483158,imgsize-65724,width-400,resizemode-4/98483158.jpg"

An employee is entitled for a 50 per cent amount of the last drawn salary as pension.OPS was discontinued by the NDA government in 2003 with effect from April 1, 2004.Under the new pension scheme (NPS), employees contribute 10 per cent of their basic salary towards pension while the government contributes 14 per cent.Governments of Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand have informed the central government/ Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority ( PFRDA about their decision to restart OPS for their employees.The government of Punjab on November 18, 2022, issued a notification regarding implementation of OPS for the state government employees who are being covered under NPS. Jharkhand too has decided to revert to OPS.",Former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan has expressed his concern over the decision of some states to restart the old pension scheme.

Stock market recommendations:

According to Bajaj Broking Research, the top stock picks for November 7, 2025 are Manappuram Finance, and Dabur India. Here’s its view on Nifty and Bank Nifty:

Index View: NIFTY

The recent breakout region, which previously acted as a resistance and now is likely to provide support.

The 50% Fibonacci retracement of the preceding upswing from 24,587 to 26,104, indicating a potential mean-reversion zone.

The 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), currently placed near the 25,325 mark, further reinforcing the area’s significance as a near-term floor for the index.

NIFTY BANK

Bank Nifty continues to consolidate in a range for the third week in a row after hitting an all-time high of 58577.

Going ahead, index to extend consolidation of the last two weeks in the range of 57300-58500 thus forming base after the next leg of up move.

A close below 57300 will open downside towards the key support area of 56,800–56,500. On the higher key resistance is placed at recent all time high of 58,577. A move above the same will open further upside towards 59,000 being the 138.2% Fibonacci projection of the recent correction (57,628–53,561).

Overall, the outlook remains positive, and current pullbacks should be viewed as buying opportunities within these support areas. PSU Banking stocks to extend the recent outperformance

Benchmark indices extended its corrective consolidation for the third week in a row. Investors stayed on the sidelines, tracking developments on US–China and US–India trade negotiations. India’s economic fundamentals stayed strong, supported by a robust manufacturing & service PMI and steady GST collections, indicating healthy growth momentum in the economy.Over the past ten trading sessions, the Nifty has undergone a corrective retracement of approximately 600 points, effectively unwinding the overbought readings that had emerged on the daily stochastic oscillator following a sharp 1,500-point rally over the preceding four weeks. This measured pullback should be viewed as a healthy consolidation within the broader uptrend rather than the onset of a major reversal. We recommend utilizing this phase as an opportunity to accumulate quality large-cap and sectoral leaders in a staggered manner, keeping a short- to medium-term investment horizon.Technically, the index is now approaching a crucial demand zone between 25,500 and 25,300, which is expected to act as a strong support base. This zone coincides with multiple technical confluences:From a price structure perspective, the medium-term trend remains constructive as long as the index sustains above this pivotal support band.A decisive formation of a higher high and higher low will signal a pause in the current decline and open pullback towards immediate resistance of 25,850. Beyond this, the 26,100 level, which represents the twin highs of the past two weeks, would serve as the next key resistance and potential trigger for a renewed leg higher.The stock remains in steady up trend forming higher high and higher low in the long-term chart. The entire up move of CY25 is well channelled signaling sustained demand at elevated levels.The stock has strong support at 260-258 levels being the confluence of the key retracement and 144 days EMA.We expect the stock to head towards the recent all time high placed at 298 in the coming month.The stock has witnessed a steady pullback post its quarterly numbers and is currently placed above its short- and medium-term averages.We expect the stock to extend its current pullback and head towards 567 levels in the coming month being the trendline resistance joining recent highs.Immediate support is placed at 500-490 levels being the confluence of key retracement and trendline support joining recent lows. The daily 14 periods RSI is in buy mode thus supports the positive bias.","According to Bajaj Broking Research, the top stock picks for November 7, 2025 are Manappuram Finance, and Dabur India.

The upper band around ₹1,21,800 is expected to act as immediate resistance.Gold’s intraday setup is turning constructive as the EMAs converge positively, RSI rebounds, and MACD signals a shift in momentum. The broader structure favors buying on dips near ₹1,20,600 with defined risk at ₹1,20,100, aiming for an upside towards ₹1,21,800.

Elon Musk Becomes First Man To Have $500 Billion Wealth

How Musk could receive the $1 trillion









Tesla shareholders on Thursday approved Elon Musk’s multibillion-dollar pay package, giving the CEO a pathway to earn as much as $1 trillion if he delivers on a set of long-term performance targets. More than 75% of shareholders backed the plan at Thursday’s meeting, and the announcement was met with cheers.""What we're about to embark upon is not merely a new chapter of the future of Tesla, but a whole new book,"" Musk told the audience when he took the stage.The package is designed to keep Musk at Tesla long enough to pursue the technological goals he has set for the company. Musk has said Tesla’s progress in areas such as artificial intelligence, self-driving technology and robotics will put it ahead of competitors. If Musk meets all the targets in the plan, he could become the world’s first trillionaire.Musk currently has a net worth of more than $500 billion and is listed as the world’s richest person on Forbes’ real-time billionaire rankings. Under the approved plan, he must meet various milestones linked to Tesla’s market value to receive the full package. The first part becomes available when Tesla reaches a $2 trillion market value.The package also includes goals tied to operating profit and product launches, such as delivering 20 million Tesla vehicles. The plan is structured to keep Musk at Tesla for at least seven and a half years.Musk has said Tesla’s growth potential is significant, stating in July that ""Tesla will be the most valuable company in the world by far"" if the company meets its goals for autonomous driving and artificial intelligence.Musk will only receive the payout if he achieves the required operational and financial goals.The targets include delivering 20 million vehicles within 10 years. This is more than twice the number Tesla has produced in the past 12 years. He must also increase the company’s market value and operating profits, and oversee the delivery of one million robots. Tesla has not delivered any robots yet.Even if Musk does not reach every goal, he could still receive a large payout. He will get $50 billion in Tesla shares if he raises the company’s market value by 80%, doubles vehicle sales and triples operating profit — or meets any two of the other operational targets.","More than 75% of shareholders backed the plan at Thursday’s meeting.

Local businesses see sales fall, jobs vanish

Families under pressure as aid stalls





Washington’s economy is facing deepening distress as the longest-ever US government shutdown, mass layoffs of federal workers, and cuts to food assistance converge to hit households and small businesses across the capital region, AP reported.The Capital Area Food Bank, which supports more than 400 pantries and aid organisations across the District of Columbia, northern Virginia, and two Maryland counties, is preparing to provide 8 million more meals than planned this year — a nearly 20% increase.“This city has been hit especially hard because of the sequence of events that has occurred over the course of this year,” said Radha Muthiah, CEO and president of the food bank.The nation’s capital, home to roughly 150,000 federal employees, has been reeling from layoffs, the shutdown, and heightened law enforcement deployment. With the shutdown halting pay for hundreds of thousands of workers and freezing federal food aid, the economic strain has intensified.The District’s unemployment rate stood at 6% in September, one of the highest in the nation, compared with the US average of 4.3%.Economists warn that the regional impact of the shutdown will persist well after federal operations resume.Political reverberations are also being felt: Democrat Abigail Spanberger’s win in Virginia’s governor’s race was fuelled in part by her focus on the economic fallout of President Donald Trump ’s policies on the region.Washington’s restaurants, bars, and small retailers — heavily reliant on federal employees’ spending — have reported steep drops in sales. The Restaurant Association of Greater Washington said many eateries already operating on thin margins are now struggling to stay afloat as federal staff skip commutes and dining out.“Going without paychecks is causing cash flow issues for federal workers, and that’s spilling over into small businesses,” said Tracy Hadden Loh, a fellow at Brookings Metro, quoted AP. “A lot of businesses rely on higher spending in Q4 to stay profitable for the year.”At The Queen Vic, a British pub in northeast Washington, co-owner Ryan Gordon said weekend crowds have halved. “We still had seats for people, which means the bars around us who get our overflow got nothing,” he said, estimating business is down 50% since the shutdown began.The financial strain is also pushing middle-income families into crisis. Thea Price, a former employee of the US Institute of Peace, lost her job in March, followed by her husband’s job loss as a government contractor.After relying on SNAP food assistance and savings, the couple’s payments were halted by the shutdown. With limited options left, Price is leaving Washington for her hometown near Seattle.“We can’t afford to stay in the area any longer and hope something might pan out,” she said. “We’re just in a much different place than when these things started.”At the Capital Area Food Bank, forklifts are running overtime to meet growing demand. “We’re focused on getting food to those who need it,” Muthiah said. “But people are borrowing against their futures to pay for basic necessities today.”","Washington’s restaurants, bars, and small retailers — heavily reliant on federal employees’ spending — have reported steep drops in sales.

Markets regulator Sebi has warned investors against putting money into digital or e-gold products, cautioning that such instruments fall outside its regulatory framework and carry significant risks, PTI reported.The advisory follows Sebi’s observation that several online platforms have been promoting “digital gold” or “e-gold” as a convenient alternative to physical gold, without disclosing that these are unregulated products.“In this context, it is informed that such digital gold products are different from Sebi-regulated gold products as they are neither notified as securities nor regulated as commodity derivatives.

"Thanksgiving on budget: US retailers push cheaper private-label meals; here's what Walmart, Target & more are doing",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/thanksgiving-on-budget-us-retailers-push-cheaper-private-label-meals-heres-what-walmart-target-more-are-doing/articleshow/125196537.cms,"



This Thanksgiving, retailers in the United States are leaning heavily on private-label products to promote what they say are the most affordable meal deals in years.Walmart, Target and Aldi are each highlighting cost savings ahead of the holiday, but the reductions come with trimmed menus and more store-brand substitutes.At Walmart, this year's meal bundle includes nine Great Value private-label items out of a total of 15. A year ago, nine of the 21 items were from the retailer’s own brand, according to Reuters.The shift comes after the company removed ingredients such as onions, celery and broth, and introduced its own stuffing mix. The turkey has also changed. Instead of last year’s Honeysuckle White, priced then at 88 cents per pound, the meal now features the more recognisable Butterball turkey at 96 cents per pound.Walmart’s current bundle costs less than $40 and is designed to feed 10 people. Last year’s meal was priced at around $56 and fed eight. The number of items has also dropped, from 29 to 22, although the bundle includes multiples of staples like corn and green beans. Walmart declined to comment on the changes.The lower prices entered the political conversation this week.President Donald Trump, who has faced declining approval ratings on his handling of the economy, has repeatedly mentioned Walmart’s reduced pricing and claimed that holiday costs are down 25% from last year.When a reporter noted that the current basket includes fewer food items, Trump responded that he was not aware of that difference and called the suggestion ""fake news.""Even outside holiday promotions, consumer behaviour mirrors what retailers are doing. A NielsenIQ survey from September found that 58% of shoppers are extremely worried about rising food prices, while 31% said they would opt for private-label brands whenever possible. Government figures show food costs in September were 2.7% higher than a year earlier. At the same time, U.S. consumer sentiment has fallen to its lowest point in three and a half years, and the longest government shutdown in U.S. history has caused delays in SNAP food aid payments, adding pressure for low-income households.""One of our most-asked questions in the store right now is 'How do I save money on my food'?"" said Stew Leonard Jr, CEO of the Connecticut-based Stew Leonard’s chain. ""One of the things we recommend is definitely exploring private label.""Aldi has taken a similar approach. The discount supermarket, known for its private-label dominance, is offering a Thanksgiving spread for $40 to feed 10 people, down from $47 a year ago. The retailer swapped out last year’s Butterball turkey in favour of the cheaper Jennie-O variety, cutting around 30 cents per pound. Butterball is still available for shoppers who prefer it, priced at 97 cents per pound. Aldi has also replaced a single pie crust with a frozen two-pack and reduced pricing on carrots, potatoes and onions.Target’s seven-item meal kit also contains modifications, as per a Reuters report. This year, the retailer introduced its own-brand bread and frozen corn, eliminating nationally known products such as Del Monte green beans and Campbell’s Cream of Mushroom Soup. The kit remains priced at under $20 and is intended to serve four people, the same as last year. A Target spokesperson said that the selection varies slightly each year, based on shopper interest and product availability, adding that most customers do not buy their Thanksgiving items until the week before the holiday.","Walmart, Target and Aldi are each highlighting cost savings ahead of the holiday.

US President Donald Trump has escalated his attack on the Affordable Care Act (ACA), urging Republicans to divert federal healthcare payments directly to Americans instead of insurance companies, as the ongoing government shutdown marks its longest stretch in US history.In a new post on Sunday, Trump repeated his demand that Republicans stop sending what he described as vast sums of money to insurers participating in the ACA marketplace.“NO MORE MONEY, HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS, TO THE DEMOCRAT SUPPORTED INSURANCE COMPANIES FOR REALLY BAD OBAMACARE. THE MONEY MUST NOW GO DIRECTLY TO THE PEOPLE, TAKING THE ‘FAT CAT’ INSURANCE COMPANIES OUT OF THE CORRUPT SYSTEM OF HEALTHCARE,"" he said on Truth Social.The US President further asserted that the people can buy much better policy on their own, “FOR MUCH LESS MONEY, SAVING, FOR THEMSELVES, AN ABSOLUTE FORTUNE!!!”Trump’s remarks follow a similar proposal he posted earlier, in which he pressed Republicans to send ACA-related federal subsidies straight to Americans. He framed the idea as part of a compromise to break the political deadlock over government funding.“I am recommending to Senate Republicans that the Hundreds of Billions of Dollars currently being sent to money sucking Insurance Companies in order to save the bad Healthcare provided by ObamaCare, BE SENT DIRECTLY TO THE PEOPLE SO THAT THEY CAN PURCHASE THEIR OWN, MUCH BETTER, HEALTHCARE, and have money left over,” he wrote on Truth Social.The shutdown began on October 1 and continues without a resolution, after Senate Republicans rejected a proposal from Democratic Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. According to CNBC, Democrats offered to reopen the government by allowing ACA subsidies to remain in place for one year, while dropping their demand to extend Obamacare tax credits for a longer period.Those subsidies support more than 20 million people, and without action by Congress, they will expire at the end of December. Democrats say that figure could reach 24 million when counting Americans who are expected to renew coverage.Republicans have dismissed the Democratic plan, insisting that the government must be reopened before negotiations resume on other policy matters. Senate Majority Leader John Thune labelled the Democrats’ offer a “non-starter.”Beyond the funding fight, Trump is also intensifying pressure on Republicans to eliminate the Senate filibuster, the rule requiring 60 votes to pass most legislation. The GOP currently holds 53 seats in the 100-member chamber, with 45 Democrats and two independents aligned with them, CNBC reported.With neither side offering new concessions, the shutdown continues with millions of Americans caught in the middle.","US President Donald Trump has escalated his attack on the Affordable Care Act (ACA) He is urging Republicans to divert federal healthcare payments directly to Americans instead of insurance companies.

Gold market trends: Prices drop for third week as dollar stays firm; Fed tone and China move weigh on sentiment,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gold-market-trends-prices-drop-for-third-week-as-dollar-stays-firm-fed-tone-and-china-move-weigh-on-sentiment/articleshow/125185607.cms,"Silver underperforms amid industrial demand concerns





Gold prices extended their decline for the third straight week, pressured by a stronger US dollar and cautious remarks from Federal Reserve officials that curbed investor appetite for safe-haven assets, analysts said.The sustained firmness in the greenback and the US central bank’s wait-and-watch stance have kept bullion trading in a narrow range through the holiday-shortened week, they added.On the Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX), gold futures for December delivery slipped Rs 165, or 0.14%, during the week to close at Rs 1,21,067 per 10 grams on Friday. The yellow metal hovered around the Rs 1.21 lakh mark, still Rs 11,000 below its October 17 peak of Rs 1.32 lakh per 10 grams, PTI reported.In global markets, Comex gold futures for December rose $13.3, or 0.33%, in the week to settle at $4,009.8 per ounce on Friday. Prices briefly traded above $4,000 before retreating as the dollar strengthened.“Gold traded in a tight consolidation range through the week. While bargain-buying emerged on mid-week dips, the strong directional momentum visible in October has tapered,” said Chirag Doshi, CIO of Fixed Income Assets, LGT Wealth India.“The market appears to be in a pause-and-assess phase, waiting for cues from the US dollar and Treasury yields before larger positions are taken,” he added.According to NS Ramaswamy, Head of Commodity & CRM at Ventura, gold prices remain supported by expectations of another Fed rate cut. “The dollar index has stayed within the 98–100 range since August. A softer dollar could provide near-term relief for bullion,” he said.Ramaswamy added that the prolonged US government shutdown, now in its second month, has delayed key economic reports, including employment and inflation data, creating a “data vacuum” and heightening uncertainty.“Private reports indicate weakness in the labour market, which could push the Federal Reserve to ease policy rates sooner. Lower rates tend to support gold,” he said.Doshi noted that a stronger dollar and higher bond yields initially weighed on precious metals, while renewed risk aversion later in the week offered limited support. “A key negative catalyst came from China’s decision to reduce its VAT exemption on certain retail gold purchases, likely cooling physical demand sentiment in Asia,” he said.Silver followed a similar consolidation pattern, underperforming gold as industrial sentiment weakened amid global slowdown worries.On the MCX, silver futures for December delivery fell Rs 559, or 0.38%, during the week to close at Rs 1,47,728 per kilogram on Friday. Comex silver futures for December also edged lower to settle at $48.14 an ounce.“Silver continued to show high-beta behaviour, moving more sharply than gold on both upswings and pullbacks,” said Doshi. “Short bursts of festive and industrial demand triggered quick rallies, but these were offset by profit-taking, suggesting short-term traders are driving price action.”He added that continued ETF outflows have removed a key support factor, making domestic prices more vulnerable to global volatility. However, the weak rupee helped cushion losses, leading to consolidation rather than a steep correction, Doshi said.","On the Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX), gold futures for December delivery slipped Rs 165, or 0.14%, during the week to close at Rs 1,21,067 per 10 grams.

"Marine reform: Centre notifies new deep-sea fishing rules; bans foreign vessels, empowers cooperatives",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/marine-reform-centre-notifies-new-deep-sea-fishing-rules-bans-foreign-vessels-empowers-cooperatives-what-changes-for-indian-fishers/articleshow/125185078.cms,"



In a major policy shift aimed at unlocking India’s vast marine wealth, the Centre has notified new rules for deep-sea fishing in the country’s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) — prioritising fishermen cooperatives, small-scale fishers, and digital transparency, while banning foreign vessels from Indian waters.The rules, notified on November 4, fulfil the government’s Budget 2025-26 promise and are designed to expand opportunities in India’s marine fisheries sector, especially in high-value tuna fishing — a resource long underutilised by Indian fleets despite heavy exploitation by other nations in the Indian Ocean, PTI reported.According to the Ministry of Fisheries, the new framework gives first preference to Fishermen Cooperative Societies and Fish Farmer Producer Organisations (FFPOs) for deep-sea operations using technologically advanced vessels.A major innovation is the introduction of the “mother-and-child vessel” model, which allows mid-sea transhipment under RBI guidelines — particularly benefiting the Andaman & Nicobar and Lakshadweep Islands, which together make up nearly 49% of India’s EEZ.The new rules prohibit harmful practices such as LED light fishing, pair trawling, and bull trawling to protect the marine ecosystem. Fisheries Management Plans will now be developed in consultation with stakeholders, while minimum legal sizes for fish species will also be notified.Mechanised and large motorised vessels will require a free Access Pass through the ReALCRaft portal, while traditional and small-scale fishers using motorised or non-motorised crafts are exempt. The digital process allows owners to apply and track approvals in real time without visiting government offices.So far, 2.38 lakh fishing vessels have been registered on the portal across 13 coastal states and Union Territories. Around 64,187 mechanised vessels will now need Access Passes for EEZ operations, while foreign vessels are completely barred, ensuring that small-scale Indian fishers remain protected.The ReALCRaft system is being integrated with the Marine Products Export Development Authority (MPEDA) and the Export Inspection Council (EIC) to issue Fish Catch and Health Certificates, ensuring traceability and sanitary compliance for seafood exports to premium global markets.The new rules also align revenue norms by recognising fish caught from India’s EEZ as ‘Indian origin’, ensuring they are not treated as imports when landed at domestic ports.The government will extend full support through training programmes, international exposure visits, and capacity-building initiatives across the marine value chain — including processing, marketing, and exports. Credit access will be facilitated under the Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY) and the Fisheries and Aquaculture Infrastructure Development Fund (FIDF).To enhance safety, the rules make transponders and QR-coded Aadhaar/Fishers ID cards mandatory for identification and tracking. The ReALCRaft system will also link to the Nabhmitra app, used for real-time navigation and coastal security by the Indian Coast Guard and Navy.India’s 11,099 km coastline and 23-lakh sq km EEZ support over 50 lakh livelihoods in the fishing community. The country ranks second globally in fish production and aquaculture, with exports valued at Rs 60,000 crore, but its deep-sea potential — especially in tuna-rich waters — remains largely untapped.The new policy, combining community participation, digital governance, and sustainable practices, aims to strengthen India’s footprint in the global seafood trade while ensuring long-term ecological balance.","The rules are designed to expand opportunities in India’s marine fisheries sector, especially in high-value tuna fishing.Mechanised and large motorised vessels will require a free Access Pass through the ReALCRaft portal.

Sustainability push: Tea Board urges strict food safety compliance; new code promotes eco-friendly pest control and worker welfare,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sustainability-push-tea-board-urges-strict-food-safety-compliance-new-code-promotes-eco-friendly-pest-control-and-worker-welfare/articleshow/125184517.cms,"



The Tea Board has called on the industry to adopt food safety standards more effectively, saying compliance will be critical for long-term sustainability and competitiveness in both domestic and global markets.Releasing its new Plant Protection Code (PPC), the Board said adherence to food safety norms would not only protect the plantation ecosystem but also ensure the welfare of tea workers and small growers, PTI reported.The updated PPC promotes sustainability through good agricultural practices, including integrated pest management (IPM) and the use of alternative pest control measures to gradually reduce chemical dependence.“Large-scale adoption of integrated pest management from the very beginning of the season will be crucial in ensuring food safety and adequate crop protection,” the Tea Board said in a statement.It noted that consumers are increasingly demanding products that are safe and environmentally responsible. “Given this situation, there is a need for a judicious usage of plant protection formulations,” the Board added.The PPC provides detailed guidelines for the safe use of plant protection chemicals in tea cultivation. Compliance, it said, would help improve the competitiveness of tea estates while ensuring conformity with national and international regulatory standards.The Board highlighted that India’s tea-growing regions face climatic conditions conducive to pest infestations, which cause annual crop losses of 15–30%. Maintaining yield and quality, therefore, requires careful pest management aligned with safety standards.“The use of plant protection formulations in a safe and controlled manner is essential for maintaining yield and the quality of tea leaf production,” the Board said.",The Tea Board has called on the industry to adopt food safety standards more effectively.

Several startups from Singapore and Canada have expressed interest in expanding into India, drawn by its vast consumer base, rapid economic growth, and increasingly supportive startup ecosystem.The companies shared their plans during interactions with PTI on the sidelines of EPIC 2025, a global pitch competition organised by the Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks Corporation (HKSTP), which concluded on Friday evening.From over 1,200 applications spanning 70 economies, 100 startups — including two from India — were shortlisted under three categories: Digital Health Tech, FinTech, and GreenTech. The event serves as a global platform connecting founders with investors, corporate partners, and emerging markets.Sunny Chai, Chairman of HKSTP, said, “We are turning Hong Kong’s connectivity into momentum, helping ideas move and scale across borders. EPIC 2025 is a testament to this, where entrepreneurs connect with emerging markets, enthusiastic investors, and world-class innovation ecosystems.”Bryan Oh, Founder and CEO of Singapore-based NEU Battery Materials, said the company plans to scale globally to tackle battery recycling challenges.“Battery recycling is not just a problem for Singapore or Hong Kong; it’s a global problem. We want to solve it using our process and technology,” Oh said, PTI quoted.Referring to India, he added, “It has a huge number of two-wheelers and three-wheelers… It’s definitely a market we are looking at. I would love to know more about government initiatives and policies in India.”Singapore-based Belli, which develops air cargo software for airlines, also sees India as a promising opportunity. “India is a fast-growing economy and it will be great to be a part of this journey,” said Jayden Lu, Product Engineer at Belli. “I see a great future for startups in India.”From Canada, KA Imaging — which has developed colour X-ray technology for real-time imaging of human organs — is also exploring an India entry. “We need to find the right partners and investors to accelerate our work there,” said its President and CEO, Amol S Karnick.Karnick noted the Indian government’s recent funding push in science and medical technology. “That’s an interesting opportunity for us. The fund is the most important. I need to explore more how policies can support us,” he said.","Several startups from Singapore and Canada have expressed interest in expanding into India.

India’s data centre industry is on track for a major expansion, with total capacity projected to jump five times to 8GW by 2030, according to a sectoral report by Jefferies.The growth is expected to be driven by the surge in data consumption, rapid cloud adoption, regulatory data localisation rules, and the increasing use of artificial intelligence (AI) applications.As per the report, the expansion will call for an estimated investment of around $30 billion and could boost data centre leasing revenues fivefold to reach $8 billion by the end of the decade.India’s colocation data centre capacity — where businesses lease space and infrastructure from operators — has already seen a fivefold rise to 1.7GW.According to the news agency ANI, the sector is operating at nearly full capacity, with occupancy levels averaging 97 per cent, highlighting robust demand.The report added that Mumbai and Chennai together host about 70 per cent of the total installed capacity, with Mumbai alone contributing roughly half, owing to its proximity to undersea cable landing stations and its strong presence of banking and financial service clients.By 2030, Bharti Airtel, Reliance, and Adani Enterprises (via AdaniConneX) are projected to account for 35–40 per cent of India’s data centre capacity.AdaniConneX and Reliance are expected to lead nearly one-third of the planned capacity additions, while the top five players currently dominate 90 per cent of the market, led by NTT GDC with about a 20 per cent share.The report further noted that AI adoption will intensify demand since AI servers consume five to six times more power and require advanced liquid cooling systems compared to traditional data centres.Regulatory developments like the Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Act, 2023, and RBI’s data localisation guidelines are also pushing enterprises to store and process data within India.According to Jefferies, the anticipated $30 billion capital expenditure will generate opportunities across sectors — including $10 billion in electrical and power systems, $7 billion in racks and fit-outs, $6 billion in real estate, $4 billion in cooling systems, and $1 billion in network infrastructure.","India’s data centre industry is on track for a major expansion, with total capacity projected to jump five times to 8GW by 2030.

India has reiterated that equitable, predictable, and concessional climate finance remains central to achieving global climate goals, underscoring the principle of fairness and shared responsibility at the Leaders’ Summit of COP30 in Belem, Brazil.Delivering India’s National Statement, Ambassador Dinesh Bhatia said the country’s climate action continues to be guided by equity, national circumstances, and the principles of Common but Differentiated Responsibilities and Respective Capabilities (CBDR-RC), ANI reported.The 30th Conference of the Parties (COP30) to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) will be held in Belem from November 10 to 21. India thanked Brazil for hosting the summit on the 10th anniversary of the Paris Agreement and recalled the legacy of the Rio Summit, which laid the foundation for global climate governance.“This is an opportunity to reflect on the global response to climate change and celebrate the legacy of the Rio Summit, where the principles of equity and CBDR-RC were adopted,” the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change said in a statement.India welcomed Brazil’s initiative to establish the Tropical Forests Forever Facility (TFFF) and joined the platform as an Observer, calling it a vital step toward protecting tropical ecosystems through sustained global collaboration.Highlighting its domestic progress, India said it has reduced the emission intensity of its GDP by 36% between 2005 and 2020 and achieved over 50% non-fossil power capacity—reaching its revised Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) targets five years ahead of schedule.The statement also noted the creation of an additional carbon sink of 2.29 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent between 2005 and 2021, and India’s position as the world’s third-largest producer of renewable energy with nearly 200 GW of installed capacity.Citing initiatives such as the International Solar Alliance, which now connects over 120 countries, India highlighted its leadership in promoting affordable renewable energy and South-South cooperation.The country expressed concern that while developing nations are taking decisive steps toward emission reduction, many developed countries continue to fall short of their NDC commitments. India urged advanced economies to accelerate emission cuts and deliver on their pledges for predictable finance, technology transfer, and capacity-building support.“India is ready to collaborate with all nations to implement sustainable solutions in ways that are ambitious, inclusive, fair, and equitable,” the ministry said.Reaffirming its commitment to the Paris Agreement and multilateralism, India called for the next decade of climate action to focus on implementation, resilience, and shared responsibility grounded in trust and fairness.At COP26 in 2021, India announced its five-part “Panchamrit” pledge, which includes reaching 500 GW of non-fossil electricity capacity, meeting half of energy needs through renewables, reducing emissions by 1 billion tonnes by 2030, cutting emissions intensity of GDP by 45%, and achieving net-zero emissions by 2070.India’s renewable energy growth continues to outpace coal additions, according to a recent S&P Global Ratings report, placing the country among the leaders in South and Southeast Asia.",The 30th Conference of the Parties (COP30) to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) will be held in Belem from November 10 to 21.

Rural demand surge: Countryside drives India’s consumption rebound; urban growth seen picking up in Q3 FY26,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/rural-demand-surge-countryside-drives-indias-consumption-rebound-urban-growth-seen-picking-up-in-q3-fy26/articleshow/125182631.cms,"AI image





Rural India continues to drive the country’s consumption rebound, outpacing urban markets despite recent policy measures aimed at stimulating city-based spending, according to Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd. (MOFSL).According to MOFSL’s latest ECOSCOPE report titled “Rural Rules, Urban Follows,” rural consumption rose 7.7 per cent year-on-year in the second quarter of FY26 — the highest in 17 quarters.“We observed that rural consumption continues to outperform urban consumption despite the income tax cuts and GST 2.0 reforms, which are aimed at boosting urban consumption,” the report stated.MOFSL attributed this steady uptrend to a combination of supportive factors, including rising real agricultural and non-agricultural wages, robust farm credit, higher tractor and fertiliser sales, improved rainfall distribution, and stable minimum support prices (MSPs).It added that easing input costs have further strengthened farm incomes, enabling sustained spending power in rural regions.Urban consumption, however, remained muted in the same period ahead of the festive season.Nonetheless, as per news agency ANI, indicators such as personal credit expansion, petrol consumption, and non-farm imports pointed to continued resilience in discretionary spending, even though passenger traffic stayed largely flat.The report anticipates urban demand to gain momentum in the third quarter of FY26, supported by GST 2.0 implementation and recent price reductions.Channel checks by the brokerage suggested a mixed recovery across retail categories — autos and jewellery showed improvement, while footwear, paints, FMCG and textiles posted uneven trends.Within FMCG, general trade demand in October remained stable, but MOFSL noted that alternative retail formats could drive growth divergence across firms in the months ahead.The report also pointed to strong high-frequency indicators in October, including e-way bill generation, petrol usage, mall footfalls and PMI readings, signalling sustained consumption momentum across sectors.Looking ahead, MOFSL expects rural demand to maintain its strong growth path, supported by higher real wages, favourable rabi prospects, and controlled inflation.Urban consumption, meanwhile, is projected to strengthen during the festive quarter, led by discretionary categories such as jewellery.The brokerage maintained its baseline projection for real GDP growth at 6.8 per cent in FY26, with nominal growth estimated at 9 per cent.It added that easing tariff-related uncertainties could lift real GDP growth by an additional 20–30 basis points.","Rural India continues to drive the country’s consumption rebound, outpacing urban markets.

Pfizer is poised to acquire US-based biotechnology firm Metsera in a $10 billion deal, after winning a heated bidding battle against Danish drugmaker Novo Nordisk, which has now withdrawn from the race, AFP reported.Metsera, which specialises in obesity treatments, said in a statement that Pfizer’s improved offer of $86.25 per share had been unanimously approved by its board, which recommended that shareholders support the merger at a meeting scheduled for November 13.“The board unanimously recommends that stockholders approve the adoption of the amended Pfizer merger agreement and approve the merger,” the company said, adding that the deal was expected to close “promptly” after the vote.Pfizer’s latest proposal nearly doubles Metsera’s valuation compared to their initial agreement in September, which triggered a counterbid from Novo Nordisk and set off a fierce price war between the two pharmaceutical giants.Novo Nordisk, the maker of blockbuster weight-loss drug Wegovy and diabetes treatment Ozempic, announced that it would not raise its offer further. “The company does not intend to make an increased offer to acquire Metsera,” it said, adding that it would continue pursuing “strategic acquisitions” aligned with its long-term growth goals.Metsera revealed that the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) had contacted the company regarding “potential risks” associated with the proposed Novo Nordisk transaction under US antitrust laws — a factor that strengthened the board’s decision to support Pfizer’s offer instead.The company’s board concluded that the Novo Nordisk deal “presents unacceptably high legal and regulatory risks... compared to the proposed merger with Pfizer.” Novo Nordisk, however, maintained that its proposal was “compliant with antitrust laws.”The battle for Metsera reflects the growing competition in the global obesity treatment market, an area where pharmaceutical majors are racing to capture share amid surging global demand for weight-loss and diabetes drugs.According to the World Health Organization, more than one billion people worldwide were living with obesity and over 800 million with diabetes as of 2022.",Pfizer is poised to acquire US-based biotechnology firm Metsera in a $10 billion deal.

Donald Trump tariffs hit Indian restaurants in New York,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/donald-trump-tariffs-hit-indian-restaurants-in-new-york-heres-whats-causing-misery/articleshow/125180372.cms,"AI image

Justice Thomas Throws Curveball At Dem Lawyer On Trump Tariffs: 'What About Embargoes?'





Indian restaurants in New York City, which have recently outshone their London counterparts and become favourites among Wall Street executives, are now facing mounting pressure from higher import costs after US President Donald Trump’s tariff moves.On July 31, Trump doubled tariffs on most Indian exports to 50%, a measure that took effect on August 27. Though the legality of the decision is currently being reviewed by the Supreme Court, the impact has already hit restaurants, grocers, and food manufacturers relying on Indian ingredients.Prices of essentials such as spices, basmati rice, pulses, and tea have surged, squeezing already thin profit margins.Chef Salil Mehta, who runs Kebab aur Sharab and other eateries under the Fungi Hospitality Group, was quoted by ET as saying that the price of a 40-pound basmati rice bag jumped from $30 to $45, while chilli powder now costs $10.50, up from $7.“People don’t mind paying $35 for pasta, but Indian food still carries the perception that it should be cheap,” he said.Mehta has raised entree prices by about $5 but admits that margins remain lower than before.At Lungi, chef-owner Albin Vincent is dealing with similar challenges. He said his ingredient costs have risen by around 25%, forcing him to reassess prices for dosas and biryanis, which currently remain under $28.“If we raise prices, we risk driving away customers who may already be sensitive to price increases,” Vincent said, as per ET.Passerine owner Maneesh Goyal said the cost of imported daal and ghee has climbed steeply, with a case of ghee rising from $150 to $220, a 46% increase.“As a new Indian restaurant, we don’t yet have the flexibility to increase prices,” he said.While JKS Restaurants’ CEO Pavan Pardasani said their new US outlets haven’t yet been affected, others, such as Chef Mohammad Tarique Khan of Hyderabadi Zaiqa, are struggling.“Rice costs have gone from $45 to $69 for a 25-lb bag,” Khan said, adding that he hasn’t raised menu prices since most of his customers are local residents and students.The problem isn’t limited to restaurants. As per ET, snack makers like Doosra’s founder Kartik Das have faced supply delays and inventory shortages. Das, who previously sourced ingredients such as boondi and amchur from India, said uncertainty over tariff rates has pushed him to find US suppliers.Similarly, Keya Wingfield, who runs Keya’s Snacks in Virginia, said tariffs on imported spices have been “astronomical.”A recent 200-pound air shipment incurred a $1,700 freight tariff, drastically inflating costs.“Money we could have used for advertising or deliveries has gone to tariffs,” she said.As Mehta summed up, “Margins are getting slimmer. The market will adjust eventually, but it’s going to be survival of the fittest.”","US President Donald Trump doubled tariffs on most Indian exports to 50%.

The Nasdaq Composite ended slightly lower on Friday but posted its sharpest weekly loss since early April, as investors questioned how long the artificial intelligence boom could sustain recent market highs.The index slipped 0.21% to 23,004.54, bringing its total weekly fall to around 3%, while chipmakers and technology shares led the declines.Despite this pullback, the Nasdaq has surged more than 50% since April, when US President Donald Trump announced wide-ranging tariffs, with AI optimism lifting markets to record levels.However, sentiment cooled this week after Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang was quoted by The Financial Times as saying that China may surpass the US in the AI race.“We’re seeing this AI selloff continue after the comments we had about China winning the AI race,” said Michael O’Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Stamford, Connecticut, as per news agency Reuters.He added that the sector’s weakness reflected “a recalibration of multiples” and some investors taking profits after a strong run.The S&P 500 rose 0.13% to 6,728.81, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.16% to 46,987.10, both rebounding late in the session after reports suggested progress in ending the longest federal government shutdown in US history.The global equities index MSCI (.MIWD00000PUS) slipped 0.07%, and the STOXX 600 in Europe lost 0.55%, as weak trade data from China renewed worries over slowing global growth.Chinese exports fell 1.1% in October, the steepest decline since February, underscoring the damage from Trump’s tariffs and denting investor confidence across Asia.In the bond market, US treasury yields edged down after surveys pointed to worsening consumer sentiment.The University of Michigan’s preliminary index for November dropped to 50.3, the lowest since June 2022, driven by record-low views of current economic conditions amid concerns over the shutdown.The 10-year Treasury yield eased slightly to 4.091%.The US dollar weakened against major currencies, with the dollar index slipping 0.11% to 99.57.The euro firmed to $1.1563, while the yen weakened to 153.45 per dollar. As per Reuters, the shutdown has delayed key economic reports, though current indicators suggest the economy remains resilient, potentially reducing pressure for the Federal Reserve to cut rates at its December meeting.Meanwhile, oil prices rebounded on optimism after Trump met Hungary’s Prime Minister Viktor Orbán at the White House, fuelling hopes that Hungary could use Russian crude.US crude settled 32 cents higher at $59.75 per barrel, while Brent rose 25 cents to $63.63. Gold prices also firmed as investors sought safety amid uncertainty.","The Nasdaq Composite ended slightly lower on Friday but posted its sharpest weekly loss since early April.

US President Donald Trump has directed the justice department to investigate major meatpacking companies for alleged collusion and price manipulation amid record-high beef prices.In a post on Truth Social, Trump accused meat firms of “driving up the price of beef through illicit collusion, price fixing, and price manipulation,” saying he had ordered an immediate inquiry.Attorney general Pam Bondi confirmed on X that the investigation was under way, led by agriculture secretary Brooke Rollins and assistant attorney General Gail Slater, who heads the department’s antitrust division.The probe will examine whether leading processors have engaged in practices that distort market competition.According to, Tyson Foods, Cargill, JBS USA, and National Beef Packing Company together process about 85% of US grain-fed cattle, which supply steaks and beef cuts across the country.The justice department has not named any specific targets so far.Beef prices have reached new highs in 2025, fuelled by droughts that damaged pasturelands and raised feed costs, forcing ranchers to cut the national herd to its smallest in nearly 75 years.Data from the Bureau of Labour Statistics showed the retail price of ground chuck beef at $6.33 per pound in September, up 13.5% from last year.Despite soaring costs, consumer demand has remained strong.Rollins said on X, “We need transparency, accountability, and a fair market that rewards those who actually raise and produce our beef — not the corporate middlemen gaming the system.”The Meat Institute, which represents major processors, rejected the claims, arguing the industry is “heavily regulated” and “market transactions are transparent.”Its CEO, Julie Anna Potts, said that despite high retail prices, “beef packers have been losing money because the price of cattle is at record highs”, reported Reuters.Trump’s move came days after Republican losses in elections dominated by concerns over the rising cost of living.He said the action aims to “protect our American ranchers” from “majority foreign-owned meat packers who artificially inflate prices and jeopardise national food security.”The justice department’s antitrust division can issue subpoenas and pursue both civil and criminal investigations into anti-competitive conduct.Slater, a former adviser to Vice President JD Vance, has said her office will focus on “pocketbook issues” like food, housing, and transport.Industry consolidation has long drawn criticism from ranchers. Advocacy group R-CALF USA said the sector’s concentration is “well beyond the level normally considered a harm to the economy.”The companies involved have previously paid millions to settle price-fixing lawsuits but denied wrongdoing.he investigation follows Trump’s previous call to lower beef prices by increasing imports from Argentina — a suggestion that angered ranchers, according to news agency AFP.The National Cattlemen’s Beef Association said the move could “undercut the future of family farmers and ranchers.”","US President Donald Trump orders investigation into meatpacking companies.

US warns it could force 20% flight cuts









More than 1,000 flights were cancelled across the United States on Friday after the Trump administration ordered reductions to ease strain on air traffic controllers working without pay amid a federal govt shutdown. Forty airports were slated for cuts, including major hubs in Atlanta, Newark, Denver, Chicago, Houston and Los Angeles.The flight reductions took effect gradually, starting at four per cent and rising to 10 per cent next week if Congress still had not reached a funding deal. The cancellations followed a bitter standoff between Republicans and Democrats over health insurance subsidies, which led federal agencies to grind to a halt after funding lapsed on October 1, AFP reported.Many govt employees, including vital airport staff, were either working without pay or furloughed at home as the nearly six-week crisis continued. More than 1,000 flights scheduled for Friday were cancelled, according to tracking website FlightAware.The most affected airports late Friday were Reagan National in Washington, Denver International and Hartsfield-Jackson in Atlanta, data analysed by AFP showed.According to the Federal Aviation Administration, travellers at Reagan National were seeing average delays of four hours, with 90-minute waits in Phoenix and one-hour delays in Chicago and San Francisco.“This is frustrating. We don't need to be in this position,” American Airlines CEO Robert Isom told CNBC.The upheaval meant ordinary Americans were now directly feeling the impacts of the Washington budget fight that had shut down much of the govt. US Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy blamed Democrats for the shutdown, saying they should vote to reopen the govt. “If Democrats are going to go home this weekend, and they've kept the government shut down, that's shameful,” Duffy told reporters at Reagan National Airport.In a post on Truth Social, President Donald Trump on Friday also called on Senate lawmakers to remain in Washington until an agreement to end the shutdown was reached. Republicans controlled Congress, but Democrats had said they would refuse to sign off on the majority party's budget plans, including severe healthcare cuts.US Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy warned on Friday he could compel airlines to cut up to 20% of flights if the govt shutdown did not end, as US carriers scrambled to comply with unprecedented govt-imposed reductions, as per Reuters.The Federal Aviation Administration instructed airlines to cut 4% of flights on Friday at 40 major airports, a figure set to rise to 10% by November 14. The cuts began at 6 am ET (1100 GMT) and affect about 700 flights operated by the four largest carriers – American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Southwest Airlines and United Airlines. Duffy said the FAA based its decision on safety data, including incidents of planes failing to maintain separation and ground incursions.On Friday air traffic controller absences forced the FAA to delay hundreds of flights at ten airports, including Atlanta, San Francisco, Houston, Phoenix, Washington, DC and Newark. By 7.30 pm ET (1130 GMT) there were more than 5,300 flight delays, according to FlightAware.At Reagan Washington National, delays averaged four hours, while 17% of flights were cancelled and nearly 40% delayed. During the record 38-day govt shutdown 13,000 air traffic controllers and 50,000 security screeners have been compelled to work without pay, leading to increased absenteeism.","More than 1,000 flights were cancelled across the United States on Friday.

Relief for Orban: US grants Hungary one-year exemption from Russian oil sanctions; here's why,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/relief-for-orban-us-grants-hungary-one-year-exemption-from-russian-oil-sanctions-heres-why/articleshow/125177115.cms,"AP file photo

After Joking About Ukraine With Trump, Orban Secures Exemption From Russian Oil Sanctions | Watch

Why Trump exempted Hungary

What it means for Hungary

Russia-Ukraine war





The United States has granted Hungary a one-year exemption from its sanctions on the use of Russian oil and gas, a White House official said on Friday.The decision came after Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán personally appealed for the reprieve during a meeting with US President Donald Trump in Washington.Orbán, a favorite of the MAGA movement and global conservatives, met the US president at the White House on Friday for their first bilateral meeting since the Republican returned to power, explaining why Hungary still needed Russian oil despite Trump urging Europe to stop importing it.Trump noted that Hungary faces challenges sourcing oil and gas elsewhere because it is landlocked and lacks ports, making alternatives difficult.“We’re looking at it, because it’s very different for him to get the oil and gas from other areas,” Trump said, as cited by the Guardian. “As you know, they don’t have ... the advantage of having sea. It’s a great country, it’s a big country, but they don’t have sea. They don’t have the ports.”Orbán said the issue was vital for Hungary, a European country, and pledged to lay out “the consequences for the Hungarian people, and for the Hungarian economy, not to get oil and gas from Russia.”Trump, aiming to put pressure on Moscow to end its war with Ukraine, appeared sympathetic to Orbán’s position.For Orbán, the exemption has shielded Hungary from the severe economic impact of last month’s US sanctions on two Russian oil giants. He had warned Trump that cutting Russian energy would bring Hungary’s economy “to its knees.”Trump also questioned why many European countries continued buying Russian oil and gas despite longstanding sanctions. He noted that, as part of the deal, Hungary also committed to purchasing around $600 million worth of US liquefied natural gas.The meeting was seen as a friendly summit, with Trump calling Orbán a great friend “beloved” in Hungary, and Orbán hoping for a “golden age” in US-Hungary relations.But US sanctions on Russia’s top energy companies are causing tension. Hungary depends heavily on Russian energy, and Orbán said the penalties are hurting the country’s struggling economy ahead of a tough reelection.On Friday, Orbán said his meeting with Trump would cover economic and military matters, along with political cooperation, but he emphasized that the primary focus was on the war in neighboring Ukraine.""It's a most important issue for us, and we would like to discuss with you how we can contribute to help you in your peace efforts,"" Orban told Trump, as reported by the NYT.Last month, Trump announced plans to meet his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, in Budapest, but the meeting was postponed after Russia rejected a ceasefire.","Hungary has been granted a one-year exemption from US sanctions on the use of Russian oil and gas.

Pay package paves way to trillionaire status



Musk’s vision: From chips to cybercabs



Investor division over xAI investment



A roller coaster ride







Tesla CEO Elon Musk celebrated shareholder approval of his record-breaking $1 trillion compensation package with a flurry of ambitious promises, from humanoid robots performing surgery to building vehicles for missions to the Moon and Mars.The vote, which saw over 75% of investors back the deal, clears the path for Musk to expand his stake in Tesla to around 25% over the next decade and potentially become the world’s first trillionaire.Musk used the meeting to outline Tesla’s futuristic roadmap. He claimed the company’s humanoid robot, Optimus, would soon evolve from handing out candy to performing surgery “with beyond-human precision.”He also teased that both Optimus and Tesla’s vehicles could one day play a key role in establishing bases on the Moon and Mars. “It’ll be something cool — a next-level moon buggy or Mars buggy,” Musk told shareholders, Bloomberg reported.The billionaire added that Tesla aims to boost its car production by roughly 50% by the end of 2026, despite ongoing challenges in its automotive division, which is facing its second consecutive year of declining sales.“It’s not just a new chapter for Tesla, it’s a new book,” Musk declared during the company’s annual meeting in Austin, Texas.“That new book is about massively increasing vehicle production and ramping up Optimus production faster than anything in human history,” he added.The approval of Musk’s massive stock award cements his control over Tesla at a time when he had hinted he might divert more attention to other ventures if the deal failed.General Counsel Brandon Ehrhart announced that more than three-quarters of votes supported the package, prompting a standing ovation.The plan sets performance targets that could raise Tesla’s market value to $8.5 trillion, enough to make Musk’s total stake worth roughly $2.4 trillion, according to Bloomberg estimates. That figure would surpass the GDP of nearly every country except a handful of the largest economies.“There are significant hurdles,” noted Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities. “Musk now has to execute on the most important chapter in Tesla’s history, an autonomous and robotic future.”The compensation plan faced resistance from several institutional investors and proxy advisory firms, including Norway’s Norges Bank Investment Management and Glass Lewis, who cited its “unprecedented scale” and potential dilution of other shareholders.According to Bloomberg, critics also accused Tesla’s board of being overly deferential to Musk. New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli called the deal “pay for unchecked power, not pay for performance,” while Senator Bernie Sanders described it as “totally absurd.”Musk acknowledged that Tesla’s growth will depend heavily on securing enough chips for its advanced technologies. He suggested that Tesla may build its own semiconductor facility to supplement existing supply from companies like Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.“Even in the best-case scenario, the chip supply from our partners won’t meet our needs,” Musk said. “So we may have to build a Tesla terafab — like giga, but way bigger” he added.He revealed that three new products are expected to enter production next year — the humanoid Optimus, the long-delayed Semi truck, and the steering-wheel-less Cybercab, Tesla’s autonomous ride-hailing vehicle.While shareholders largely supported Musk’s pay deal, they were split over another proposal — a potential investment in Musk’s artificial intelligence company, xAI. Ehrhart said that although more votes were cast in favor than against, there was “a significant number” of abstentions.The measure was advisory and non-binding, meaning Tesla is not required to follow through. Musk has previously suggested Tesla could inject up to $5 billion into xAI to accelerate development in AI and robotics integration.Musk’s wealth has seen major swings this year. It peaked around $450 billion in January when he appeared alongside President Donald Trump at his inauguration but fell sharply amid political controversies and consumer backlash. A feud with Trump over policy disagreements later sent Tesla shares tumbling.His fortune has since rebounded, buoyed by a recovery in Tesla stock and rising valuations for SpaceX and his AI venture xAI. As of this week, Musk’s net worth stood at around $460 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.Tesla’s shares slipped as much as 4.8% on Friday morning amid a broader market downturn, even as Musk vowed to “massively scale production and push the limits of human innovation.”","Elon Musk celebrated shareholder approval of his record-breaking $1 trillion compensation package with a flurry of ambitious promises.

Crypto market wipeout: Digital assets erase nearly all 2025 gains after early-October record high,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/crypto-market-wipeout-digital-assets-erase-nearly-all-2025-gains-after-early-october-record-high/articleshow/125166933.cms,"Bitcoin slides below key support







The global cryptocurrency market has lost significant ground after reaching a record high earlier this month, with traders pulling back amid fears of deeper losses.At its October 6 peak, the total market capitalisation of all cryptocurrencies hit nearly $4.4 trillion. However, a 20% slump since then has erased most of this year’s gains, leaving the asset class up just 2.5% in 2025, according to CoinGecko data.The downturn began shortly after the all-time high, when roughly $19 billion in leveraged positions were suddenly liquidated, a move that shattered investor confidence. Since then, traders have shown little appetite to bet on a quick rebound.The selloff comes despite what had been a bullish year for the sector, marked by increased regulatory clarity and growing institutional interest.President Donald Trump’s push to make the US a global crypto hub had earlier triggered a 35% rally in Bitcoin. But sentiment has since reversed sharply, with the total crypto market value now lower than when Trump took office.Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency, has fallen 9% this week, putting it on track for its worst weekly performance since March.It has also slipped below its 200-day moving average, a crucial technical level that had held since the 2022 bear market.As of Friday afternoon in London, Bitcoin was trading just below $100,000.While the recent downturn has hit the entire crypto market, altcoins, smaller and more volatile tokens, have suffered the steepest losses, lagging far behind Bitcoin and Ether this year.According to Bloomberg, Jeff Mei, chief operating officer at crypto exchange BTSE, attributed the latest slide in digital assets partly to growing worries that AI stocks are excessively overvalued.He cautioned that a broader correction in tech could deepen the crypto slump, saying, “If AI and tech stocks see a major selloff, Bitcoin could easily slip below the $100,000 mark — and altcoins may tumble even further.”Still, there are tentative signs of stabilisation. After six straight days of withdrawals, US spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs recorded $253 million in inflows on Thursday, offering a brief respite to the battered market.","At its October 6 peak, the total market capitalisation of all cryptocurrencies hit nearly $4.4 trillion.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor ( CEA ) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas.

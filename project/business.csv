US Fed Meeting: Top Highlights & Takeaways

Recent economic indicators point towards sustained robust growth in economic activity, despite fluctuations in net exports affecting the data, the policy statement said.

US Fed has penciled in two rate cuts later this year - a total of 50 basis points cut as per median forecast.

US Fed has forecasted higher inflation and lower US GDP growth. Officials at the Federal Reserve anticipate that inflation, based on their preferred measurement, will increase to 3% towards the end of this year, compared to 2.1% recorded in April.

Their projections indicate the unemployment rate will climb to 4.5%, up from the present rate of 4.2%.

The US GDP growth is expected to come down to 1.4% this year, showing a significant reduction from the previous year's 2.5%.

Labour market stability persists with low unemployment rates and steady employment conditions. Price levels continue to show moderate elevation, it said.

Whilst economic uncertainty has decreased, it still remains elevated. The Committee maintains vigilance regarding risks to both aspects of its dual mandate.

The Committee continues to evaluate incoming data's implications for economic prospects whilst determining suitable monetary policy stance. Should any risks surface that might hinder achieving the Committee's objectives, they stand ready to modify monetary policy accordingly. The evaluations encompass diverse factors, including labour market status, inflation metrics and expectations, alongside financial and global economic trends, the statement added.

US Fed Chair Defies Donald Trump

US Fed Meeting: The US Federal Reserve, led by chair Jerome Powell, kept interest rates unchanged at its monetary policy meeting on Wednesday, defying President Donald Trump ’s call for a rate cut.“In support of its goals, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 4-1/4 to 4-1/2 percent. In considering the extent and timing of additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. The Committee will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage‑backed securities. The Committee is strongly committed to supporting maximum employment and returning inflation to its 2 percent objective,” the US Federal Reserve statement reads.The US central bank has maintained its key interest rate steady in the current year, ranging between 4.25 percent and 4.50 percent. Market observers had widely anticipated that Fed officials will maintain their current position until inflation shows consistent signs of moderation.During the Federal Reserve's second day of meetings, Trump intensified his demands for interest rate cuts, directing criticism at Federal Reserve Chairman Powell whilst dismissing inflation concerns.""We have a stupid person, frankly, at the Fed, he probably won't cut today,"" Trump remarked about Powell, making these comments just hours before the Federal Reserve's scheduled announcement.""We have no inflation, we have only success, and I'd like to see interest rates get down,"" he continued whilst speaking at the White House. ""Maybe I should go to the Fed. Am I allowed to appoint myself?""Inflation has shown a downward trend since January, and economic experts indicate that without elevated import duties, the Federal Reserve would be implementing further rate reductions.The Trump administration has intensified its criticism of Powell regarding borrowing costs, with Trump directly referring to the Fed chair as a ""numbskull"" for not implementing cuts. Additional administration officials, including Vice President JD Vance and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, have joined in advocating for rate reductions.Economists express concern when there is pressure on the Fed to reduce rates solely to decrease government interest payments, as this could compromise the Fed's congressional responsibility to maintain price stability and maximum employment.Trump has expressed dissatisfaction that the Fed maintains rates whilst other global central banks have decreased their borrowing costs, including those in Europe, Canada, and the UK. On Tuesday, the Bank of Japan maintained its short-term rate at 0.5%, following a recent increase.The European Central Bank, Bank of Canada, and Bank of England have implemented rate reductions this year partly due to US tariffs affecting their economies. Meanwhile, the US economy remains predominantly robust, with low unemployment levels.","US Fed has penciled in two rate cuts later this year - a total of 50 basis points cut as per median forecast.

2. Fed Projects Two Rate Cuts in 2025

3. Dollar Shows Weakness

4. Foreign Investors Return

Stock market today: Nifty50 and BSE Sensex , the Indian equity benchmark indices, rallied strongly in trade on Friday. While Nifty50 went above 25,100, BSE Sensex moved up over 1,000 points. Nifty50 ended the day at 25,112.40, up 319 points or 1.29%. BSE Sensex closed at 82,408.17, up 1,046 points or 1.29%.Indian benchmark indices demonstrated a robust recovery on Friday, ending a three-day decline, primarily driven by financial sector gains following the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) revised provisioning guidelines for project financing. The positive momentum, however, faces potential constraints due to ongoing Middle East conflicts.The rally was spearheaded by strong performances in Nifty Bank, Financial Services, Auto, and Metal sectors. The broader market indicators, including Nifty Midcap and Smallcap indices, showed improvement of nearly 0.8% following Thursday's considerable downturn.Additionally, the total market capitalisation of BSE-listed companies increased by Rs 3.57 lakh crore, reaching Rs 446.37 lakh crore, according to an ET report.On Thursday, the RBI issued comprehensive guidelines for project financing, consolidating various existing circulars and standardising regulations across banks, NBFCs, and co-operative banks.""In comparison with the May-2024 draft proposal of 5% standard assets provisioning for under-construction projects, the 1.0%/1.25% provisioning for Infra/CRE projects under the final regulations gives a much-needed breather to project financiers, including REC and PFC,"" Emkay Global's analyst Avinash Singh said.The reduced provisioning requirements are expected to decrease funding expenses for infrastructure and real estate projects, creating advantages for lending institutions.The Federal Reserve maintained current interest rates whilst confirming its forecast of two rate reductions in 2025. Global markets responded favourably to the central bank's indication of future monetary easing, despite elevated inflation projections.The equity markets found solace in the proposed rate cuts, even as the US faces forecasts of reduced GDP growth (1.4%) and higher inflation (3%) for the upcoming year.The dollar index fell to 98.57, following a 0.34% decrease. This weakening typically benefits emerging market equities, including India, as it encourages foreign investment flows and strengthens the rupee.The US 10-year Treasury yield remained stable at 4.389%, whilst the 2-year yield decreased by 2 basis points to 3.925%.Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) have shifted to net purchasing, acquiring equities worth Rs 1,824 crore in the previous two sessions.Domestic institutional investors (DIIs) maintained their robust purchasing pattern for the twelfth straight day, investing Rs 2,566 crore, thereby providing additional market support.","BSE Sensex closed at 82,408.17, up 1,046 points or 1.29%.

(AI image)

Here's the analysis from Jateen Trivedi, VP Research Analyst - Commodity and Currency, LKP Securities:

Gold Price Outlook

From a technical standpoint, the current setup favors a ""Sell on Rise"" strategy around the ₹99,000–₹99,150 levels. Here's why:

Conclusion:

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market and other asset classes given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)

Gold price prediction today: Gold prices have shown a weak trend in the past few days. Where are gold rates headed in the near-term and what should investors of gold do?Gold prices opened with a significant gap-down in the June 20 session, reflecting prevailing weakness in COMEX Gold, and continue to trade with a bearish tone in domestic markets. The MCX Gold August Futures contract (05AUG2025) is currently quoting near ₹98,722 after touching an intraday low of ₹98,705, indicating persistent selling pressure at higher levels.1. EMA Resistance Levels: The 8-period EMA is currently placed at ₹99,150, and the 21-period EMA is at ₹99,350. Prices are trading well below both averages, signaling a clear short-term downtrend. Any intraday pullback toward these levels is likely to attract fresh selling.2. Bollinger Bands: The price action is hugging the lower Bollinger Band, a typical sign of trend continuation in strong bearish momentum. There’s no indication of mean reversion yet, which suggests that rallies may be limited and short-lived.3. Pivot Points: The previous day’s pivot level near ₹99,200–₹99,350 now acts as a key resistance zone.Failure to reclaim this zone reinforces the bearish outlook.4. RSI (14): The Relative Strength Index is hovering near 32.75, which is close to the oversold region but not yet showing signs of bullish divergence. This supports the argument for further weakness before any meaningful reversal.5. MACD: The MACD indicator is strongly negative with the MACD line at -34.71 and the histogram indicating increasing bearish momentum. The signal line remains far below zero, indicating a continuation of the downward trend.6. Price Action & Gap Analysis: Today’s gap-down open confirms a breakdown from the range-bound structure observed between June 17–19. This price gap indicates strong selling interest, likely due to pressure in international gold prices and a firmer dollar index.Traders are advised to follow a Sell on Rise approach as long as prices remain below the ₹99,150–₹99,350 resistance zone. The immediate downside targets lie near ₹98,300 and further lower toward ₹98,000 if the bearish sentiment intensifies. A stop loss can be considered above ₹99,500 to protect against unexpected short-covering rallies.","Gold prices opened with a significant gap-down in the June 20 session, reflecting prevailing weakness in COMEX Gold.

According to Bajaj Broking Research,

are the top stock picks for today. Here’s its view on Nifty, Bank Nifty and the top stock picks for June 20, 2025:

Index View: NIFTY

NIFTY BANK

Bank Nifty continues to consolidate in a range as investors remain on the edge amid intensifying geopolitical tensions in the Middle East.

From a structural standpoint, a sustained breakout and close above the 56,000 psychological marks would be essential to unlock further upside potential, with the index likely to gravitate towards the 56,600–57,000 resistance zone. However, failure to clear this overhead supply zone could result in continued range-bound action, with price oscillating between 56,000 and 55,000, shifting market attention to stock-specific alpha generation.

On the flip side, a decisive break down below the 55,000 levels would negate the ongoing consolidation structure and trigger a corrective move towards the critical support cluster at 54,500–54,000. This zone represents a confluence of the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and the key Fibonacci retracement zone of the prior impulse leg (53,483–57,049).

Stock market recommendations:Paras Defence and Space Technologies, and Thirumalai ChemicalsInvestor sentiment remains fragile amid intensifying geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, which have catalyzed a rally in Brent crude prices. This presents a significant macroeconomic overhang for India, given its substantial reliance on crude imports, thereby casting a shadow over forward earnings visibility for India Inc. Meanwhile, the US Federal Reserve, in its recent policy review, maintained the federal funds rate within the target range of 4.25%–4.50%, aligning with market consensus. The Fed reiterated its forward guidance for 2025, signaling a data-dependent stance with no imminent pivot in sight.On the domestic front, the benchmark index continues to exhibit a phase of time-wise correction, consolidating within a well-demarcated range of 24,400–25,200 for the fifth successive week. The price action suggests a lack of directional conviction, indicative of a range-bound market structure.On the upside, 25,000 remains a critical supply zone. A sustained breakout and close above this resistance threshold could trigger momentum-driven upside towards the upper boundary of the consolidation band at 25,200.However, failure to absorb supply at this level may extend the prevailing sideways trajectory.On the downside, immediate support is situated at 24,700. A decisive breach below this inflection point could intensify selling pressure, potentially dragging the index towards the lower end of the consolidation band in the 24,500–24,400 range.Key support is anchored in the 24,500–24,400 zone, which marks a confluence of the 50-day EMA and the lower boundary of the five-week consolidation range, making it a crucial demand zone for the index. Only a breach below the lower band amid further escalation of geopolitical tension will signal acceleration of the decline towards 24,000 levels.The stock is at the cusp of breaking above the falling trendline joining the highs of May and June 2025 signaling resumption of up move and offers fresh entry opportunity.The stock is currently seen rebounding after a base formation above the 20 days EMA signaling overall positive bias.The daily 14 periods RSI has generated a buy signal moving above its nine periods average thus validating positive bias. We expect the stock to head higher towards 1790 levels in the coming months being the 61.8% retracement of the previous decline (1945-1540).The stock has recently generated a breakout above a rounding formation and is seen sustaining above the short- and medium-term moving averages thus supports the positive bias.The daily MACD is in uptrend and is seen sustaining above its nine periods average signaling positive bias. We expect the stock to head towards 319 levels in the coming months being the 61.8% retracement of the entire decline (395-201).","According to Bajaj Broking Research, these are the top stock picks for today.

The CBDT has already launched online utility for ITR-1 (Sahaj - Available for Individuals & HUF) and ITR-4 (Available for Individuals & HUF with Presumptive Business or Professional Income) with limited enhancements.

However, the new online form ITR-2, ITR-3 for Individual tax-payers is still to be launched. According to Preeti Sharman, it is likely to be more advanced with pre-filled data such as:

Pre-filled Capital Gains schedule – mapping the information received from brokers & Depository Reports and scrip wise bifurcation of capital gain rather than a cumulative amount. Pre-filled Deductions tab, which have been reported by the employer. Update of all the bank account numbers already linked with your PAN and Aadhaar in the Bank’s systems.

This pre-filling of ITR forms has the following advantages:

Minimizing human efforts and errors Full disclosure of income Easy access to past records – for comparison purpose / reporting of previous year’s income / carry forward of previous year’s losses Reduced litigation as any mismatch of details reported in tax return with information available with the tax department is addressed at this stage only. Pre-filled ITRs makes it easier for a taxpayers’ to file ITR correctly without in-depth knowledge of taxation, thereby reducing the dependence on experts (for simple cases).

Income Tax Return Filing FY 2024-25: The Income Tax Department has been aiming to make the e-filing of income tax returns easier for taxpayers, and one such step in that direction is pre-filled ITR forms. If you have been filing tax returns, you would know that the ITR forms have been pre-filed on the tax portal for some years now. With pre-filled ITR forms, the Income Tax Department aims to enhance accuracy, encourage timely filing of income tax returns and reduce compliance burden on taxpayers.The process of filing electronic Income-tax Return forms by taxpayers has evolved over a period of time and we have seen that every year Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) introduces new features in the process to enhance user experience, reduce revenue leakage and ensure full compliance.“The Government has strived to achieve a mature ITR filing process wherein all the information is accurately pre-filled in the form and taxpayers’ role is limited to verification of the information. In order to achieve this level of automation, the CBDT has invested in the technology upgradation, mandated various agencies to share data with CBDT which is filtered and used to prepare a pre-filled ITR,” says Preeti Sharma, Partner, Tax & Regulatory Services, BDO India LLP.Also Read | ITR filing FY 2024-25: Do you need to file your income tax return if TDS has been deducted?

RBI’s jumbo rate cut aims to spur spending & investment,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/rbis-jumbo-rate-cut-aims-to-spur-spending-investment/articleshow/121986076.cms,"RBI

.

MUMBAI: RBI aimed to signal businesses that cheap funds will be available with its double-barrel rate cut earlier this month to boost growth through spending and investment. According to minutes of the monetary policy committee’s meeting, the interest rate cut was triggered by signs that companies were deferring investment plans despite rising capacity utilisation even as inflation was expected to undershoot.Continued uncertainty had pushed top executives into what central bank officials described as a “zone of inaction”. The MPC voted for an unexpected 50-basis-point (100bps = 1 percentage point) cut in the repo rate or the rate at which RBI lends to banks. The MPC also voted to change the policy stance to ‘neutral’ from ‘accommodative’ which RBI governor Sanjay Malhotra said gave it room to “cut, pause or hike rate” depending on evolving conditions.“It is expected that the front-loaded rate action along with certainty on the liquidity front would send a clear signal to economic agents, thereby supporting consumption and investment through lower cost of borrowing,” the governor said in the minutes of the June 6-9 MPC meeting.The meeting also offered a glimpse into the policy stance of deputy governor Poonam Gupta, who joined the central bank in April. Her comments suggest a dovish leaning within the current policy context.Gupta underscored the importance of monetary support for accelerating growth, and said policy must help the economy “attain and even surpass past rates of growth”. She voted for a 50bps cut, citing the need to “foster policy certainty and faster transmission”. She also flagged the possibility of inflation falling below target.Internal member Rajiv Ranjan also backed a 50bps cut, saying the decline in inflation was sharper than expected, giving the central bank room to focus on growth. He said larger cuts in an expansionary phase are often needed to have the same impact on output as smaller hikes during contractionary periods. According to him, front-loading sends a stronger signal and speeds up transmission.“It would be appropriate to provide some certainty on the domestic rate and liquidity front so that agents do not delay and postpone their decisions. Literature suggests that uncertainty plays a role in forming the ‘zone of inaction’,” Ranjan said.",RBI aimed to signal businesses that cheap funds will be available with its double-barrel rate cut earlier this month.

MUMBAI: RBI has eased lending rules for small finance banks (SFBs), allowing them to reduce the share of loans they must give to small loans seekers in priority sectors. Until now, SFBs were required to give 75% of their total loans to these sectors. From this financial year, that requirement has been cut to 60%. Of this, 40% must still go to key target groups identified by RBI. But for the remaining 20%, SFBs can now choose which priority areas to focus on.","Until now, SFBs were required to give 75% of their total loans to these sectors.

DEHRADUN/NEW DELHI: Manoj Sharma doesn't fly by the book in the Kedarnath sector — he flies by sight, by wind, by instinct. ""We are flying in one of the world's most unforgiving regions with very little real-time weather support,"" he said. ""Operations in such large numbers are being conducted on pilot observation and visual reference. The weather is very unpredictable and changes very rapidly.""That reality, long known to those in the cockpit, now has the country's attention. In just six weeks, Uttarakhand has recorded five helicopter accidents — two of them fatal, others involving emergency landings and rotor damage — all on the Kedar route. In one case, a Kestrel Aviation helicopter crash-landed near a road after a mechanical failure, injuring the pilot and damaging a vehicle.This is not an outlier year. In 2022, an Aryan Aviation chopper crashed near Kedarnath, killing seven. In 2023, Uttarakhand Civil Aviation Development Authority (UCADA) finance controller Amit Saini died after being struck by a tail rotor. And in 2013, a military rescue helicopter went down during flood relief, killing 20.The terrain is tough — but it is not the only challenge. The system built to manage it is, in many ways, still catching up to the traffic it supports.Pilgrimage flights have surged over the past decade, but the region lacks a dedicated air traffic control network.""There is no ATC control nor any weather station in these areas,"" said a veteran pilot. ""Flying in the narrow valley from Gaurikund to Kedarnath needs a lot of experience and safety awareness, as there are no landing sites on this stretch that can be used in an emergency or bad weather."" Another pilot added, ""There is no information provided on routes where major helicopter operations take place. Till such time these issues can't be addressed, these operations should immediately be stopped. ""This month, the civil aviation ministry suspended Aryan Aviation from Char Dham operations and grounded two TransBharat pilots who flew in unsuitable weather, suspending their licences for six months.UCADA — established by the state in 2013 to oversee civil aviation development and safety, including helipad infrastructure and coordination with private operators — has been tasked with conducting a comprehensive review with all operators and setting up a command-and-control room to monitor real-time risks. DGCA has deployed officers to oversee safety, airworthiness and the functioning of the control centre.But many in the sector say these moves fall short. ""It seems there are no checks and balances in place,"" said one chopper operator. ""There is someone who replaced one inoperative part on a chopper with another inoperative part from another chopper to show that the part has been changed. Because of unscrupulous operators, conscientious operators and passengers are suffering.""Others point to a deeper culture of pressure and compromise. ""There have been five chopper crashes in the country within the last 1.5 months, which is the worst we have ever seen in helicopter operations in our country,"" said a senior pilot. ""Char Dham operations are one of the toughest... yet we still fly as if nothing needs fixing.""Another pilot was more direct: ""We need a complete stop on chopper operations for this yatra season. All stakeholders — owners, pilots, commercial, engineers, DGCA and UCADA — need to look within and change."" One added, simply, ""It's greed. That's what's driving this. Not safety.""","In just six weeks, Uttarakhand has recorded five helicopter accidents. Two of them fatal, others involving emergency landings and rotor damage.

US Fed rate outlook: Governor Waller signals possible July rate cut; says tariff impact may be ‘one-off’ and shouldn’t delay easing,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-fed-rate-outlook-governor-waller-signals-possible-july-rate-cut-says-tariff-impact-may-be-one-off-and-shouldnt-delay-easing/articleshow/121979362.cms,"A US Federal Reserve official said Friday that the central bank could start cutting interest rates as soon as next month, signaling flexibility amid global economic uncertainty and rising geopolitical risks.“We can start the process of bringing rates down, and then if there's some big shock due to maybe the Middle East conflict, we can pause,” Fed governor Christopher Waller said in an interview with CNBC, AFP reported. “I think we're in that position that we could do this, and as early as July,” he added.The remarks come days after the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) kept the benchmark interest rate unchanged in the range of 4.25–4.50% for the fourth straight time. While President Donald Trump has repeatedly pressed the Fed to cut rates, Chair Jerome Powell said on Wednesday that the central bank would act cautiously, waiting to assess the impact of Trump’s tariffs on inflation and growth.“I think you'd want to start slow,” Waller said. “But start the process, that's the key thing.”Waller argued that central banks should “look through tariff effects on inflation” and instead focus on underlying price trends.Even if the tariffs pushed prices up temporarily, he said, it would likely be a “one-off level effect” that should not result in persistent inflation.His comments highlight a growing divide among Fed policymakers on the path forward. Powell had said Wednesday that while tariff effects could prove temporary, the Fed is “well-positioned to wait to learn more” before considering a shift in policy.Waller also rejected Trump’s recent suggestion that rate cuts could reduce debt-servicing costs. “Our mandate from Congress tells us to worry about unemployment and price stability, and that's what we're doing,” he said, adding, “It does not tell us to provide cheap financing to the US government.”","Christopher Waller, a Fed governor, said the central bank could start cutting interest rates as soon as next month.

Asian equity markets closed on a mixed note Friday while crude oil prices climbed amid mounting geopolitical tension in the Middle East and uncertainty over whether the US will join Israel in its escalating war with Iran.US benchmark crude rose 15 cents to $73.65 a barrel and Brent, the global benchmark, was up 19 cents at $76.89.

Here’s why markets are wary of ‘shadow chair’ signal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/fear-looms-will-donald-trump-name-us-fed-chair-powells-successor-soon-heres-why-markets-are-wary-of-shadow-chair-signal/articleshow/121972446.cms,"AI image

US President Donald Trump has said he will soon announce a successor to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, nearly a year before Powell’s term ends in May 2026 — a move investors warn could destabilise markets if it raises questions about Fed independence.Trump, who reappointed Powell in 2018, has repeatedly criticised the central bank for not cutting interest rates this year. Though he has stepped back from earlier threats to fire Powell, Trump told Reuters this month that a decision on the next Fed chair was coming “soon”.According to a Reuters report, markets are concerned that any premature nomination could create a “shadow chair” dynamic, where two conflicting voices steer monetary policy. “You’re going to have two people trying to steer the ship: One that’s actually steering it, and one that’s the backseat driver,” said Ryan Sweet, chief US economist at Oxford Economics.The central bank’s policy-setting committee has 18 members, but the chair is viewed as its most powerful voice. “Whomever is appointed, the key thing to monitor is whether they are perceived as being a political appointee,” said Eric Winograd, chief US economist at AllianceBernstein.“And by that, I mean someone whose views change with the whims of the president.”Prediction markets have listed names such as White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett, former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, and Judy Shelton, a former Trump nominee, as top contenders. Fed Governor Christopher Waller also ranks high on Kalshi, another online market.The White House and Fed declined to comment. Shelton pointed to her Wall Street Journal op-ed on the Fed, while Warsh did not respond.Callie Cox, chief market strategist at Ritholtz Wealth Management, said, “Any Wall Street manager would tell you that Fed independence is the golden rule of markets. To move away from that can introduce a whole host of issues.”Jason Draho, head of asset allocation Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management, added, “It’s a risk that exists if people are too complacent on how this could all play out.”Powell’s leadership has faced persistent criticism from Trump, who called him a “numbskull” last week over the Fed’s refusal to cut rates again this year. The Fed’s policy rate remains at 4.25%–4.5%, with the last cut of 25 basis points taking place in December 2024.Any new chair must be confirmed by the US Senate, a process that could take months. Alex Grassino, global chief economist at Manulife Investment Management, said the markets would closely monitor any announcement: “You’re sort of setting up an alternate version of what you think policy should be.”“The optimal market reaction to any Fed chair nomination may be none at all,” added Felix Vezina-Poirier, strategist at BCA Research. “No reaction, or a decrease in long-term yields, would be a good sign that the market is digesting the Fed candidate.”Still, some investors believe Trump may wait until Powell’s term nears its end before naming a replacement. “If I were betting, I’d bet other,” said Winograd. “I’d bet the field.”","US President Donald Trump has said he will soon announce a successor to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.

Rare Earth crisis deepens: China’s shipments sink to five-year low; down 74% YoY in May,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/rare-earth-crisis-deepens-chinas-shipments-sink-to-five-year-low-down-74-yoy-in-may/articleshow/121969503.cms,"AI image

China's overseas shipments of rare earth magnets fell sharply in May, dropping to their lowest level in more than five years as export restrictions and heightened customs scrutiny disrupted global supply chains.According to data from the General Administration of Customs, China exported just 1,238 metric tons of rare earth permanent magnets last month, a 52.9% drop from April and the weakest monthly figure since February 2020. Compared to May 2024, shipments were down 74% year-on-year.April’s exports had already halved from March, marking a sustained downward trend that has unsettled industries worldwide, including automotive, aerospace, semiconductors, and military equipment manufacturing, reported Reuters.China, which produces more than 90% of the world’s rare earth magnets, began enforcing restrictions in early April on the export of seven types of medium-to-heavy rare earth products and certain magnets. While the move was intended to assert control over strategic resources, it has created confusion at customs, especially since a single customs code covers a wide range of magnet chemistries.Sources familiar with the situation told Reuters that Chinese customs officials have become increasingly cautious in processing rare earth shipments, particularly those used in appliances and consumer electronics.They added that officials are unsure how to interpret and apply Beijing’s export control rules.China’s ministry of commerce announced Thursday that “a certain number” of export license applications had been approved, though no details were provided. Meanwhile, Chinese producers such as JL MAG Rare-Earth and Innuovo Technology have confirmed recently that they secured limited export licenses for some clients.Despite efforts to ease bottlenecks, overall exports of rare earth magnets for the January-May period stood at 19,132 metric tons, down 14.5% from the same period in 2024, the lowest five-month total since 2021.Earlier this month, Beijing agreed to expedite the export approval process as part of a broader effort to de-escalate trade tensions with the US. However, industry insiders say customs delays and regulatory ambiguity continue to hinder shipments.","China exported just 1,238 metric tons of rare earth permanent magnets last month, a 52.9% drop from April.

Gold and crypto winning the game

Ever since US President Donald Trump took office, five months ago, his economic policies have unleashed widespread volatility across global financial markets, triggering investor pullback, a weakening dollar, and a sharp divergence in global stock performance.Here is a look at the financial roller-coaster rise:After years of dominating global markets, US stocks are now lagging behind — with Europe reaping the gains.Since the start of the year, Wall Street’s S&P 500 index has risen just two percent, while Frankfurt’s main index has surged 16 percent. London and Paris have also outperformed, recording gains of eight and three percent respectively.Kevin Thozet of investment firm Carmignac attributed the underperformance to President Trump’s inconsistent stance on tariffs.Thozet told AFP that the president’s shifting stance on tariffs had fuelled significant uncertainty around how they might affect economic growth.The US dollar has shed 10 percent of its value against the euro over the past six months, its steepest decline in three decades, according to Robert Farago, analyst at British investment firm Hargreaves Lansdown.While President Trump’s tariff policies are seen as the primary driver, mounting concerns over the ballooning US debt, amplified by a costly presidential budget proposal, have further weighed on the currency.Though some have floated the idea of the Chinese yuan as a possible alternative to the dollar, ECB President Christine Lagarde recently highlighted the euro’s potential for a stronger international role.Still, significant hurdles remain for any currency seeking to challenge the dollar’s dominance.American debt has long been seen as a bedrock of the global financial system, with investors worldwide turning to US Treasury bonds as a safe haven.But that confidence is starting to crack. JPMorgan Chase chief Jamie Dimon recently warned that the ballooning US debt is a ""real problem"" and that bond markets are entering a ""tough time.""At the end of May, yields on 30-year US Treasury bonds crossed the key five percent threshold—an indication of waning faith in America's ability to manage its debt.""I've always told clients they need US debt if they want an asset that remains intact even in a disaster, but I think that's no longer the case,"" said Alexandre Hezez, strategist at Banque Richelieu.Adding to the concern, Steve Sosnick of Interactive Brokers noted that the dollar is weakening even as interest rates rise, ""a sign that money is leaving the US.""Donald Trump made lowering oil prices a key priority in his efforts to curb US inflation.In April, crude prices dipped below $60 a barrel, their lowest level since 2021. However, this drop was driven less by policy success and more by market fears. Investors, rattled by Trump’s tariff moves, anticipated a global economic slowdown that would weaken demand.More recently, rising tensions in the Middle East have pushed prices back up. The military escalation between Israel and Iran has driven oil back to around $75 a barrel.Gold has traditionally been seen as the ultimate safe haven during times of uncertainty and 2025 has been no different. Soaring demand has pushed its value up by nearly 30 percent since the start of the year.Much of this rally has been fuelled by major central banks, which are increasingly turning to gold over the US dollar to shore up their reserves.At the same time, Donald Trump has thrown his weight behind cryptocurrencies. Alongside his personal investments, his administration has introduced measures to integrate digital assets more firmly into the financial system.Bitcoin surged past the $100,000 mark for the first time shortly after the US election, capping off a nearly 60 percent gain over the past year.","Since the start of the year, Wall Street’s S&P 500 index has risen just two percent, while Frankfurt’S main index has surged 16 percent.

Global FDI decline: UN warns of declining globalisation; 'Barriers are rising',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/global-fdi-decline-un-warns-of-declining-globalisation-barriers-are-rising/articleshow/121958419.cms,"FDI

United Nations secretary-general Antonio Guterres on Thursday expressed concern over the declining state of globalisation, warning that foreign direct investment (FDI) continues to shrink amid worsening global economic conditions.His remarks came as the UN released fresh data highlighting a negative outlook for international investment flows.In its 2025 World Investment Report, the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) revealed that global FDI dropped by 11 per cent last year, once adjusted for volatile financial flows through several European economies, falling to $1.5 trillion. The downturn follows two consecutive years of decline and is expected to continue into 2025, driven by ongoing geopolitical tensions and tariff disputes.“At a time when the world should be deepening cooperation and expanding opportunity, we are seeing the opposite,” Guterres said.“Barriers are rising. Globalisation is retreating. And the consequences for sustainable development are profound. Rising trade tensions, policy uncertainty and geopolitical divisions risk making the investment environment even worse.,” he further added.UNCTAD attributed the global slide to a 22 per cent fall in FDI to developed economies, with Europe taking the hardest hit, recording a staggering 58 per cent decline.The United States, however, saw a 23 per cent increase, helping North America stand out as an exception.In contrast, FDI inflows to developing countries remained relatively stable, though the broader investment outlook remains fragile.Presenting the findings at a press conference, UNCTAD secretary-general Rebeca Grynspan called the situation “clear and urgent,” warning that global investment remains “weak” and the prospects for this year are “negative.”“The investment landscape in 2024 was shaped by international tensions, trade fragmentation, and intensifying industrial policy competition,” she said. These factors are “eroding long-term investor confidence.”Although trade showed early signs of recovery in 2023 after the pandemic years, Grynspan said that renewed uncertainty—particularly stemming from the renewed trade war initiated by former US President Donald Trump in April—has “killed that possibility for 2025.”“The problem that we have is that we don't see an end,” she added.The findings come at a time when global economic cooperation appears increasingly strained, with the ripple effects of protectionist policies threatening to undermine progress toward sustainable development goals.","Global FDI dropped by 11 per cent last year, once adjusted for volatile financial flows through several European economies.

US President Donald Trump once again slammed Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, accusing him of costing the country hundreds of billions of dollars after the central bank kept the interest rates unchanged.

He is truly one of the dumbest, and most destructive, people in Government, and the Fed Board is complicit,"" Trump posted on Truth social.Trump expressed frustration after the Fed chose to keep interest rates unchanged, despite European countries implementing multiple rate cuts. He argued that the US should have already reduced rates by 2.5 points to save billions on short-term debt, highlighting the country’s low inflation as justification for the cuts.""Europe has had 10 cuts, we have had none. We should be 2.5 Points lower, and save $BILLIONS on all of Biden’s Short Term Debt. We have LOW inflation! TOO LATE’s an American Disgrace!"" Trump noted.He had earlier called Powell a “real dummy” and claimed he was ""costing America billions.""Trump also shared an article in which an investor argued Powell should resign immediately if he failed to cut short-term interest rates, saying the Fed’s slow actions were hurting the housing market and that inflation had dropped enough to justify a rate cut.The US Federal Reserve decided to keep its benchmark interest rate unchanged for the fourth straight meeting, sticking with a range between 4.25% and 4.50%.Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank was in no rush to act and would monitor inflation trends and the impact of Trump's new tariffs over the summer. “We'll make smarter and better decisions if we just wait a couple of months,” Powell said, suggesting a cautious stance given the mixed economic signals.The Fed also revised its outlook—cutting its 2025 growth forecast from 1.7% to 1.4%, and raising inflation expectations to 3% and the unemployment rate to 4.5%.From “stupid” to “worst ever.”Trump's criticism of Powell is not new. In the past, Trump has publicly attacked the Fed chairman, including calling him “stupid” just before the rates were announced.Trump has suggested that cutting rates will lower the interest America pays on its debt—an argument critics say overlooks the inflationary risks of such moves.The Fed noted that Trump’s sweeping 10% tariffs on major trading partners were likely to increase inflation and slow growth.Powell added that the full effects were still unclear and may not be visible for several months.

Global oil supply: Iran may use threat of closing Strait of Hormuz as leverage only; analysts say markets remain in surplus,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/global-oil-supply-iran-may-use-threat-of-closing-strait-of-hormuz-as-leverage-only-analysts-say-markets-remain-in-surplus/articleshow/121957332.cms,"Representative image

Iran has repeatedly warned of blocking the Strait of Hormuz, a narrow yet strategically crucial maritime chokepoint for global oil supply, however, the country has not yet shut it down.Analysts say that the vital passage has never been shut down and Iran is using this threat as a diplomatic lever and that the chances of an actual shutdown are slim. Additionally, global oil markets are also well prepared to absorb any geopolitical shock from the region.""Iran has threatened to close the Strait of Hormuz numerous times in the past but has never followed through, as doing so would be strategically and economically self-defeating,"" said Hitesh Jain, strategist for institutional equities research at Yes Securities.The Strait, which lies between Iran and the Arabian Peninsula, is the main passage for oil exports from Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait and the UAE. It also serves as a key route for liquefied natural gas (LNG) shipments from Qatar. Roughly 20% or one fifth of global oil and a significant share of global LNG passes through this narrow waterway. Over a third of India’s energy needs also travel through the passage.Jain noted that oil markets remain well-supplied, pointing to OPEC’s spare capacity of 4 million barrels per day and a pre-conflict global surplus of 0.9 million bpd as key buffers.The growing strength of US shale production, he added, further boosted the market’s resilience.Rating agency ICRA echoed the sentiment but added a note of caution, suggesting that crude prices may average to $70-80 per barrel for the current fiscal year.“A sustained flare-up in the conflict poses upside risks for our estimates of crude oil prices, and consequently of net oil imports and the current account deficit (CAD). A $10 per barrel increase in the average price of crude oil for the fiscal will typically push up net oil imports by $13-14 billion during the year, enlarging the CAD by 0.3 per cent of GDP.”India is heavily reliant on imported energy, with over 85% of its crude oil and around half of its natural gas needs coming from abroad, PTI reported.Imports from Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the UAE, most of which pass through the Strait, account for 40–45% of India’s oil supply. Roughly 60% of its LNG imports also transit through the same channel.Jain added that the global energy landscape has evolved significantly. Since 2008, the rise of US shale has enhanced global supply and flexibility, allowing markets to absorb geopolitical shocks with only short-lived price spikes. Meanwhile, OPEC’s reduced market share and increased spare capacity, largely from Saudi Arabia and the UAE—have helped keep volatility in check.On the demand side, China’s weak post-COVID recovery and the global shift towards electric vehicles (EVs), improved fuel efficiency, and greener policies are slowing oil demand in OECD countries. “Given this backdrop, Brent crude is unlikely to sustain levels above $80 per barrel in a durable way unless the Strait of Hormuz is closed, or critical Gulf infrastructure is targeted,” Jain noted.The International Energy Agency (IEA) and US Energy Information Administration (EIA) have both trimmed their 2025 global oil demand growth forecastsby 0.2-0.28 million barrels per day.Still, ICRA cautioned that regional risks remain. Iran currently produces about 3.3 million barrels of crude oil per day, of which 1.8–2.0 million bpd is exported. “While Iranian oil and gas facilities have reportedly been attacked, the extent of damage is not clear. However, any disruption of Iranian production and supplies or a wider regional conflict impacting other large producers in the region could push energy prices higher. ”“At these elevated crude oil prices, while the profitability of upstream players will remain healthy and their capex plans will remain intact, the marketing margins of downstream players will be impacted along with the expansion of LPG under-recoveries” the rating agency added.","Iran has threatened to close the Strait of Hormuz numerous times in the past but has never followed through.

The firm suggested the hackers had “effectively burned the funds in order to send Nobitex a political message,” rather than profiting from the theft.The group also accused Nobitex of helping Iran’s government circumvent Western sanctions and funnel money to militant groups, including Hamas and Yemen's Houthis. In a statement posted on X, Predatory Sparrow claimed the platform had played a role in supporting Tehran’s nuclear programme and militant proxies.Nobitex appeared to confirm the breach, saying it was investigating “unauthorised access” to its systems. Its website and app remained offline on Tuesday.Andrew Fierman, head of national security intelligence at Chainalysis, described the hack as “particularly significant given the comparatively modest size of Iran’s cryptocurrency market.”The cyberattack follows a fresh wave of escalations between Israel and Iran, sparked last week when Israeli forces reportedly struck nuclear and military targets in Iran, triggering retaliatory missile attacks. The hack also came just days after Predatory Sparrow claimed to have wiped data from Bank Sepah, a major Iranian state-run lender.Elliptic further alleged that associates of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei had ties to the Nobitex platform, and that sanctioned Revolutionary Guard operatives used it for financial transactions.While Israeli outlets have repeatedly linked Predatory Sparrow to Israel’s intelligence services, the Israeli government has never officially acknowledged any connection.Last year, US Senators Elizabeth Warren and Angus King voiced concerns over Iran’s use of cryptocurrencies as a tool to bypass international sanctions.","Hackers with suspected links to Israel have stolen over $90 million from Iran's largest cryptocurrency exchange.

NEW DELHI: Russia’s economy minister Maxim Reshetnikov made a rare admission on Thursday, warning that the country’s economy is “on the brink of going into a recession”, even as top Kremlin officials attempted to project calm at the nation’s most prominent economic summit, according to Russian media reports.Speaking at the St Petersburg International Economic Forum, a high-profile event intended to showcase Russia’s economic strength and attract global investors, Reshetnikov cautioned that current data signals a worrying slowdown.“The numbers indicate cooling, but all our numbers are (like) a rearview mirror,” Reshetnikov was quoted as saying by Russian business outlet RBC. “Judging by the way businesses currently feel and the indicators, we are already, it seems to me, on the brink of going into a recession.”The comments come amid mounting pressure on Russia’s war-fueled economy, which has defied earlier predictions of collapse under Western sanctions. High military spending has kept growth alive and unemployment low, even as inflation surges. Wage hikes and recruitment bonuses for soldiers, along with death payouts, have injected cash into poorer regions, keeping demand steady.Still, economists warn that Russia’s militarized economy is dangerously unbalanced.With foreign investment drying up and growth largely confined to defense sectors, the risk of long-term stagnation looms large.Reshetnikov was blunt: “Going forward, it all depends on our decisions.”But other officials at the forum struck a more optimistic tone. Finance Minister Anton Siluanov admitted the economy was “cooling,” but brushed off concerns by saying, “After any cooling, the summer always comes.” Meanwhile, Central Bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina insisted the economy was simply “coming out of overheating.”",Russia’s economy minister Maxim Reshetnikov made a rare admission on Thursday.

Huge FIREBALL As Iranian Missile Dodges Iron Dome, Explodes In Between Tel Aviv Skyscrapers

The Tel Aviv Stock Exchange building reportedly suffered extensive damage on Thursday after being struck by an Iranian ballistic missile, marking one of the most direct attacks on Israel's economic infrastructure since hostilities erupted.The strike was part of a wider Iranian missile barrage that targeted multiple locations across Israel, including Tel Aviv and Be’er Sheva, as per Al Jazeera and local media reports.The attack marks a significant escalation on the seventh day of direct conflict between the two long-time rivals.“This morning, Iran's terrorist dictators fired missiles at Soroka Hospital in Beer Sheva and at civilians in the centre of the country,” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on X. “We will make the tyrants in Tehran pay a heavy price,” he added, condemning the strikes on civilian infrastructure, including the hospital and the stock exchange.According to Israel's Magen David Adom emergency service, at least 47 people were injured during the attacks, with 18 more hurt while rushing to bomb shelters.Soroka Hospital in Be’er Sheva suffered a direct hit. The hospital director confirmed “several wards were completely demolished and there is extensive damage across the medical centre,” reported AFP.Iran, on its part, said its missiles were aimed at Israeli military and intelligence installations. Iranian state media reported the operation was part of “True Promise 3,” launched in retaliation for Israel’s “Operation Rising Lion”—a series of strikes on Iranian nuclear and military targets that began on June 13. On Thursday, Israel responded by targeting Iran’s Arak heavy water reactor. Iranian state television said the facility had been evacuated and that “there is no radiation danger whatsoever. ”The strikes on Tel Aviv and Be’er Sheva came as tensions reached a boiling point following Israel’s repeated attacks on Iranian nuclear infrastructure, including recent airstrikes on over 20 military and nuclear sites across Tehran, Natanz, and Arak.According to CNN, the Israeli Air Force deployed 60 fighter jets to strike centrifuge production and R&D sites linked to Iran’s nuclear weapons programme.The missile that hit the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange comes as both countries continue to exchange daily barrages. An Israeli military official, quoted by AFP, said that since the conflict began, Iran has launched around 400 ballistic missiles and 1,000 drones. Of these, around 20 missiles have landed in civilian areas of Israel, the official said.Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump has hinted at possible intervention but stopped short of confirming any military action. “I may do it, I may not do it,” he told reporters. “I like to make the final decision one second before it’s due, because things change. Especially with war.”Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has dismissed US demands, saying: “This nation will never surrender,” and warned of “irreparable damage” if the US intervenes.Both nations continue to count mounting casualties. As of the last official update, at least 24 Israelis had been killed and hundreds wounded, according to Netanyahu’s office. Iran said over 220 people, including military commanders and civilians, had died from Israeli strikes, though neither side has released updated figures since.","The Tel Aviv Stock Exchange building reportedly suffered extensive damage on Thursday after being struck by an Iranian ballistic missile.

While the UK may escape the worst of those tariffs, the wider global economic outlook remains uncertain.On Wednesday, US Federal Reserve had also kept rates unchanged, despite pressure from Trump to cut borrowing costs.Since August last year, the Bank of England has trimmed rates every three months from a peak of 5.25%, suggesting the next cut may come in August — if economic conditions allow.","The Bank of England is expected to keep interest rates unchanged on Thursday.

"‘Fundamentally well supplied..’: Brent crude prices expected to average $70 in FY26 despite Israel-Iran conflict, says report",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/fundamentally-well-supplied-brent-crude-prices-expected-to-average-70-in-fy26-despite-israel-iran-conflict-says-report/articleshow/121949211.cms,"Representative image (Picture credit: ANI)

Brent crude oil prices are projected to average around $70 per barrel in FY26 despite geopolitical turbulence in the Middle East, according to a report by Emkay Research.The agency said oil markets remain “fundamentally well supplied,” citing rising output from both OPEC+ and non-OPEC+ producers as key factors stabilising prices.“We continue to assume Brent price at USD70/bbl for FY26. Fundamentally, oil markets are well supplied with rising production,” the report said. This outlook comes despite a recent spike in prices caused by Israel's attack on Iranian nuclear infrastructure, which triggered a sharp 12–13 per cent surge in Brent to nearly $80 per barrel.Prices have since moderated to around $75 per barrel, even as tensions remain high. Iran retaliated with missile attacks on Israeli cities, while Israel has ramped up its operations. Yet, according to Emkay, unless key energy infrastructure suffers sustained damage, as witnessed during the Russia-Ukraine war, markets are likely to remain stable.As per the news agency ANI, the report further noted that a ceasefire could potentially drive Brent prices even lower, possibly below the $70 threshold.“The market is well buffered by existing inventory levels,” Emkay noted, adding that a steady supply outlook would help limit long-term inflationary pressure.The report also flagged limited but notable disruptions. Iran has partially shut its South Pars gas field following Israeli airstrikes. While domestic supplies have been impacted, the wider global market response has been restrained. In contrast, Israel suspended operations at two of its gas fields supplying Egypt and Jordan.Spot LNG prices have climbed to $13.5/mmbtu, up from $12 before the conflict began.As per news agency PTI, while Iran exports up to 2 million barrels per day, about 2 per cent of global supply, its long-standing sanctions mean much of that oil is already being sold at a discount to buyers like China.Additionally, OPEC’s spare capacity remains unusually high, with over 4 million barrels per day in reserve, primarily from Saudi Arabia and the UAE. The IEA also maintains over 1.2 billion barrels in strategic reserves across OECD nations.Despite the Middle East tensions, demand remains tepid. China's industrial slowdown and its reduced refinery output in May, down 1.8 per cent year-on-year, have softened consumption. The IEA also predicts global supply in 2025 will surpass demand by nearly 1.8 million barrels per day, leaving room for further price cushioning.On the corporate front, Emkay believes that while both upstream producers and oil marketing companies (OMCs) remain within a “safe zone” at current price levels, OMCs offer more attractive valuations and better risk-reward potential.However, the gas market could face pressure. The early onset of monsoons in South Asia has already reduced demand, and Emkay warns of continued volatility in the sector.Globally, the risks of escalation remain real. If Iran decides to shut down the Strait of Hormuz, through which nearly 20 million barrels of oil transit daily, global prices could surge. While alternate pipelines through Saudi Arabia and the UAE exist, insurance and freight costs have already jumped nearly 60 per cent since hostilities began.","Brent crude oil prices are projected to average around $70 per barrel in FY26.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor ( CEA ) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

Indian benchmark indices witnessed heightened volatility during the last week, with markets trading under a persistent downward bias. The negative momentum was primarily influenced by weak global cues and sustained selling by Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs). Volatility remained elevated throughout the week due to prevailing global uncertainties, particularly concerns surrounding US trade tariff policies and geopolitical issues related to Greenland. These factors contributed to cautious investor sentiment and limited risk appetite across equity markets. Additionally, the Indian rupee came under significant pressure, with USD/INR hitting a fresh record low of 91.74. The sharp depreciation of the domestic currency further weighed on market sentiment, adding to the downside pressure on benchmark indices.Geopolitical tensions eased somewhat during the latter half of the week following developments at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. President Donald Trump stated that a framework plan had been finalized to address US interests in Greenland, thereby reducing the likelihood of imposing additional tariffs on European nations that had previously opposed the proposed annexation of the Arctic island.The proposed framework is expected to include US mineral rights in Greenland as well as the deployment of the “Golden Dome,” a multi-layered missile defense system designed to enhance US national security.Nifty is forming a sizable bearish candle with a long lower shadow in the weekly chart and is currently placed around 200 days EMA placed around 25170 levels. Buying demand during the week has emerged near the key support zone of 25,000–24,800. This area aligns with the prior breakout level and the lower band of the rising channel on the weekly timeframe.Following a sharp 1,400-point decline over just 12 sessions, the index has entered extreme oversold territory on the daily chart. A technical pullback appears likely in the near term, with immediate resistance hurdles at 25,400-25,500.Post the recent sharp decline. We expect some consolidation within the 25,500–24,800 range. Only a move above 25500 will open further upside towards the major breakdown area of 25,700.Bank Nifty continues to outperform the Nifty, displaying clear relative strength as it continues to consolidate in the range of 58700-60400.The 58,700–59,000 zone remains a key short-term support. Although the index briefly dipped to 58,278.6 on Wednesday session, it did not close near the lows, indicating buying interest at lower levels. This area also coincides with the lower end of the seven-week consolidation range and the 50-day EMA, making it a crucial support.A decisive break below this zone could accelerate the downside towards 57500-58,000. On the upside, resistance is placed around the previous all-time high of 60,200–60,400.Stock is seen rebounding after a base at the trendline support joining previous major highs signaling a Change of Polarity.On the downside key support is placed at 570-560 levels being the confluence of the bullish gap area of Thursday and key retracement of last 2 sessions pullback.We expect the stock to head towards 645 levels being the recent breakdown area.The stock has generated a breakout above a falling trendline joining highs of the last 2 months signaling resumption of up move and offers fresh entry opportunity.On the downside key support is placed at 2300-2270 levels being the presence of recent trendline support and key retracement of the recent up move.We expect the stock to head towards 2520 levels being the 61.8% retracement of the previous major decline (2750-2245).","Indian benchmark indices witnessed heightened volatility during the last week, with markets trading under a persistent downward bias.

Stock market today: Indian equity benchmarks, Nifty50 and BSE Sensex , opened flat in trade on Friday. While Nifty50 was near 25,250, BSE Sensex was down 50 points. At 9:17 AM, Nifty50 was trading at 25,263.15, down 27 points or 0.11%. BSE Sensex was at 82,257.49, down 50 points or 0.061%.Analysts are of the view that the stock market will take cues from global trends, key macroeconomic signals and the ongoing quarterly earnings season on Friday, with results due from companies such as JSW Steel, Shriram Finance, BPCL, Godrej Consumer, Cipla, MCX and Piramal Finance.Dr. VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Investments Limited says, “The pattern of sustained FII selling and DII buying which dominated the market trend in 2025 has been continuing in 2026, too, so far. Whether this pattern will change with FIIs also turning buyers is the important question which investors have been asking for sometime now. Partly, the Budget to be presented on February 1st will offer some insights, if there are some market-friendly proposals. ”“More importantly, the FII stance towards India will be determined by the trend in India’s corporate earnings. Higher earnings growth alone can ensure sustained buying by FIIs since they have the option to invest in other markets where valuations are cheaper and earnings are better.Since earnings growth is sometime away and the FII selling strategy is expected to continue, preempting any healthy rally, the market is heavily net short. FIIs are adding to the short positions on every rally triggered by some positive news. The broader market, where FII presence is limited, is likely to witness action in response to Q3 results.""Wall Street ended higher on Thursday for a second consecutive session as investor sentiment improved after US President Donald Trump withdrew tariff threats against European allies, while economic data underscored the resilience of the American economy.

US Claims PM Modi ‘didn’t call’; MEA Rebuts

India-US trade deal: US President Donald Trump on Wednesday said that America would have a ‘great’ trade deal with India. Trump’s statement came during his visit to the World Economic Forum (WEF) that is being held at Davos in Switzerland.Speaking to Moneycontrol on the sidelines of the WEF, Trump praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi and expressed confidence in an India-US trade deal. “I have great respect for your Prime Minister. He’s a fantastic man and a friend of mine. We are going to have a good deal,” Trump was quoted as saying. Trump had earlier delivered an over one hour long speech at WEF.Trump’s remarks come at a time when the US has imposed 50% tariffs on India - which is among the highest in the world. While both countries have reiterated that trade talks and negotiations continue, a deal still remains elusive. Of the 50% tariffs, 25% are for India's crude oil imports from Russia, something that the Trump administration claims helps fund the Russian war against Ukraine.Meanwhile, earlier this month, US Ambassador to India Sergio Gor assumed charge and expressed confidence in India-US ties. Sergio Gor voiced strong support for the ongoing trade negotiations, saying both countries are firmly committed to reaching an agreement.While describing the bond between Trump and PM Modi as genuine, Gor said the US president could visit India “hopefully in the next year or two”.He said the India-US relationship rests not only on shared interests but also on engagement at the highest political levels, adding that true partners may differ at times but ultimately resolve their disagreements.“Remember, India is the world's largest nation, so it's not an easy task to get this across the finish line, but we are determined to get there. And while trade is very important for our relationship, we will continue to work closely together on other very important areas such as security, counterterrorism, energy, technology, education, and health,” he added.Gor praised PM Modi, calling him an exceptional leader. “I was with the President…and as we had dinner right after New Year's, he recounted his incredible experience visiting here and also his great friendship with the great Prime Minister of India, Prime Minister Modi,” said Gor, who previously served as a close aide to Trump. “I've traveled all over the world with President Trump, and I can attest that his friendship with Prime Minister Modi is real,” he added.At the same time, earlier this month, US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick claimed that the India-US trade deal failed to materialise because PM Modi did not place a call to Donald Trump. The Ministry of External Affairs, however, said the description of events was inaccurate and reaffirmed India’s willingness to pursue a trade pact that delivers benefits to both sides.Lutnick had said on a podcast that India had “missed the train” by not reaching out to Trump within a three-week window, unlike leaders from several other countries.Responding to the remarks, MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said India and the United States had been engaged in discussions on a bilateral trade agreement since February 13 last year and had repeatedly come close to finalising a deal.“We have seen the remarks. India and the US were committed to negotiating a bilateral trade agreement with the US as far back as Feb 13 last year… On several occasions, we have been close to a deal… We remain interested in a mutually beneficial trade deal between two complementary economies and look forward to concluding it,” he said.India and the US have held five rounds of official-level talks since negotiations began last February, alongside discussions at the ministerial level. Jaiswal also noted that Prime Minister Modi and President Trump had spoken by phone eight times in 2025, covering a broad range of issues linked to the bilateral partnership.",US President Donald Trump on Wednesday said that America would have a ‘great’ trade deal with India.

Founder steps back from execution, not ownership



Brokerages back the move, flag execution risks



Blinkit at the centre of growth strategy



Billionaire founder Deepinder Goyal has relinquished over Rs 1,000 crore worth of unvested employee stock options (ESOPs) at Eternal, marking one of the most significant founder-led governance moves seen in India’s listed internet sector in recent years.The decision comes alongside a leadership transition at the food delivery and quick-commerce major, with Goyal stepping down as Group CEO and moving into the role of Vice Chairman, while Blinkit chief Albinder Dhindsa takes charge of day-to-day operations as Group CEO.As part of the transition, 3.3 crore unvested shares held by Goyal will revert to Eternal’s ESOP pool, expanding it by about 16%. Analysts say the move strengthens the company’s ability to retain and reward talent without near-term shareholder dilution, a key consideration as competition intensifies in the fast-scaling quick-commerce space.“Mr. Goyal's decision to return unvested ESOPs (> INR 10bn) sets a very high bar for corporate governance,” Abhisek Banerjee of ICICI Securities said, ET reported.At the end of the December quarter, Goyal held a 3.83% stake in Eternal. According to Forbes, his net worth is estimated at around $1.6 billion, underscoring that his personal wealth remains closely linked to the company’s long-term performance.Eternal’s management said the founder’s move provides meaningful flexibility on equity incentives.Speaking during a conference call, CFO Akshant Goyal said the company’s ESOP pool already comprises more than 20 crore shares, with Goyal’s surrendered options adding another 3.3 crore shares.“His (Deepinder’s) ESOPs will perhaps expand that pool by another 3.3 crore shares,” the CFO said, adding that ESOP grants continue to be based on employee performance rather than pool size.He also indicated that the move could push back the need for further equity dilution. “Just because the pool size went up, we may not need to dilute for ESOPs again for slightly longer than what we would have done otherwise. We don't think we need any dilution in the near future at this point,” he said.In a letter to shareholders, Goyal said his decision reflects a growing pull towards pursuing ideas that carry significantly higher risk and uncertainty — ventures he believes are better undertaken outside the constraints of a listed company.“Of late, I have found myself drawn to a set of new ideas that involve significantly higher-risk exploration and experimentation,” he wrote. “These are the kinds of ideas that are better pursued outside a public company like Eternal. The expectations, legal and otherwise, of a public company CEO in India demand singular focus.”Goyal stressed that the transition does not dilute his commitment to Eternal’s future. “My financial future remains meaningfully tied to Eternal, and my incentives remain aligned with long-term shareholder value creation. As part of this transition, all of my unvested ESOPs will revert to the ESOP pool,” he said.While operational authority shifts to Dhindsa, Goyal said his role will continue to centre on long-term strategy, leadership development and governance. “While the centre of gravity for operating decisions moves to Albi, my involvement in long-term strategy, culture, leadership development, and ethics and governance, continues,” he wrote.Brokerages largely welcomed the leadership change, pointing to Dhindsa’s track record at Blinkit, which has emerged as Eternal’s fastest-growing business.Karan Taurani of Elara Capital said Goyal’s move to Vice Chairman “augurs well” for the company, as it combines founder oversight with operational execution by a seasoned operator. JM Financial said the elevation of Dhindsa is central to Eternal’s growth strategy, noting his role in scaling Blinkit from acquisition to breakeven.However, some analysts cautioned that clarity around governance and execution will be critical in the near term. Motilal Oswal flagged that “the division of responsibilities between management and the board remains unclear as of now,” adding that the change “does introduce some uncertainty to the business.”Nomura stressed that “a smooth transition without any slippage on execution is critical,” while Vivek Maheshwari of Jefferies described the move as “change but no change,” noting that management has clarified there will be no major operational shift in the immediate future.Dhindsa will continue to lead Blinkit while assuming broader Group CEO responsibilities. Goyal credited him with building the quick-commerce platform’s operating muscle.“Blinkit's journey from acquisition to breakeven happened under his leadership,” Goyal wrote. “He built the team, the culture, the supply chain, the operating rhythm. He has the DNA of a battle-hardened founder and his ability to execute far exceeds mine.”Despite stepping back from daily management, Goyal said his ambitions for Eternal remain unchanged. “I want Eternal to become India's most valuable company. I want us to serve a billion customers. I want us to create the most positive impact on society. I want us to be the source of livelihoods for millions of Indians.”From what Goyal once described as “a menu scanning company,” Eternal has evolved into a consumer internet major with a market capitalisation of about Rs 2.7 lakh crore, serving millions of households daily and supporting hundreds of thousands of livelihoods","Billionaire founder Deepinder Goyal relinquishes over Rs 1,000 crore worth of unvested employee stock options (ESOPs) at Eternal.

MUMBAI: India's bank depositor remains the predominant source of credit to the commercial sector, but their relative contribution is steadily declining as credit growth outpaces deposit mobilisation, data for Dec 2025 show.As of Dec 2025, total outstanding credit to the commercial sector (bank and non-bank) rose to Rs 297.9 lakh crore, while bank deposits stood at Rs 249 lakh crore. Deposits were sufficient to fund only about 83% of the total credit outstanding. A year earlier, in Dec 2024, bank deposits amounted to Rs 220.6 lakh crore against total credit of Rs 259.01 lakh crore, covering around 85% of credit demand. The data point to a widening gap between credit expansion and deposit growth in the banking system.The trend reveals a structural shift in India's credit landscape. Banks remain central to financing the commercial sector, but their deposit base is no longer keeping pace with the demand for credit. The growing reliance on NBFCs, bond markets and foreign borrowings reflects both deeper financial markets and mounting pressure on bank balance sheets as credit demand continues to surge.The first nine months of 2025-26 saw a sharp acceleration in credit flow to the commercial sector.While banks continue to anchor the system, the pace of credit creation has increasingly relied on non-bank channels.Non-food bank credit remained the single largest source of incremental funding. Between Dec 2024 and Dec 2025, bank credit expanded by Rs 25.5 lakh crore, accounting for 65.5% of the total increase in commercial sector credit. Outstanding non-food bank credit stood at Rs 202.3 lakh crore at end-Dec 2025, reflecting a year-on-year growth of 14.4%.","As of Dec 2025, total outstanding credit to the commercial sector (bank and non- bank) rose to Rs 297.9 lakh crore.

NEW DELHI: The US Securities and Exchange Commission has asked a US court for permission to personally email summons to Indian billionaire Gautam Adani and group executive Sagar Adani over alleged fraud and a $265 million bribery scheme, filings show.India, the SEC said, has previously refused two requests to serve the summons. In the most high-profile legal case in the U.S. involving an Indian conglomerate, the SEC has been trying to send summons to Adani group founder Gautam Adani and his nephew Sagar since last year.Adani group has called the allegations ""baseless"" and said that it would seek ""all possible legal recourse"" to defend itself. It did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for comment on the latest SEC filing, dated January 21. In the response to the New York court, the US markets regulator said it ""does not expect service to be completed"" through the current route and should be allowed to directly email the summons to the Adani group executives. India's law ministry also did not immediately respond to a Reuters' request seeking comment on the latest filing. It has previously described the issue as a legal issue between private firms and the United States.The two rejections by India to serve the summons, the SEC filing said, were based on procedural reasons, such as signature and seal requirements, none of which it said is needed in summons sent to individuals in another country under the international treaties of the Hague Convention. In its second rejection in December last year, the court filing added that India's law ministry appeared to raise doubts about the SEC's authority to request service of summons.","US Securities and Exchange Commission has asked a US court for permission to personally email summons to Indian billionaire Gautam Adani and group executive Sagar Adani.

How labour codes impact salaries & social security,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/how-labour-codes-impact-salaries-social-security/articleshow/127192781.cms,"Image: IANS

.

(The writer is tax partner, EY India. Views expressed are personal)

India's transition to a new labour law framework has triggered one of the biggest shifts in how salaries are paid and how statutory benefits are calculated. With the four labour codes coming into force on Nov 21, 2025, India has moved to a unified labour framework, and at the heart of this reform is a single, standardised definition of ""wages,"" which now applies for all statutory benefits governed by these codes.To understand why this matters, it helps to look at how salaries are typically paid in India. Most employers follow a Cost-to-Company (CTC) structure, where salary is distributed across basic salary, various allowances along with the option for employees to opt for tax-efficient reimbursements for travel expenses, telephone and internet expenses, fuel expenses and similar items.The new labour codes reshape this structure by clearly defining what counts as ""wages"" for the purpose of various statutory benefits. Under the codes, wages cover all salary components (including basic pay, dearness allowance and retaining allowance) excluding specific components listed in the definition of wages. If excluded components exceed 50% of total pay, the excess must be added back to wages for statutory calculations.The excluded list in the definition of wages covers items such as house rent allowance, conveyance allowance, the employer's share of provident fund contributions, housing accommodation, utilities such as light and water, medical attendance provided by the employer, and other specific components.The definition also empowers the appropriate govt to specify additional amenities or services to be excluded from wages through general or special orders.The new wage definition has major implications for social security. Key benefits such as gratuity and leave encashment are now to be calculated based on the revised wage definition. However, employees and employers may continue contributing PF at 12% of basic salary so long as the basic salary exceeds Rs 15,000 (wage ceiling under the PF Scheme), even if the wages under the labour codes are higher.The new wage definition also interacts closely with India's two income tax regimes. Since wages exclude specific allowances, employees may continue receiving components such as house rent allowance (HRA) and leave travel concession (LTC) without these forming part of wages, and such allowances may continue to offer tax benefits under the old tax regime, subject to the relevant eligibility rules. Similarly, the revised draft central rules confirm that telephone and internet reimbursements and the value of meal vouchers remain excluded from wages. These may continue to offer tax exemptions under the old tax regime, while telephone and internet reimbursements remain eligible for exemption under the new tax regime as well. This provides employees with some relief, because although the wage definition tightens the structure of compensation, several tax-efficient allowances remain available.An important safeguard in the transition to the new system is Section 124 of the Code on Social Security (COSS). This provision states that no employer shall, solely because of its liability to make contributions under the Code, reduce an employee's wages or the total quantum of benefits to which the employee is entitled under the terms of employment, whether express or implied.Taken together, the new wage definition in the labour codes represents a significant reorganisation of India's compensation system. Employers may now need to frame salary packages so that at least half of an employee's gross salary falls within the wage definition. The CTC framework will continue, but the internal mix of basic pay, allowances and reimbursements will become more regulated and transparent.","India's transition to a new labour law framework has triggered one of the biggest shifts in how salaries are paid and how statutory benefits are calculated. With the four labour codes coming into force on Nov 21, 2025, India has moved to a unified labour framework. At the heart of this reform is a single, standardised definition of ""wages""","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127193129,imgsize-588259,width-400,resizemode-4/image-ians.jpg"
IndiGo profit dives 78% in December quarter over flight disruptions,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/indigo-profit-dives-78-in-december-quarter-over-flight-disruptions/articleshow/127192005.cms,"PTI file photo

NEW DELHI: IndiGo net profit fell 78% to Rs 549 crore in the tumultuous Dec quarter due to flight disruption and provisions for higher gratuity and leave encashment as mandated by the labour code.IndiGo CEO Pieter Elbers, who has been issued a warning by aviation regulator for the airline's failure to plan for crew flying timing requirements, said the operational issues cost the carrier Rs 577 crore, while the impact of the labour code was around Rs 1,000 crore, with the rupee devaluation also having an impact. The airline had reported a profit of Rs 2,449 crore during Oct-Dec 2024.Despite the large-scale disruptions in early Dec, fare caps being enforced for domestic flights since Dec 6 and the airline's 10% flights cut for this winter schedule, the largest domestic carrier saw its total income rise 6.7% to Rs 24,541 crore in the third quarter of the current fiscal year. IndiGo stock closed 1.1% up at Rs 4,914 on BSE on Thursday, when the broader market was 0.5% up. During 2025, IndiGo flew 12.4 crore passengers, 9% more than 2024, Elbers said.According to govt data, IndiGo had cancelled a fourth of the 17,404 domestic flights it was to operate between Dec 1 and 9 (both days included). On other hand, just a shade over 2% of the 2,702 international flights it was to operate at the same time were cancelled. So far there is now word on why the airline did so. Asked when he sees returning to pre-cut levels, Elbers said: ""We are ambitious of returning to not just that level but growing further in coming times.

Gold price prediction

today:

are touching new record highs due to heightened geopolitical tensions, says Praveen Singh, Senior Fundamental Research Analyst- Currencies and Commodities at Mirae Asset Sharekhan.

Here’s his outlook on gold prices:

Gold Performance:

In the week ending January 16, the spot gold surged nearly 2% to close at $4595. The rally in the week came on the heels of a sharp 4.6% rise in the week ending January 9.

Driven by safe haven demand as the US President on January 17 threatened 8 EU nations with 10% tariffs beginning February 1 in retaliation to their opposition to his Greenland plans, the yellow metal extended its rally to a fresh record high of $4690 on January 19.

At the time of writing this article, the shiny metal was changing hands at $4672 (MCX February contract Rs 145,500), up 1.67% for the day.

ETF and COMEX gold inventory:

As of January 16, total known global gold ETF holdings stood at 99.86 MOz, highest since August 2022, and are up nearly 1% YTD, as holdings rose for the second straight week.

Registered COMEX gold inventory at 18.86 MOz, is up around 1 MOz from the cycle low of 17.86 MOz but is down over 22% from the record peak of 24.25 MOz seen on April 7.

The US Dollar Index fell around 0.15% to 99.08 on January 19 after rising for three straight weeks.Two-year and ten-year treasury yields jumped nearly 2% last week as the US President expressed doubt over the appointment of Kevin Hassett, a key proponent of lower rate policy. Trump wants to keep him at the White House.The US Bond market was closed on January 19 to observe Martin Luther King Jr Holiday.Trump rattled NATO allies over the weekend after threatening to impose 10% tariffs on 8 EU nations starting February 1 if he doesn’t get control of Greenland.Tariffs will be increased to 25% from June 1. The proposed tariff will be due and payable until a deal is reached for complete and total purchase of Greenland.US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that Europe was too weak to ensure Greenland’s security in an interview on Sunday.International Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said it’s too early to gauge the economic impact of tensions over Greenland, though it could be a headwind for growth.EU ambassadors met on Sunday to discuss options if Trump follows through with his threats. They are considering €93 billion ($108 billion) worth of American goods. The bloc’s leaders are due to meet for an emergency summit on Thursday.The European Union is once again weighing whether to use its most powerful economic weapon — the anti-coercion instrument (ACI) — in a dispute with a major trading partner. The instrument allows the EU to deploy an array of measures in response to coercive trade tactics. It may include new fees on EU imports of US goods and services, curbs on US investments in Europe or a ban on American firms bidding for public contracts.The pending US Supreme Court ruling on some of Trump’s earlier tariffs may come as soon as Tuesday.President Trump will address the annual World Economic Forum in Davos this week and may offer details of home ownership plans for helping Americans buy homes by making it possible to take money out of their 401(K)s and use that for downpayment.Bloomberg reported that respondents in a World Economic Forum survey identify 'geoeconomic confrontation' and 'state-based armed conflict' as the two biggest risks to the global backdrop in 2026.As per Axios, the US officials plan to focus on economic growth, home ownership and peace through strength at WEF, Davos.China’s data released on January 19 showed that China’s economy grew 4.5% on an annualized basis in Q4 2025 vs 4.4% expected. China’s retail sales hit a 3-year low in December, trailing the forecast. Similarly, China’s industrial production, fixed asset investment (December) trailed their respective forecasts.Last week’s data showed that US CPI (December), despite expectations of coming out to be hot on downward adjustments in the November CPI data, was tame. CPI y-o-y was up 2.7% (forecast 2.7%, prior 2.7%). The core CPI also rose 2.7% y-o-y (forecast 2.7%, prior 2.7%). Retail sales advance was up 0.6% m-o-m Vs the estimate of 0.5% and prior reading of -0.1%), while retail sales control group up 0.4% (forecast 0.4%, prior 0.6%).PPI final demand data were hotter than expected though.Industrial production data, released on Friday, was up 0.4% m-o-m (forecast 0.1%) in December.Major US data on the deck this week include 3Q GDP final reading (January 22), real personal spending (January 22), PCE Price Index (January 22) and S&P Global US PMIs, University of Michigan consumer sentiment and inflation expectations (January 23).Major Eurozone data to be released this week include CPI (January 19), services and composite PMIs (January 23). The UK’s CPI (January 21), services and composite PMIs (January 23) will also be monitored by investors.Fresh escalation in geopolitical tensions over Greenland as Trump threatens the EU nations with tariffs to achieve his goal is an unexpected development which is supporting gold prices. Heightened worries and repercussions may also affect global trade and economy. Otherwise, gold could have come under pressure due to diminishing possibility of Hassett becoming the next Fed Chair, a firmer US Dollar and thawing geopolitical tensions as Iran strike had been averted.Still, US Supreme Court ruling over Trump’s tariffs may create huge short-term volatility as his tariffs may be lacking legal basis, though the Trump Administration could resort to other clauses to keep most of the tariffs in place.Trump extending the EU tariff deadline will also weigh on the yellow metal.Spot gold may test resistance around $4750 (MCX February contract Rs 148,000) amid elevated US-EU tariff tensions.However, considering the risks involved, buyers are urged to exercise caution and to put suitable stoploss. Support is at $4608 (Rs 143,500)/$4560 (Rs 142,000). Interim resistance is at $4707 (Rs 146,500).Spot silver surged over 12% in the week ending January 16 as it closed at $89.94 on January 16.Shanghai Gold Exchange Silver price (T+D) at 23271 CNY/Kg is equivalent to around $104/Oz.US imposing tariffs on EU means that the expected flow of silver inventories from COMEX warehouses to LBMA warehouses will be disrupted, which will tighten the spot market.Spot silver, currently at $94.42 (MCX March contract Rs 309,660), up nearly 5% for the day, is expected to trade with a positive bias that will strengthen should the metal closes above $94 mark for two straight days. It may rise to test the resistance zone of $98-$100 (MCX March contract Rs 321,000-Rs 328,000). However, as mentioned earlier in the gold section, utmost caution is needed with a suitable stoploss in place. Support is at $90 (Rs 295,000)/$86 (Rs 282,000).","Gold prices touching new record highs due to heightened geopolitical tensions, says Praveen Singh, Senior Fundamental Research Analyst- Currencies and Commodities at Mirae Asset Sharekhan.

US inflation data: Fed’s preferred gauge stays above target; January rate cut pause in focus,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-inflation-data-feds-preferred-gauge-stays-above-target-january-rate-cut-pause-in-focus/articleshow/127182448.cms,"Borrowing To Look Powerful? Pakistan Pays $1bn For Trump's Gaza Peace Seat While Seeking UAE Rescue

The US Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation measure remained elevated in November, reinforcing expectations that policymakers are likely to pause further interest rate cuts as they assess the impact of earlier easing and new trade-related pressures.Data released by the US Department of Commerce on Thursday showed that the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index rose 2.8% year-on-year in November, marginally higher than 2.7% in October and still above the Fed’s long-term 2% inflation target, AFP reported. On a monthly basis, inflation rose 0.2% in both October and November.Consumer spending continued to show resilience, increasing 0.5% month-on-month in both October and November, though economists cautioned that the momentum may be built on weakening fundamentals.The data, which was delayed due to the prolonged US government shutdown in late 2025, is not the most current snapshot of the economy. Nevertheless, it is expected to factor into the Federal Reserve’s policy deliberations when it meets next week.After three consecutive interest rate cuts in 2025, which brought the benchmark policy rate to a range of 3.50% to 3.75%, the central bank is widely expected to hold rates steady in January.Policymakers are seen preferring to evaluate the cumulative impact of earlier rate reductions, especially as President Donald Trump’s tariff measures begin filtering through supply chains.The Fed continues to balance inflation risks against labour market conditions while adjusting borrowing costs. The persistence of inflation above target underscores the complexity of that task.Excluding volatile food and energy prices, core PCE inflation rose 2.8% year-on-year in November, up from 2.7% in October, signalling limited progress toward disinflation.Analysts at Pantheon Macroeconomics said inflation is still likely to undershoot the Fed’s own projections over time. This, they noted, is due to “the relatively low level of tariff revenues, negligible momentum in new rents, and signs that wage growth is set to slow further.”However, they warned that despite “surprisingly resilient” consumer spending, the expansion appears fragile. “This strength looks built on increasingly shaky foundations,” economists Samuel Tombs and Oliver Allen said in a note, pointing to pressures on real after-tax incomes.The report also showed that the personal saving rate slipped to 3.5% in November, down from 3.7% in October, a level Pantheon described as “unsustainably low.”","US Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation measure remained elevated in November.

India-US Trade Talks Ongoing In Complex Environment, Says Mukesh Aghi

Strong consumer spending lifted the US economy to its fastest growth rate in two years in the July–September quarter, even as job creation remained subdued and concerns over the cost of living persisted.America’s gross domestic product expanded at an annual rate of 4.4% in the third quarter, a slight upward revision from the earlier estimate of 4.3% and faster than the 3.8% growth recorded in the April–June period, according to data released by the Commerce Department on Thursday, AP reported.The latest reading marks the strongest quarterly performance since the third quarter of 2023, driven largely by robust household consumption. Consumer spending, which accounts for about 70% of US economic output, grew at a healthy annual pace of 3.5%, the data showed.A sharp rise in exports alongside a decline in imports also contributed to the strong overall growth in the quarter, according to the government figures.The economy has shown resilience despite uncertainty linked to President Donald Trump’s policies, particularly the imposition of double-digit tariffs on imports from most countries.Still, the strong headline growth has not translated into widespread public confidence. Many Americans remain unhappy with economic conditions, especially the high cost of living, even as spending stays firm.Economists point to a possible “K-shaped economy”, where higher-income households benefit from stock market gains and rising investments, while lower-income groups struggle with stagnant wages and elevated prices.The labour market, meanwhile, appears significantly weaker than overall economic growth suggests. Employers have added an average of just 28,000 jobs a month since March, far below the roughly 400,000 jobs created monthly during the 2021–23 post-pandemic hiring boom.Despite the slowdown in hiring, the unemployment rate remains low at 4.4%, indicating what economists describe as a “no-hire, no-fire” environment, with companies cautious about both expanding payrolls and laying off workers.",America’s gross domestic product expanded at an annual rate of 4.4% in the third quarter.

Asian stocks climbed Thursday following a relief rally in the United States after President Donald Trump stepped back from his threat to impose tariffs on several European countries over their opposition to a US takeover of Greenland. Safe-haven metals, including gold and silver, extended their losses.Asian markets were broadly higher, with Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 rising 1.9 percent to 53,760.85, while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng and Shanghai’s Composite each gained 0.2 percent, closing at 26,630.21 and 4,123.69 respectively, reported AFP.The market swings came after Trump had warned that Germany, France, Britain, and Denmark could face levies for opposing his Greenland plan. The threat had raised fears of a trade war, with French President Emmanuel Macron hinting at the possible use of a previously unused economic deterrent.Traders breathed easier Wednesday when Trump told the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos that he would not take the Danish territory by force and later confirmed he had retracted the planned tariffs.""We have formed the framework of a future deal with respect to Greenland and, in fact, the entire Arctic Region,"" Trump wrote on Truth Social, without giving further details.""Based upon this understanding, I will not be imposing the Tariffs that were scheduled to go into effect on February 1st.""The announcement fueled a US stock rally of more than one percent, which had fallen on Tuesday after the long weekend.

Financial author Robert Kiyosaki on Thursday took to X to highlight silver’s rising importance in the global economy, describing it as “superior” to gold in the Technology Age.In his post, Kiyosaki wrote, “Gold and silver have been money for thousands of years. But…in today’s Technology Age….silver is elevated into an economic structural metal…much like iron was the structural metal of the Industrial Age. ”Kiyosaki noted the dramatic rise in silver prices over the past decades, pointing out that in 1990 it was around $5 an ounce, while in 2026 it has reached $92 an ounce.“Silver is growing more vital as the structural metal of the world’s economic future….a store of value….and as money. I am still calling for silver to hit $200 an ounce in 2026,” he added, while acknowledging the possibility of being wrong.The surge in silver prices comes amid a record-breaking rally in precious metals globally.Silver recently touched $95 per ounce internationally, while domestic rates in India reached Rs 3.34 lakh per kilogram, continuing a nine-day upward streak.Analysts attributed the rally to strong safe-haven demand, tight global supply, geopolitical uncertainties, and a weaker rupee, which kept domestic prices elevated compared with international benchmarks.Saumil Gandhi, senior analyst at HDFC Securities, said, “Gold and silver hit new record highs, driven by persistent safe-haven demand and inflows into bullion-backed exchange-traded funds,” as quoted by news agency PTI.Renisha Chainani, head of research at Augmont, noted that rising geopolitical risks and macroeconomic uncertainty are further strengthening gold and silver demand, with silver prices likely to extend their upward trend.Kiyosaki’s post positions silver not just as a hedge but as a strategic economic metal, mirroring its growing global significance amid ongoing market volatility and rising demand for industrial and technological applications.","Financial author Robert Kiyosaki on Thursday took to X to highlight silver’s rising importance in the global economy.

US natural gas extends historic run: Prices soar nearly 60% in three sessions,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-natural-gas-extends-historic-run-prices-soar-nearly-60-in-three-sessions-whats-fueling-the-surge/articleshow/127093567.cms,"AI image

US natural gas futures surged to around $3.50, gaining about 8.35 per cent in a single session, extending an already historic rally that has seen prices rise nearly 60 per cent over the past three days.Trading volumes remained heavy, reflecting intense repositioning in the market as traders reacted to tightening supply-demand dynamics.The sharp rise is being driven by colder-than-expected weather forecasts across large parts of the Midwest and Northeast, which are pushing up heating demand.This comes at a time when storage levels are already below seasonal norms, leaving little cushion against sudden demand shocks, reported ET.Production growth has failed to keep pace with the jump in consumption expectations, as producers had remained cautious after prolonged periods of low prices. As a result, even small changes in demand assumptions are now triggering outsized price moves.Liquefied natural gas exports are adding further pressure. US export terminals are operating near capacity, sending large volumes overseas and reducing gas available for domestic storage.This has tightly linked US gas prices to global markets, limiting how quickly prices can ease.The price spike has also triggered fuel-switching in the power sector. As gas prices moved past key thresholds, coal became a cheaper option for many utilities, resulting in the need for a reassessment of fuel mixes.At the same time, electricity prices were already under strain due to rising demand from AI data centres, especially in the PJM region, where capacity prices have risen sharply in recent years.The surge coincides with a severe Arctic cold wave sweeping across the US, with millions of households increasing heating usage.AccuWeather has warned that extreme cold could leave hundreds of thousands without power or heat, further intensifying demand pressures.In contrast, crude oil prices have lagged, weighed down by ample global supply, highlighting a growing divergence across commodity markets, with inflation risks increasingly concentrated in gas and electricity rather than the broader energy complex.","US natural gas futures surged to around $3.50, gaining about 8.35 per cent in a single session.

"Fed independence test: US Supreme Court signals support for Lisa Cook, questions Donald Trump’s bid to remove her",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/fed-independence-test-us-supreme-court-signals-support-for-lisa-cook-questions-donald-trumps-bid-to-remove-her/articleshow/127027975.cms,"The US Supreme Court on Wednesday appeared inclined to allow Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook to continue in office, signalling scepticism over President Donald Trump ’s attempt to fire her — a move that could have far-reaching implications for the independence of the central bank, AP reported.During nearly two hours of arguments, a majority of the nine-judge bench questioned the basis and timing of Trump’s effort to remove Cook, the first Black woman to serve as a Fed governor, over allegations of mortgage fraud that she has strongly denied. No US president has fired a sitting Fed governor in the institution’s 112-year history.Allowing Cook’s removal to proceed “would weaken, if not shatter, the independence of the Federal Reserve,” Justice Brett Kavanaugh said, echoing concerns raised by several other justices. At least five members of the court appeared doubtful that Trump’s action should be allowed to take effect while Cook’s legal challenge is still pending.Both Cook and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell were present in the packed courtroom as the justices considered whether Cook should remain in her post while lower courts continue to review the case. Judges in those courts have so far allowed her to stay on the Fed’s seven-member board.The case is being closely watched by Wall Street and policy circles, as Trump’s critics argue that the underlying motivation is his desire to exert greater control over US interest-rate policy. If Cook were removed, Trump could appoint a replacement and potentially secure a majority on the Fed board.Trump has repeatedly criticised the Fed for not cutting rates aggressively enough, arguing that sharply lower rates would reduce government borrowing costs and ease pressure on households buying homes, cars and other big-ticket items. Speaking earlier on Wednesday at the World Economic Forum in Davos, he again called for the US to have “the lowest interest rates in the world”.The Fed cut rates three times in the last four months of 2025 but has signalled caution going forward because of inflation concerns.The immediate issue before the court is procedural: whether Cook can remain in office while the dispute plays out. The justices could deny Trump’s emergency appeal, leaving her in place for now. Chief Justice John Roberts suggested it may be ineffective to simply send the matter back to lower courts without offering clearer guidance.The confrontation has escalated sharply. The Justice Department has opened a criminal investigation into Powell and issued subpoenas to the Fed — actions Powell has publicly described as “pretexts” masking frustration over monetary policy.Trump’s legal team argues that Cook’s alleged mortgage filings — claiming two properties as primary residences in 2021 — amount to “gross negligence at best” and justify her dismissal. Cook, who has not been charged with any crime, denies wrongdoing, saying the case rests on a single, innocuous reference contradicted by other accurate disclosures.While the Supreme Court has previously allowed Trump broad latitude to dismiss heads of other agencies, the justices signalled that the Fed’s unique, quasi-independent status may warrant a different approach.",US Supreme Court appears inclined to allow Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook to continue in office.

The benchmark moved closer to the record high it had touched earlier this month. The Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced about 200 points, or 0.4 per cent, while the Nasdaq Composite edged up 0.1 per cent in early trade, AP reported.Markets found some support after Trump, speaking before business and government leaders in Europe, said he would not use force to take “the piece of ice”, a reference to Greenland. Trump later acknowledged that his comments on Greenland had contributed to Tuesday’s market fall, but dismissed the drop as “peanuts compared to what it’s gone up” during the first year of his second term.In the bond market, US Treasury yields steadied, a day after jumping amid concerns over longer-term inflation. The 10-year Treasury yield eased to 4.28 per cent from 4.30 per cent, though it remained above levels seen before Trump announced plans to impose 10 per cent tariffs on several European countries starting February, in addition to a proposed 15 per cent tariff under a yet-to-be-ratified EU trade agreement.Despite calmer equity trading, some signs of risk aversion persisted.

"EU–Mercosur trade pact: Parliament sends deal to EU court, farmers celebrate while exporters flag risks",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/eumercosur-trade-pact-parliament-sends-deal-to-eu-court-farmers-celebrate-while-exporters-flag-risks/articleshow/127003108.cms,"Explained: Why India-EU 'Mother Of All Deals' Matters As Trade Talks Enter Final High Stakes Phase

The European Parliament has voted to refer the recently signed EU-Mercosur free trade agreement to the bloc’s top court, pushing the long-negotiated pact into legal uncertainty just days after it was sealed, according to an AFP report.Lawmakers in Strasbourg voted 334 to 324 in favour of asking the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) to examine whether the agreement complies with EU rules. The move follows the signing of the deal on Saturday with Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay, aimed at creating one of the world’s largest free trade areas.The decision was greeted with celebration by farming groups, particularly from France, which has led opposition to the pact over concerns about agricultural imports. Hundreds of farmers gathered with tractors outside the European Parliament ahead of the vote and cheered as the result was announced.“We’ve been on this for months and months, for years,” Quentin Le Guillous, head of a French young farmers’ group, told AFP. “Tonight, I’m going home, I’m going to kiss everyone, and I’m going to tell my kids, ‘I got it, we got it, we can be proud.’”The court referral deals a setback to the European Commission, which negotiated and champions the agreement.Commission President Ursula von der Leyen had earlier described the pact as a “historic deal,” especially at a time when countries are seeking new trade partners amid tariff threats from the US administration.The Commission said it “regrets” the parliament’s decision. Trade spokesman Olof Gill said the questions raised by lawmakers were “not justified,” arguing that the Commission had already addressed concerns in detail.At the heart of the legal challenge is whether the agreement can be partially applied before full ratification by all EU member states, and whether it improperly limits EU powers on environmental and food-safety standards.The decision also drew criticism from industry. Hildegard Mueller, head of Germany’s auto industry group VDA, said the vote sent a “devastating sign” and risked alienating Mercosur partners at a time of heightened geopolitical uncertainty.Germany, Spain and Nordic countries back the deal, viewing it as a way to boost exports amid competition from China. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said after the vote: “We are convinced of the legality of the agreement. No more delays. The agreement must now be provisionally applied.”However, France, Poland, Austria, Ireland and Hungary remain opposed, citing risks to domestic agriculture. French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot said, “The fight continues to protect our agriculture and guarantee our food sovereignty.”The EU-Mercosur deal would ease tariffs on more than 90 per cent of bilateral trade, favouring European exports such as cars, wine and cheese, while opening EU markets further to South American beef, poultry, sugar and soy.Together, the EU and Mercosur account for around 30 per cent of global GDP and more than 700 million consumers.","The European Parliament has voted to refer the recently signed EU-Mercosur free trade agreement to the bloc's top court.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Startups will play important role in helping India become 3rd largest economy: CEA Nageswaran,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/startups-will-play-important-role-in-helping-india-become-3rd-largest-economy-cea-nageswaran/articleshow/105332523.cms,"Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran





THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor (CEA) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran Udaan until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.Udaan built an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business still accounts for a very small part of India’s overall retail market but can balloon to $150 billion in sales and yield a 100% return on capital invested in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co. estimates published in the Mint newspaper.Bengaluru-based Udaan has also ventured into financing through its fintech unit which helps shopkeepers get working capital loans to buy inventory. That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says.

How India's GDP has been growing

What SBI report said on savings and investment

Incremental capital output ratio

NEW DELHI: India's gross domestic product (GDP) data for the third quarter (October-December 2022) received a word of caution from the former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan In an interview with news agency PTI, Rajan that India is ""dangerously close"" to the Hindu rate of growth in view of subdued private sector investment, high interest rates and slowing global growth.India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying"".However, a report released by the State Bank of India (SBI) economists on Tuesday dismissed arguments that India is dangerously close to Hindu rate of growth saying such statements are ""ill-conceived, biased and premature"".The term 'Hindu growth rate' was coined by late economist Raj Krishna in 1978 to describe the slow growth in the country.It basically refers to the low pace of economic growth rates during 1950s to 1980s. During this period, the Indian economy averaged 3.5%.A former lecturer at the Delhi School of Economics (DSE), Krishna noted that only if the rate of growth is persistently slow and accompanied by low per-capita GDP, then it will be known as Hindu rate of growth but it has to factor in population growth as well.Before economic reforms of 1991, India's economic growth remained stagnant and low, while per capita income averaged around 1.3%.Krishna termed this low growth situation to be a result of socialist policies of state control and import substitution.However, the economic situation changed when liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation (LPG) reforms came into effect in the year 1991, at a time when India faced balance of payment crisis.Over the years, many economists have strongly opposed the idea of 'Hindu growth rate' and the term never had universal acceptance.The Indian economy plunged into its very first technical recession in FY21 due to the impact of Covid-19 pandemic and the related nationwide lockdowns. GDP shrunk by an unprecedented 23.8% in the first quarter of the financial year 2020-21. However, due to spurt in economic activities in the subsequent quarters, the GDP decline started to narrow.However, if we look at the period before Covid-19 as well, India's growth curve shows a declining trend.From 8.26% in FY17, GDP growth plunged to 3.74% in FY20. Shutdown of economic activities in FY21 in wake of Covid-19 only made matters worse.As lockdowns started to ease and business activities resumed, India's GDP also started rising. In Q1 of FY22, growth jumped to 20.1% mainly on account of low base effect. By the fourth quarter of FY22, growth came down to 4.10%.Similarly, the new financial year 2022-23 brought fresh economic challenges in the form of Russia-Ukraine war that impacted almost all major economies of the world, slowed the pace of growth, pushed inflation to record highs.As a result, the central banks of all advanced economies spurred into action and opted for monetary policy tightening to curb the soaring inflation.With persistently rising interest rates, India's economy grew by 4.4% in Q3 of FY23, as the Centre revised upwards GDP growth for previous year to 9.10% from 8.7% earlier.The report weighed recent GDP numbers against the available data on savings and investments for the past decade and highlighted some interesting points.""Quarterly growth numbers are noisy and should be best avoided for any serious interpretation (on an average, India's GDP growth has witnessed Rs 2 lakh crore upward revision for the 3 year ended FY23),"" the report said.Gross capital formation (GCF) by the government touched a high of 11.8% in 2021-22, up from 10.7% in 2020-21.""This also had a domino effect on private sector investment that jumped from 10 per cent to 10.8% over the same period,"" it said.In fact, Ecowrap added that the trends in GCF to gross output ratio or the plough back of funds for creation of fresh capacity shows that for public administration the ratio attained fresh peak in 2021-22 owing to the emphasis on capital expenditure in recent budgets.At the aggregate level, gross capital formation is supposed to have crossed 32% in 2022-23, the highest level since 2018-19.According to the report, in 2021-22, gross savings have risen to 30% from 29% in 2020-21.""The ratio is supposed to have crossed 31 per cent in 2022-23, the highest since 2018-19. The household savings increased sharply during the pandemic period on account of sharp accretion in financial savings such as deposits,"" said the report by SBI's Economic Research Department.While household financial savings have since then moderated from 15.4% in 2020-21 to 11.1% in 2022-23, savings in physical assets have grown sharply to 11.8% in 2021-22 from 10.7% in 2020-21.The report further analysed Incremental Capital Output ratio (ICOR) -- which measures additional units of capital (investment) needed to produce additional units of output. It said that the ratio has been improving.""ICOR which was 7.5 in FY 12 is now only 3.5 in FY22. Clearly, only half of capital is now needed for next unit of output,"" the report noted.Such reducing ICOR in the current years reflects a relatively increasing efficiency of capital and shows that the economy is on a sound footing, the report said.""From that point of view, future GDP growth rates even at 7% could still mean a decent number by any standards!,"" it added.","India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.

An employee is entitled for a 50 per cent amount of the last drawn salary as pension.OPS was discontinued by the NDA government in 2003 with effect from April 1, 2004.Under the new pension scheme (NPS), employees contribute 10 per cent of their basic salary towards pension while the government contributes 14 per cent.Governments of Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand have informed the central government/ Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA about their decision to restart OPS for their employees.The government of Punjab on November 18, 2022, issued a notification regarding implementation of OPS for the state government employees who are being covered under NPS. Jharkhand too has decided to revert to OPS.",Former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan has expressed his concern over the decision of some states to restart the old pension scheme.

The meeting was chaired by Food Secretary Sanjeev Chopra.Out of the total wheat procurement target for the 2022-23 marketing year (April-March), Punjab will aim to procure 2.5 million tonnes wheat, Haryana 1.5 million tonnes and Madhya Pradrsh 2 million tonnes, the food ministry said in a statement.Wheat procurement had declined last year due to a fall in domestic production and higher exports.However, the government has projected a record wheat production at 112.18 million tonnes in the 2023-24 crop year (July-June) as per the second estimate of the agriculture ministry.Besides wheat, the government has also fixed rabi (winter) rice procurement target at 10.6 million tonnes in the 2022-23 marketing year.States have been advised to enhance rice milling capacity so that milling of one season gets completed before the commencement of next season and recycling of rice may be avoided.Whereas procurement of millets and coarse grains is estimated to be 7,50,000 tonnes this year, higher than 6,30,000 tonnes in 2021-22.

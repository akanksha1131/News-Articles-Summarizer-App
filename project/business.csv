Paytm stock price today: One 97 Communications shares crash 10% on FinMin's statement on UPI transactions,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/paytm-stock-price-today-paytm-shares-crash-10-after-finance-ministry-dismisses-mdr-on-upi-transactions/articleshow/121794025.cms,"NEW DELHI: Paytm on Thursday tumbled as much as 10% on Thursday hitting an intraday low of Rs 864.40 on BSE Sensex, after the finance ministry clarified that there are no plans to introduce a Merchant Discount Rate (MDR) on UPI transactions.As of 10 am, Paytm was trading 6% lower, underperforming the broader NSE Nifty 50, which was down just 0.14%. This marks Paytm's steepest single-day drop since February 2024, as investor sentiment took a hit following the official denial.The sharp fall in the stock price of One 97 Communications, Paytm’s parent company, came after the finance ministry on Wednesday clarified that reports suggesting MDR charges on UPI payments were ""false, baseless, and misleading.""""Speculation and claims that the MDR will be charged on UPI transactions are completely false, baseless, and misleading. Such baseless and sensation-creating speculations cause needless uncertainty, fear and suspicion among our citizens. The Government remains fully committed to promoting digital payments via UPI,"" Finance ministry wrote on X.The clarification came after some media reports suggested the government was considering levying MDR on UPI transactions only for large merchants to support banks and payment providers.Earlier in March, the Payments Council of India (PCI), which represents over 180 digital payment firms, urged the government to reconsider the introduction of merchant discount rate (MDR) on UPI transactions and RuPay debit cards.The industry body has sought an MDR of 0.3% on UPI transactions only for large merchants and a nominal MDR on RuPay debit cards for all merchants.The council warned that without MDR, the digital payments infrastructure could become unsustainable, affecting innovation, cybersecurity, and customer support.PCI argued that the policy, in place since January 2020, has put pressure on the payment ecosystem, despite a Rs 1,500 crore government incentive that falls far short of the estimated Rs 10,000 crore needed annually. Members of PCI include major players like Amazon Pay, PhonePe, Paytm, and Razorpay.",Paytm tumbled as much as 10% on Thursday hitting an intraday low of Rs 864.40 on BSE Sensex. The finance ministry clarified that there are no plans to introduce a Merchant Discount Rate (MDR) on UPI transactions.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121794451,imgsize-35886,width-400,resizemode-4/121794451.jpg"
Tesla robotaxi launch in Austin: Elon Musk sets 'tentative date'; says 'we are being super paranoid about safety',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/tesla-robotaxi-launch-in-austin-elon-musk-sets-tentative-date-says-we-are-being-super-paranoid-about-safety/articleshow/121766446.cms,"Billionaire Elon Musk announced on Tuesday that the electric vehicle manufacturing giant Tesla is ""tentatively"" set to begin its long-awaited robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, on June 22.Sharing a post on social media platform X, Musk said the launch would take place in Austin, calling the timeline ""tentatively, June 22.""""We are being super paranoid about safety, so the date could shift,"" Musk added.The announcement marks a major step in Tesla's autonomous driving plans. If the rollout happens as planned, it would mark a major milestone in Tesla's Full Self-Driving (FSD) program—a technology that has faced years of delays and criticism.Musk also revealed that the first Tesla to fully ""drive itself from the factory end of line all the way to a customer house is June 28.""Earlier, Musk responded to a video on X showing what appears to be one of Tesla's first robotaxis in Austin, a Model Y carrying a passenger with no driver behind the wheel.The car had a ""Robotaxi"" logo on its side.""These are unmodified Tesla cars coming straight from the factory, meaning that every Tesla coming out of our factories is capable of unsupervised self-driving!"" Musk wrote on X.Investors, analysts, and Tesla fans have been closely watching for this moment since Musk said earlier this year that the robotaxi service would launch in Austin sometime in June.In an interview with CNBC last month, Musk outlined initial plans for the service, stating that the vehicles would operate under remote supervision and ""geofenced"".He indicated plans to begin with approximately 10 vehicles, with rapid expansion planned for other metropolitan areas including Los Angeles, San Antonio and San Francisco.Musk has spent years promising fully self-driving Teslas “next year,” but now the pressure is real as the company begins rolling out its robotaxi service. Tesla's electric vehicle sales have recently dipped, hit by rising competition, the revamp of its popular Model Y, and the backlash from Musk’s political statements.The Austin launch coincides with a reported clash between Musk and US President Donald Trump over tax policy. Some analysts worry this could lead to more scrutiny from federal safety regulators if problems arise with the robotaxis.Still, Wall Street remains hopeful.

Gold and silver price prediction: Gold prices have been currently recovering after dipping from recent highs. Silver prices on the other hand are touching new highs. Amidst the ongoing trade and geopolitical tensions, gold and silver are being seen as safe haven investments, though in a muted way. What is the gold and silver price outlook and what should be the target levels for investors?Gold is currently trading above a falling channel on the weekly chart, indicating a bullish trend characterized by higher highs and higher lows. This pattern suggests that prices are in a recovery phase, potentially setting the stage for further gains.A key support level is observed around ₹96,600. If prices break below this level, it could introduce selling pressure, potentially driving prices down to ₹95,000. Such a decline would test the strength of the support and could lead to a short-term bearish phase.Conversely, if gold maintains its position above ₹96,100, it may continue its upward trajectory. A bounce from this support could propel prices towards next significant resistance at ₹99,000.This level is crucial; a breakout above ₹99,000 could signal a continuation of the bullish trend, opening the path for higher targets.In summary, gold's current position above the falling channel suggests a bullish outlook. Maintaining support above ₹96,600 is vital for sustaining upward momentum. Traders should monitor these levels closely, as breaks below support or above resistance will provide clearer directional cues.Silver has recently broken through a significant resistance level around ₹1,01,000, indicating a potential shift in market sentiment. Currently trading above ₹1,05,000, the metal is poised to test the next resistance at ₹1,10,000.A key support level is observed at ₹1,04,000. Should prices dip to this level, it would provide an opportunity for a rebound, with the potential to reach ₹1,07,000. A sustained move above ₹1,04,000 could open the path for further gains, possibly targeting ₹1,10,000.The bullish momentum is supported by several factors. China's economic policies, including interest rate cuts to stimulate growth, have increased demand for silver, a crucial component in various industrial applications . Additionally, geopolitical tensions and expectations of a dovish stance from the U.S. Federal Reserve have driven investors towards safe-haven assets like silver .In summary, silver's breakout above ₹1,01,000, coupled with strong support at ₹1,04,000, suggests a bullish outlook. Traders should monitor these levels closely, as a move above ₹1,07,000 could signal further upside potential.","Gold prices have been recovering after dipping from recent highs.

'Trump Card is coming': $5m gold card offering US residency now accepting applications; key details,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/trump-card-is-coming-5m-gold-card-offering-us-residency-now-accepting-applications-key-details/articleshow/121790287.cms,"(Source: Donald Trump's Truth Social account)

The

Trump Card

is coming!

What the card promises — and what it doesn’t

A replacement for EB-5?

Major tax advantage for card holders

The much-hyped “Trump Card” is now officially open for registration, offering wealthy foreigners a chance to join a waiting list.US President Donald Trump describes it as a premium route toward US citizenship, for a hefty $5 million price tag.The official website, TrumpCard.gov, features an image of the shiny gold-coloured card, complete with Trump’s photo, signature and name. The form asks for basic details like name, email, region of origin, and whether the applicant is applying as an individual or a business.Trump announced the launch on his social media platform Truth Social, “For five million $DOLLARS, The Trump Card is coming! Thousands have been calling and asking how they can sign up to ride a beautiful road in gaining access to the greatest country and market anywhere in the world.”“The waiting list is now open,” he added.The website lists eight regions for applicants to choose from: Europe, Asia (including the Middle East), North America, Oceania, Central America, South America, the Caribbean and Africa.Above the details, the site ensures that applicants will be notified when access opens: ‘Enter your information below to be notified the moment access opens.’Trump claims the card offers a “path to citizenship,” but he has clarified that it does not guarantee immediate entry or naturalisation. “It’s somewhat like a green card , but at a higher level of sophistication,” the POTUS has claimed.The Trump administration insists the new card does not require approval from Congress, as it doesn’t provide citizenship outright. White House officials have said more information will be released soon, reports USA Today.Under the existing US naturalisation system, immigrants must typically be lawful permanent residents for at least five years, meet age and language criteria, and have a clean record.Trump first proposed the Trump Card earlier this year as a replacement for the EB-5 investor visa programme, which grants green cards to foreigners who invest between $800,000 and $1.05 million into US job-creating projects. The EB-5 programme has long suffered from backlogs and accusations of fraud.“Wealthy people will be coming into our country by buying this card,” Trump said in February. “They'll be wealthy, and they'll be successful, and they'll be spending a lot of money, and paying a lot of taxes and employing a lot of people.”He added, “It’s a road to citizenship for people and essentially people of wealth or people of great talent where people of wealth pay for those people of talent to get in.”One of the key selling points of the Trump Card appears to be its potential tax benefits. Trump has suggested that gold card buyers would only be taxed on their US earnings, unlike green card holders, who are taxed on worldwide income. This is likely to appeal to many high-net-worth individuals who have avoided relocating to the US due to its global tax obligations.Trump Card does not seem to require applicants to create US-based jobs or launch businesses, unlike the EB-5 visa programme. US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick has claimed that 1,000 cards were sold in a single day, even though the programme has yet to officially launch. According to Lutnick, some 37 million people worldwide could afford the Trump Card.Trump has claimed he was the first to purchase the Trump Card himself. “I had no idea who would be the second,” he said. However, the programme is not designed for American citizens.","The much-hyped ‘Trump Card’ is now officially open for registration.

Oil retreated from its surge over West Asia tensions as traders weigh the latest developments in the region against a risk-off mood triggered by renewed tariff threats from Washington. At the same time, the dollar fell to the weakest level in three years amid worries over the outlook for the US economy.The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index slid as much as 0.8% on Thursday to the lowest level since April 2022. The euro jumped to the strongest since 2021, while the British pound advanced to a new three-year high. So far in 2025, the dollar is down more than 8% as investors build up bets that US President Donald Trump's trade and tax policies will weigh on the economy.The concern remains that the US could experience a spike in inflation and start sliding toward a recession amid Trump's sweeping tariffs on imports. This has investors poring over incoming economic data, especially on the labour market, to determine the path of rates in the US.Brent slipped near $69 a barrel after jumping 4.3% on Wednesday, the most since Oct, with signs the rally was overstretched. Crude shot up after Iran threatened to strike US bases if nuclear talks fell through and the US told some staff to depart the embassy in Iraq.The UK Navy issued a warning to ships sailing across the Strait of Hormuz, through which over a quarter of the world's oil travels.On the trade front, Trump said he intended to send letters to trading partners in the next one to two weeks setting unilateral tariff rates, ahead of a July 9 deadline to reimpose higher duties on dozens of economies. That blunted appetite for risk assets.","Brent slipped near $69 a barrel after jumping 4.3% on Wednesday, the most since Oct.

The Idaho-based firm said the broader investment will allocate $150 billion for manufacturing and $50 billion for R&D over the coming years, generating an estimated 90,000 direct and indirect jobs across several US states, AFP reported.The move aligns with the Trump administration’s push to secure large-scale investments from technology firms and revive US industrial capacity. Trump has repeatedly urged companies to expand domestic manufacturing and has warned of steep tariffs on imports to spur local production.Micron’s announcement also includes modernization of its existing plant in Manassas, Virginia, and the addition of end-to-end High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) manufacturing in the US—critical to national defense and AI applications.The investment drew praise from major US tech leaders.

"US stock markets today: Wall Street drifts as inflation data sparks rate cut hopes, Boeing stock tumbles after Air India plane crash",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-stock-market-today-june-12-dow-jones-nasdaq-sp-500-wall-street-boeing-share-boeing-air-india-boeing-787-dreamliner-crash/articleshow/121806178.cms,"Air India Crash FIRST DATA Out: Boeing 787’s Flight Tracking Record Reveals Terrifying Details

US stock indexes were mostly flat on Thursday afternoon as investors processed another encouraging report on inflation. The S&P 500 edged 0.2% higher, bringing it within 2% of its all-time high. The Nasdaq composite also rose 0.2%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped by 13 points, or less than 0.1%, as of 12:23 p.m. Eastern time.Oracle provided a boost to the markets, surging 14.4% after the tech company reported stronger-than-expected quarterly profits and revenue. CEO Safra Catz projected that revenue growth “will be dramatically higher” in the upcoming fiscal year.That optimism helped offset a sharp 4.9% decline in Boeing shares. The drop followed news that an Air India Boeing 787 Dreamliner, en route to London, crashed shortly after takeoff from Ahmedabad airport with 242 people on board. The aircraft went down in a residential area five minutes after departure. The cause of the crash has not yet been determined.Markets also drew support from easing Treasury yields, following the latest inflation data. Thursday’s report showed that wholesale-level inflation in May was lower than economists had anticipated.That followed Wednesday’s release indicating consumer inflation was also milder than expected.Investors viewed the data as a potential signal that the Federal Reserve could have more flexibility to reduce interest rates later in the year to support the economy. The Fed has so far held off on additional cuts in 2025, citing uncertainty over how President Donald Trump’s tariffs might affect both inflation and economic growth.Although lower interest rates tend to stimulate economic activity by making borrowing cheaper, they can also risk pushing inflation higher. The 10-year Treasury yield declined to 4.36% on Thursday, down from 4.41% late Wednesday and from around 4.80% earlier this year.Another report, showing jobless claims ticked up slightly last week and remained at their highest level in eight months, also contributed to the decline in yields. Economists had expected a lower number of claims.“We believe that were it not for the uncertainty caused by the tariffs, the combined information coming from the inflation and labor-market data would have compelled the Fed to have resumed cutting its policy rate by now,” said Thierry Wizman, strategist at Macquarie, as quoted PTI.The Federal Reserve is scheduled to hold its next policy meeting next week, and markets widely expect it will leave interest rates unchanged. However, traders are betting the first rate cut could come in September, according to CME Group data.Trump’s tariff policies have weighed heavily on market sentiment over the past several months. At one point, concerns over inflation and a potential recession pushed the S&P 500 down by nearly 20% from its peak. Since then, equities have rebounded significantly amid hopes that Trump might ease tariffs through new trade agreements.Still, uncertainty persists. Late Wednesday, Trump reignited concerns by suggesting the US could issue ultimatums to foreign governments: “saying this is the deal. You can take it or you can leave it.”Globally, stock market performances were mixed on Thursday. Most European and Asian indexes saw modest changes. However, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index dropped 1.4%, reversing part of its recent rally. Despite the decline, the index remains up nearly 20% for the year—well ahead of the S&P 500’s year-to-date gain of under 3%.","The S&P 500 edged 0.2% higher, bringing it within 2% of its all-time high.

"US producer prices holds at 2.6% in May; wholesale prices rose 0.1% from April, Fed seen staying cautious on rate cuts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-producer-prices-holds-at-2-6-in-may-wholesale-prices-rose-0-1-from-april-fed-seen-staying-cautious-on-rate-cuts/articleshow/121805636.cms,"US producer prices rose modestly in May, offering further evidence that inflationary pressures remain subdued even as tariffs continue to loom over global trade, according to data released by the Labor Department on Thursday.The Producer Price Index (PPI), which tracks inflation at the wholesale level before it reaches consumers, rose 2.6% in May from a year earlier. On a monthly basis, prices increased just 0.1% after a 0.2% decline in April. Both readings came in slightly below economists' expectations, AP reported.Excluding the often-volatile categories of food and energy, so-called core wholesale prices rose 0.1% from April and 3% from a year earlier.Energy prices were flat overall, although gasoline rose 1.6% following a decline the previous month. Food prices at the wholesale level edged up 0.1%, while egg prices — which had dropped a sharp 39.3% in April — rebounded by 1.4% in May. Egg prices remain 125% higher compared to May 2024, largely due to supply disruptions from the bird flu outbreak.The PPI data came a day after the Consumer Price Index showed a similar trend, with consumer inflation rising just 0.1% month-on-month and 2.4% year-on-year in May.Despite US President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariff policy — which includes a 10% baseline levy on nearly all imports and targeted duties on steel, aluminum, and autos — inflation has yet to show a broad-based resurgence. Economists caution, however, that the full effects of the tariffs may emerge later in the year as supply chains adjust and importers pass on higher costs.The PPI is closely watched because some of its components, such as health care and financial services, are factored into the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge, the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index.Inflation surged in 2021 as the economy rebounded sharply from pandemic-era lockdowns, prompting the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates 11 times in 2022 and 2023. Those aggressive hikes helped tame inflation from its 2022 peak, allowing the Fed to cut rates three times last year.However, the Fed has adopted a more cautious stance in 2025 amid uncertainty over the inflationary effects of recent trade measures. The central bank is widely expected to keep its benchmark rate unchanged at next week’s policy meeting.","Producer Price Index (PPI), which tracks inflation at the wholesale level before it reaches consumers, rose 2.6% in May from a year earlier.

The blow to GDP came mainly from the services sector, which shrank by 0.4%, led by a slump in real estate and legal activity following the end of a temporary property transaction tax break. That alone accounted for two-thirds of the GDP decline.Exports to the US fell by £2 billion in April — the largest monthly drop on record — as Trump’s tariffs on global imports, including a 10% levy on goods and higher rates on aluminium and steel, began to bite. Britain remains the only major economy with a bilateral trade deal aimed at shielding it from some of these duties, but core tariffs remain in place, Reuters reported.""The GDP numbers are clearly disappointing,"" UK Finance Minister Rachel Reeves said, just a day after announcing a multi-year public spending review worth over £2 trillion.Economists cited not just the tariff shock but also domestic fiscal tightening and the delayed effects of past interest rate hikes as factors behind the slowdown.“Looking through the noise and data quality issues, we expect the underlying pace of growth to remain underwhelming,” said Matt Swannell of the EY ITEM Club.Despite a strong Q1 performance — with 0.7% growth, the highest among G7 economies — the Bank of England last month lowered its 2026 growth forecast to 1.25%, projecting that the US tariff regime would reduce UK output by 0.3% over the next three years.The weak April data complicates the BoE’s monetary policy outlook. While a rate cut is unlikely at next week’s meeting due to persistent inflation concerns, many economists now expect the central bank to ease policy in August.“The door is probably closed on a cut next week, but these downbeat figures increase the likelihood of a policy loosening later this summer,” said Suren Thiru, economics director at ICAEW.Sterling fell nearly half a cent against the dollar after the data release, and government bond yields slipped to a one-month low.Among major sectors, construction was the only bright spot, growing 0.9% in April. Industrial production fell 0.6%, with manufacturing down 0.9%.The Office for National Statistics (ONS) also reported that the UK’s goods trade deficit widened to £23.2 billion in April from £19.9 billion in March, exceeding expectations.Analysts remain cautious about the path forward. “The drag from US trade policy has added to a range of domestic headwinds,” said Swannell, warning that the seasonal volatility seen since the pandemic may continue to skew month-to-month GDP readings.","Britain's economy contracted 0.3% in April, the steepest monthly decline since October 2023.

US President Donald Trump on Wednesday said he's open to extending the July 8 deadline for trade talks before higher tariffs kick in, but added that an extension probably won't be ""a necessity. ""Speaking to reporters ahead of a performance at the Kennedy Center Trump said, ""We're rocking in terms of deals. We're dealing with quite a few countries and they all want to make a deal with us.""Despite being open to some flexibility, Trump stressed that he didn't see an extension would be ""a necessity.""""We're dealing with Japan. We're dealing with South Korea. We're dealing with a lot of them. We're dealing with about 15 countries,"" the US President told the reporters.Trump further continued that the United States will soon send letters outlining final trade deal terms to dozens of countries. ""But as you know, we have about 150-plus, and you can't [make a deal with all of them]. So we're going to be sending letters out in about a week and a half, two weeks, to countries and telling them what the deal is,"" he said.""At a certain point, we're just going to send letters out ... saying, 'This is the deal.You can take it, or you can leave it,'"" Trump said. ""So at a certain point we'll do that. We're not quite ready,"" he added.Currently, only one deal, with the United Kingdom has been finalised, while about 17 others are still under negotiation. A 90-day pause on Trump's sweeping ""reciprocal"" tariffs is set to expire on July 8, putting pressure on countries to reach agreements.US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, speaking to lawmakers, said the deadline could be extended for some nations. Bessent explained to the House Ways and Means Committee that, ""It is highly likely that those countries - or trading blocs as is the case with the EU - who are negotiating in good faith, we will roll the date forward to continue the good-faith negotiations.""""If someone is not negotiating, then we will not."" Bessent added.Bessent’s comments marked the first time a Trump administration official suggested there could be flexibility on the tariff pause deadline.Trump echoed this sentiment, saying, ""They do want to negotiate.""Earlier on Tuesday (local time), Trump has confirmed that a new trade deal with China is ""done,"" pending final approval from both him and Chinese President Xi Jinping. Under the agreement, the US will impose a 55% tariff on Chinese imports, while China will apply a 10% tariff on American goods.""We made a great deal with China. We're very happy with it,"" Trump told reporters at the Kennedy Center, further adding that, ""We have everything we need, and we're going to do very well with it. And hopefully they are, too.""Trump revealed that China will supply the US with magnets and rare earth materials as part of the deal. In return, Chinese students will be allowed to continue studying at American universities—a reversal from Trump’s earlier restrictions on their presence at US institutions.Trump posted on Truth Social, ""Our deal with China is done, subject to final approval with president xi and me. full magnets, and any necessary rare earths, will be supplied, up front, by China. Likewise, we will provide to China what was agreed to, including Chinese students using our colleges and universities (which has always been good with me!). We are getting a total of 55% tariffs, China is getting 10%. Relationship is excellent!""""Adding to the China readout, President XI and I are going to work closely together to open up China to American Trade. This would be a great WIN for both countries!!!,"" Trump said in separate post.The backdrop to these developments is Trump’s abrupt announcement on April 9 of a pause in his aggressive tariff plans, which had shocked global markets a week earlier when he unveiled sweeping ""Liberation Day"" tariffs on nearly all major trading partners.The move sent the S&P 500 Index tumbling over 12% in just four days, its worst drop since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic. Even US Treasury bonds were hit, with yields spiking and the dollar sinking.Markets only began to stabilise on April 9, when Trump unexpectedly paused the tariff rollout. Optimism returned in May as the administration scaled back aggressive tariff plans, especially against China.","US President Donald Trump said he's open to extending the July 8 deadline for trade talks before higher tariffs kick in.

'Great numbers': Trump pushes US Fed for 'one full point' rate cut after CPI data; markets weigh US-China trade deal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/great-numbers-trump-pushes-us-fed-for-one-full-point-rate-cut-after-cpi-data-markets-eye-policy-shift-amid-easing-price-pressures/articleshow/121781837.cms,"US President Donald Trump renewed his call for a full percentage point interest rate cut on Wednesday, citing “great” inflation numbers just released by the Labor Department.“CPI JUST OUT. GREAT NUMBERS! FED SHOULD LOWER ONE FULL POINT. WOULD PAY MUCH LESS INTEREST ON DEBT COMING DUE. SO IMPORTANT!!!” Trump posted on Truth Social, amplifying pressure on the Federal Reserve to act decisively.The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 2.4% in May from a year earlier, slightly higher than April’s 2.3% but still within a relatively tame range. Core inflation—which excludes food and energy—remained steady at 2.8% for the third straight month. On a month-over-month basis, both headline and core inflation ticked up just 0.1%.The mild headline figures mask complex undercurrents. Grocery prices rose 0.3% from April to May, and are up 2.2% on the year. Price increases were also seen in toys, games, and large appliances—areas potentially exposed to tariffs. Yet declines in the cost of new and used cars, airfares, and hotel stays helped offset the broader impact, at least temporarily.Economists say these soft readings may not last.“You can point to seeing tariffs in this report, but the more important message is that you're seeing inflation soften enough elsewhere that overall, price pressures continue to subside for the US consumer,” said Sarah House, senior economist at Wells Fargo, as quoted by AP. “I don’t think this report signals an all clear—that tariffs are not going to be a concern for the inflation picture.”Trump’s new tariff regime—55% on all Chinese imports, 10% on goods from all other countries, and 50% on steel and aluminum—has so far had a delayed effect on prices. Analysts attribute this to companies front-loading inventories before duties kicked in and holding off on price hikes amid fluctuating trade announcements.However, that buffer may be ending. Bryan Eshelman, managing director at AlixPartners, expects retail prices—especially for back-to-school items like backpacks and clothes—to jump between 5% and 15% by July.The J.M. Smucker Company has already raised coffee prices in May and plans another hike in August, citing rising costs from 10% tariffs on imports from Brazil and Vietnam. CEO Mark Smucker said green coffee imports—500 million pounds annually—are currently their largest tariff exposure.The Federal Reserve, facing inflation that still runs above its 2% target, is likely to remain cautious. Chair Jerome Powell and others have said they will wait for clearer signs of how tariffs are affecting the economy before moving on rates.","The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 2.4% in May from a year earlier, slightly higher than April’s 2.3% but still within a relatively tame range.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021.

Space sector start-up Sisir Radar to develop SAR on L/P band SAR,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/space-sector-start-up-sisir-radar-to-develop-sar-on-l/p-band-sar/articleshow/104558111.cms,"CHENNAI: Space sector startup, Sisir Radar Private Ltd has hit success at the prestigious iDEX DefSpace Challenge with its projects for development of “L/P band Continuous Wave SAR (synthetic aperture radar) payload for LEO Small Satellites” and “Unfurlable, Electronically Steering Antenna for L/P band SAR payload” for Indian Air Force (IAF), said a top company official.The company is promoted by former Director at the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) Tapan Misra and the brains behind the Indian space agency’s RISAT series of SAR satellites as well as the Dual Frequency SAR on the Chandrayaan 2 orbiter that is currently circling the moon.""A grant of Rs 3 crore is also there for development of the products,"" Misra told IANS.Synthetic Aperture Radar or SAR is a special kind of imaging radar technology that can provide extremely accurate high resolution imagery of the terrain through clouds, smoke and dust even in pitch dark conditions. SAR imagery provides much higher resolution than other forms of remote sensing technology such as hyperspectral and multispectral. SAR is a critical technology for strategic reconnaissance and planning as well as for disaster management.According to Misra, winning the challenge in just over a year of floating the company is a major booster.He said L and P band SAR have an advantage over other frequencies (like X band) when it comes to penetration capabilities through rain, clouds, foliage and vegetation in a tropical country like India, and underground penetration capabilities in dry terrain.Continuing further, he said the L band SAR will provide 1 metre resolution, spotlight resolution in Stripmap mode. The current industry standard is 5-10 metre in L band. Misra said both the L and P band will operate simultaneously from a satellite borne SAR. Recently, Sisir Radar successfully developed and tested the world’s highest resolution L-Band SAR fitted on a drone. With 0.2 metre resolution, this is by far the highest L band SAR in the world, he said.","Space sector startup, Sisir Radar Private Ltd has hit success at the prestigious iDEX DefSpace Challenge.

Explainer: What is 'Hindu rate of growth' and why Raghuram Rajan's remarks may be 'premature',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/explainer-what-is-hindu-rate-of-growth-and-why-raghuram-rajans-remarks-may-be-premature/articleshow/98482598.cms,"What is meant by Hindu growth rate

How India's GDP has been growing

What SBI report said on savings and investment

Incremental capital output ratio

NEW DELHI: India's gross domestic product (GDP) data for the third quarter (October-December 2022) received a word of caution from the former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan In an interview with news agency PTI, Rajan that India is ""dangerously close"" to the Hindu rate of growth in view of subdued private sector investment, high interest rates and slowing global growth.India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying"".However, a report released by the State Bank of India (SBI) economists on Tuesday dismissed arguments that India is dangerously close to Hindu rate of growth saying such statements are ""ill-conceived, biased and premature"".The term 'Hindu growth rate' was coined by late economist Raj Krishna in 1978 to describe the slow growth in the country.It basically refers to the low pace of economic growth rates during 1950s to 1980s. During this period, the Indian economy averaged 3.5%.A former lecturer at the Delhi School of Economics (DSE), Krishna noted that only if the rate of growth is persistently slow and accompanied by low per-capita GDP, then it will be known as Hindu rate of growth but it has to factor in population growth as well.Before economic reforms of 1991, India's economic growth remained stagnant and low, while per capita income averaged around 1.3%. Krishna termed this low growth situation to be a result of socialist policies of state control and import substitution.However, the economic situation changed when liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation (LPG) reforms came into effect in the year 1991, at a time when India faced balance of payment crisis.Over the years, many economists have strongly opposed the idea of 'Hindu growth rate' and the term never had universal acceptance.The Indian economy plunged into its very first technical recession in FY21 due to the impact of Covid-19 pandemic and the related nationwide lockdowns. GDP shrunk by an unprecedented 23.8% in the first quarter of the financial year 2020-21. However, due to spurt in economic activities in the subsequent quarters, the GDP decline started to narrow.However, if we look at the period before Covid-19 as well, India's growth curve shows a declining trend.From 8.26% in FY17, GDP growth plunged to 3.74% in FY20. Shutdown of economic activities in FY21 in wake of Covid-19 only made matters worse.As lockdowns started to ease and business activities resumed, India's GDP also started rising. In Q1 of FY22, growth jumped to 20.1% mainly on account of low base effect. By the fourth quarter of FY22, growth came down to 4.10%.Similarly, the new financial year 2022-23 brought fresh economic challenges in the form of Russia-Ukraine war that impacted almost all major economies of the world, slowed the pace of growth, pushed inflation to record highs.As a result, the central banks of all advanced economies spurred into action and opted for monetary policy tightening to curb the soaring inflation.With persistently rising interest rates, India's economy grew by 4.4% in Q3 of FY23, as the Centre revised upwards GDP growth for previous year to 9.10% from 8.7% earlier.The report weighed recent GDP numbers against the available data on savings and investments for the past decade and highlighted some interesting points.""Quarterly growth numbers are noisy and should be best avoided for any serious interpretation (on an average, India's GDP growth has witnessed Rs 2 lakh crore upward revision for the 3 year ended FY23),"" the report said.Gross capital formation (GCF) by the government touched a high of 11.8% in 2021-22, up from 10.7% in 2020-21.""This also had a domino effect on private sector investment that jumped from 10 per cent to 10.8% over the same period,"" it said.In fact, Ecowrap added that the trends in GCF to gross output ratio or the plough back of funds for creation of fresh capacity shows that for public administration the ratio attained fresh peak in 2021-22 owing to the emphasis on capital expenditure in recent budgets.At the aggregate level, gross capital formation is supposed to have crossed 32% in 2022-23, the highest level since 2018-19.According to the report, in 2021-22, gross savings have risen to 30% from 29% in 2020-21.""The ratio is supposed to have crossed 31 per cent in 2022-23, the highest since 2018-19. The household savings increased sharply during the pandemic period on account of sharp accretion in financial savings such as deposits,"" said the report by SBI's Economic Research Department.While household financial savings have since then moderated from 15.4% in 2020-21 to 11.1% in 2022-23, savings in physical assets have grown sharply to 11.8% in 2021-22 from 10.7% in 2020-21.The report further analysed Incremental Capital Output ratio (ICOR) -- which measures additional units of capital (investment) needed to produce additional units of output. It said that the ratio has been improving.""ICOR which was 7.5 in FY 12 is now only 3.5 in FY22. Clearly, only half of capital is now needed for next unit of output,"" the report noted.Such reducing ICOR in the current years reflects a relatively increasing efficiency of capital and shows that the economy is on a sound footing, the report said.""From that point of view, future GDP growth rates even at 7% could still mean a decent number by any standards!,"" it added.","India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.

An employee is entitled for a 50 per cent amount of the last drawn salary as pension.OPS was discontinued by the NDA government in 2003 with effect from April 1, 2004.Under the new pension scheme (NPS), employees contribute 10 per cent of their basic salary towards pension while the government contributes 14 per cent.Governments of Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand have informed the central government/ Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority ( PFRDA about their decision to restart OPS for their employees.The government of Punjab on November 18, 2022, issued a notification regarding implementation of OPS for the state government employees who are being covered under NPS. Jharkhand too has decided to revert to OPS.",Former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan has expressed his concern over the decision of some states to restart the old pension scheme.

The meeting was chaired by Food Secretary Sanjeev Chopra.Out of the total wheat procurement target for the 2022-23 marketing year (April-March), Punjab will aim to procure 2.5 million tonnes wheat, Haryana 1.5 million tonnes and Madhya Pradrsh 2 million tonnes, the food ministry said in a statement.Wheat procurement had declined last year due to a fall in domestic production and higher exports.However, the government has projected a record wheat production at 112.18 million tonnes in the 2023-24 crop year (July-June) as per the second estimate of the agriculture ministry.Besides wheat, the government has also fixed rabi (winter) rice procurement target at 10.6 million tonnes in the 2022-23 marketing year.States have been advised to enhance rice milling capacity so that milling of one season gets completed before the commencement of next season and recycling of rice may be avoided.Whereas procurement of millets and coarse grains is estimated to be 7,50,000 tonnes this year, higher than 6,30,000 tonnes in 2021-22. Karnataka will procure 6,00,000 tonnes of millets this year, the statement added.Separately addressing the conference, food minister Piyush Goyal urged all state governments to implement smart-PDS at the earliest.He lauded Andhra Pradesh government's Command Control and stated that the central government will work together for implementing it in other states also.On the storage front, the Union minister said FCI is upgrading godowns into five-star rated ones and state governments can also upgrade their godowns.In the conference, all the state governments were told to learn from the best practice of using millets in schemes like mid-day meal and PDS in Karnataka, which is helpful in adding nutrition and promoting healthy diet.States were encouraged to procure more millets and coarse grains. All the state governments were asked to open procurement centres for coarse grains in producing districts, especially, in tribal areas. State governments were asked to encourage consumption of coarse grains as well.The conference also deliberated on fighting anaemia and nutritional deficiencies in various parts of the country by suitably creating awareness on benefits of fortified rice.The issues related to smart Public Distribution System (PDS) and One Nation One Ration Card scheme for seamless delivery of foodgrains to migrant beneficiaries were also discussed.FCI (Food Corporation of India) is the government's nodal agency that undertakes procurement and distribution of foodgrains for the PDS and welfare schemes.The best practice of command control centre by Andhra Pradesh for real time data on procurement, storage, quality and distribution of foodgrains was also discussed, for which all states have been urged to learn and adopt the methods to make their systems effective and efficient.Further, implementation of additional minimum threshold parameters for online procurement operations, i.e. integration of power validation of milled rice quantity with electricity consumption and tracking of vehicles used for transporting food grains were also deliberated upon for improving efficiency and transparency in procurement operations.During the discussion, it emerged that sufficient jute bags are available as per requirement of ensuing season. Issues related to finalisation of audited accounts, food subsidy claims and rationalisation of food subsidy was also deliberated upon.State governments have also been asked to submit their pending bills to FCI so that those can be settled in March 2023.",The government has fixed a wheat procurement target of 34.15 million tonnes for the 2023-24 marketing year starting April.

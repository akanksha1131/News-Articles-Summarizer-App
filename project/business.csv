Universal Pension Scheme

Universal Pension Scheme : India is exploring a nationwide voluntary pension initiative that would provide social security coverage to all citizens, according to officials. Initial discussions have begun at the labour and employment ministry regarding this comprehensive pension programme.Officials indicate that the fundamental structure of the scheme, under the Employees' Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO), is currently under development.The objective is to provide benefits to workers in the unorganised sector, traders, self-employed individuals, and any person aged 18 and above who wishes to receive pension benefits after turning 60.""The scheme, which would be voluntary and contributory, will not be tied to employment and hence will be open for everyone to contribute and earn a pension,"" a senior government official told ET.Following the planning phase, the ministry will engage with stakeholders to finalise the Universal Pension Scheme details.The initiative aims to incorporate existing central schemes to enhance their appeal and simplify procedures whilst expanding coverage across society.The government is considering consolidating various pension programmes, including PM-SYM and NPS-Traders, into a comprehensive scheme. These optional programmes provide subscribers aged 60 and above with a monthly pension of ₹3,000, based on contributions ranging from ₹55 to ₹200, matched by government funding.Also Read | What is LIC Smart Pension Plan? Top 10 FAQs answered on new retirement planning scheme The unified scheme might incorporate the Atal Pension Yojana , which is presently overseen by PFRDA.The proposal suggests utilising the cess collected through the Building and Other Construction Workers Act to provide pensions for construction industry workers.The central government may encourage states to integrate their pension schemes into this unified programme, ensuring equitable distribution of government contributions, enhanced pension amounts and elimination of duplicate beneficiaries.By 2036, India's elderly population (aged 60 and above) is projected to reach 227 million, constituting 15% of the total population, increasing to 347 million (20%) by 2050.Several developed nations, including the US, Europe, Canada, Russia and China, maintain comprehensive social insurance systems encompassing social security, pensions, healthcare and unemployment benefits.Currently, India's social security framework primarily comprises the provident fund system, alongside old-age pensions and health insurance provided by the Centre to specific beneficiaries, predominantly those living below the poverty line.","The objective is to provide benefits to workers in the unorganised sector, traders, self-employed individuals, and any person aged 18 and above who wishes to receive pension benefits after turning 60.

Latest income tax calculation post Budget 2025: Starting April 1, 2025, individuals earning up to Rs 12 lakh in taxable income under the new income tax regime will not need to pay any tax. For those earning above this threshold, there are ways to structure their salary to maintain taxable income below Rs 12 lakh. Various allowances within the new income tax regime can assist in reducing the taxable income to this limit.ET quotes Harsh Bhuta, Partner of Bhuta Shah & Co., a tax consulting firm as saying, ""Under the new tax regime, there are certain allowances in the Income Tax Act that can help taxpayers to rejig their salary structure. These allowances are exempt from tax in the new tax regime if certain conditions are met. These allowances can help taxpayers to reduce taxable income under the new tax regime.""Also Read | ITR filing with latest income tax slabs post Budget 2025: Will taxpayers with income below Rs 12 lakh have to file tax return? Employers can reimburse work-related travel expenses incurred by employees. Bhuta says, ""The conveyance reimbursement received by an employee is exempt if the same is expended while commuting to the workplace. An employee is required to submit bills to claim reimbursement.""This provision applies to specially-abled individuals. Unlike conveyance reimbursement, this allowance covers travel between home and workplace. Bhuta says, ""The transport allowance received by specially-abled employees is exempted up to Rs 3,200 per month or Rs 38,400 per annum. Only those specially-abled employees are exempted if they are blind/deaf/dumb or orthopaedically handicapped with a disability of the lower extremities.""Salaried employees can receive tax exemptions for reimbursed telephone bills. According to Yogesh Kale, Executive Director of Nangia Andersen LLP, ""There is no limit prescribed concerning the exemption of telephone and internet bills under either of the old or new income tax regimes. However, as an ideal practice, the reimbursement amount should be reasonable, considering an employee's designation and the roles and responsibilities.""He further explains, ""As telephone and internet expenses generally go hand in hand, many employers provide exemptions in respect of internet reimbursements to employees under the income tax rules, though the said rules provide that telephone expenses incurred by the employer on behalf of the employees do not qualify as perquisites in the old or new tax regime and do not specifically mention internet expenses.""Also Read | New vs old income tax regime after Budget 2025: 8 salary perks to save around Rs 1.35 lakh income tax under old regime Staff members have the option to restructure their salary packages to incorporate telephone, mobile and internet bill reimbursements, potentially lowering their taxable income.Employers' car leasing arrangements can contribute to reducing taxable salary. When an employer provides a vehicle for both personal and official use, it is classified as a perquisite under the Income Tax Act.Kale explains, ""The perquisite value of a car given by the employer for the employee's personal and official use as per the income tax rules is very low. The valuation mechanism remains the same under the old and new regimes. The taxable value of such perquisite is Rs 1,800 per month if the engine's cubic capacity does not exceed 1.6 litres. An amount of Rs 2,400 per month would be taxable if the engine's cubic capacity exceeds 1.6 litres.""He continues, ""An amount of Rs 900 per month is added to the value of perquisite if the chauffeur is also provided to run the car. (Employees should remember that expenses on maintenance and running are met or reimbursed by the employer.) Thus, the amount taxable as perquisite in respect of a car given by the employer for the employee's personal and official use is much less as compared to the actual amount of expenditure that may be incurred by the employer.""The analysis presents two scenarios with varying basic salary percentages (30% and 40% of CTC). Higher basic salary percentages within the CTC enable greater tax savings at elevated CTC levels. Tax exemptions apply to mobile and conveyance reimbursements when bills are submitted timely to employers. Both cases include employer NPS contributions at 14% of basic salary under the new regime.The net taxable income reduces to Rs 12 lakh in both instances. This reduction occurs through submission of mobile and conveyance bills, claiming the Rs 75,000 standard deduction under the new regime, and employer NPS contributions under Section 80CCD (2) of the Income Tax Act.These calculations exclude additional income sources like share dividends, savings account interest, and fixed deposit returns. Including these would alter the final calculations.Kale states, ""The new tax regime from FY 2025-26 (AY 2026-27) offers lower tax rates but limits many salary-based exemptions and deductions. Although options such as the ones discussed above provide a bit of scope for reducing the tax burden, the opportunities are more limited than under the old regime.""Under the new regime, meal coupons (Sodexo) from employers are taxable, whereas the old regime allowed tax exemption up to Rs 26,400 yearly (Rs 2,200 per month).Also Read | Income Tax Slabs FY 2025-26 explained: 20 FAQs individual taxpayers should check to understand tax rates, income tax benefit under new tax regime",Several allowances are available for taxpayers to restructure their salary and lower their taxable income.

New Income Tax Bill 2025 : Representing a historic milestone in India’s tax landscape, Hon. Finance Minister – Madam Nirmala Sitharaman has presented the Income Tax Bill, 2025 (Bill) in the Parliament on 13 February 2025.The current Income tax law - Income Tax Act, 1961 (the current Act) was enacted more than six decades ago. With passage of time there were multiple amendments made to the law. Many believed this resulted in the current Act becoming difficult to read, complex to interpret and resulted in unwarranted litigation as well. Hence, it was indeed an opportune time to embark on an exercise to simplify the same. While an attempt was made to this effect a decade ago with the draft Direct Tax Code (DTC) – it never became legislation.Globally as well, countries like the UK, Australia etc., had undertaken similar exercises to enhance clarity and compliance in their taxation laws. Hence, a new simplified income tax law in India was definitely the need of the hour.Also Read | ITR filing with latest income tax slabs post Budget 2025: Will taxpayers with income below Rs 12 lakh have to file tax return? The Bill is prepared by investing more than 60,000 man-hours and has 23 chapters and 2.6 lakh words in comparison to 46 chapters and 5.12 lakh words respectively when compared with the Current Act. The number of Sections has also dramatically reduced from 800 plus sections to 536 Sections only.Secondly the language used in the Bill at many places is extremely lucid and is reader friendly as it has tables and formulas as against the traditional verbose style.One of the most significant aspects of the Bill is the elimination of the concepts of ‘previous year’ and ‘assessment year’. India is trying to join the league of comparable tax jurisdictions by using one single term ‘tax year’. The current terms of previous year and assessment year was apparently leading to mistakes by taxpayers while filing forms/ challans etc. With now only one term “tax year” it will hopefully avoid confusion.Largely, there are no changes to the definition of residency or even salary related provisions for that matter. In fact the choice of the two tax regimes continues to be available to individual taxpayers. There is no change to the tax rates and capital gains tax regime also remains the same.Also Read | New Income Tax Bill 2025 explained: Top 30 FAQs every taxpayer should check TDS and TCS provisions have been made easier to comprehend by providing tables instead of the existing provisions which have lengthy texts that are open to interpretation issues and quite often difficult to understand. The Bill now also gives the ability for individuals to apply for a Lower or NIL rate of TCS while they purchase a car, pay for foreign tour, or make remittance abroad under the Liberalised Remittance Scheme (LRS) of the Reserve Bank of India.It is also interesting to note that elaborate provisions have been enunciated for dealing with transition from the current Act to the new law.There is a clear focus on encouragement of compliance with the mantra of “Trust first, scrutinize later” – as stated by Hon. FM in her recent Feb 2025 Budget speech.As and when the Bill is enacted, the administrative measures for implementing them will be made operational (e.g., publishing of rules, IT infrastructure revamp etc.), keeping in mind the convenience of taxpayers and all stakeholders. For the common man, it is anticipated that the Bill will help in easy understanding of law and smoother tax compliances.","The current Income tax law - Income Tax Act, 1961 (the current Act) was enacted more than six decades ago.

Buffett’s assurance on cash reserves

Big bets on Japan’s trading giants

Berkshire Hathaway’s outlook

Billionaire investor Warren Buffett has reassured shareholders regarding Berkshire Hathaway’s substantial cash reserves, signaling that the funds will be strategically deployed to fuel future growth.Addressing concerns about the company’s massive $321.4 billion cash pile, Buffett, in his annual letter to shareholders, dismissed speculations that it signals an impending economic downturn. He emphasized his plans to make significant investments, particularly in one major emerging market.Despite the growing cash reserves, Buffett clarified that Berkshire Hathaway’s focus remains firmly on equity investments. He explained that while the firm’s cash reserves have reached unprecedented levels, the majority of Berkshire’s value remains tied up in equities, with no intention to shift away from this strategy. As of the last quarter, Berkshire had refrained from stock buybacks for the second consecutive period, leading some analysts to speculate that Buffett didn’t see the company’s stock as undervalued. However, Buffett reassured that the company’s core preference for equities would not change.Buffett also revealed where some of this enormous cash reserve will be allocated. Berkshire Hathaway has already made significant investments in Japan, particularly in the country’s five largest trading houses: Itochu, Marubeni, Mitsubishi, Mitsui, and Sumitomo. These companies, known as ""sogo shosha,"" are involved in diverse sectors ranging from commodities to shipping and steel. Buffett expressed confidence in these firms, citing their strong integration into Japan’s economy and their diversified business models, which closely mirror Berkshire Hathaway’s investment philosophy.Buffett indicated that Berkshire would likely increase its stake in these companies over time, noting that they had agreed to allow Berkshire to surpass the 9.9% ownership limit previously set. By the end of 2024, Berkshire’s holdings in these Japanese trading houses had reached $23.5 billion, with the potential for further growth. Buffett’s long-term vision for these investments reflects his strategy of investing in businesses he understands and trusts.Berkshire Hathaway’s total market value surpassed $1 trillion for the first time in 2024, a milestone that Buffett attributed to the company’s culture of long-term reinvestment and compounding returns. Despite a slight decline in profits, from $96.2 billion to $89 billion, Buffett encouraged investors to focus on operating earnings, which saw a significant rise from $37.4 billion to $47.4 billion in 2023.Buffett reiterated the importance of reinvesting Berkshire’s revenues, rather than paying dividends, which has yielded substantial returns over time. He credited the success of this approach to the power of compounding and sustained savings.","Billionaire investor Warren Buffett has reassured shareholders regarding Berkshire Hathaway’s substantial cash reserves.

Pi coin surges after Open Mainnet launch: Can it reach $100 or $500 by 2030?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/pi-coin-surges-after-open-mainnet-launch-can-it-reach-100-or-500-by-2030/articleshow/118563592.cms,"Pi coin (Photo: ET)

Can Pi coin reach $100?

Will Pi Coin ever hit $500?

What’s Next for Pi Coin?

Pi Network officially launched its Open Mainnet on February 20, 2025, marking a shift from a closed ecosystem to full decentralization. The launch resulted in price fluctuations, with Pi Coin initially surging to $1.97, before dipping to $0.737, and then rebounding 80% to $1.29.As of February 24, 2025, Pi Coin is trading at around $1.55, with a 24-hour trading volume exceeding $1.18 billion.Despite still being far from the $10 mark, some crypto analysts believe Pi Coin has significant growth potential, especially if adoption increases and major exchanges begin listing it. OKX has already announced plans to enable Pi Coin trading once the network meets its listing criteria and completes a successful transition. Market experts suggest that for Pi Coin to hit the $100 mark, it will need robust demand, increased trading liquidity, and widespread adoption as a digital asset.Looking ahead, reports like those from Fortune India suggest that if Pi Network evolves into a widely accepted digital currency with real-world use cases, its price could potentially exceed $500 by 2030. However, this depends on various factors, including continuous development, mass adoption, and regulatory compliance. Analysts warn that Pi Coin's long-term growth could face challenges without strong real-world utility and developer engagement.Following its Open Mainnet launch , the focus now shifts to whether Pi Coin can maintain momentum and attract wider adoption. While this is a significant step forward, Pi Coin’s future will depend on its ability to build utility and trust among users and investors. The trajectory of Pi Coin will be influenced by how the network navigates challenges in a competitive and regulatory-heavy environment, ultimately determining whether it can surge towards $100, $500, or beyond.Disclaimer: Recommendations, views, and opinions expressed by experts are their own and do not reflect the views of The Times of India.","Pi Network officially launched its Open Mainnet on February 20, 2025.

The talks are happening following the UK general elections, which resulted in the Labour Party coming to power. The talks were launched on January 13, 2022.""I am very encouraged by the progress we have been able to make,"" Reynolds told PTI.The two countries are actively negotiating at three different fronts - FTA, bilateral investment treaty (BIT), and a Double Contribution Convention Agrement.""I gave assurances about the strengths of our commitment to the FTA and the investment treaty...,"" the UK Secretary of State for Business and Trade added.Further, he noted that the two economies are complementary in terms of services, and goods.""This (India) is such an important market for UK goods,"" he said adding huge demand is also there in the UK for Indian goods and services.Goyal has said that the agreement will be ""pathbreaking"" and would provide huge opportunities to grow ""our current USD 20 billion bilateral trade in merchandise to probably two or three times in the next 10 years"".He added that enthusiasm is there in both the countries about the FTA.

China’s push for self-driving innovation

Tesla began rolling out advanced self-driving features for its cars in China, marking a milestone after years of regulatory hurdles in the world’s largest automobile market.In an announcement on its WeChat page on Tuesday, the US electric vehicle giant confirmed that a software update would gradually introduce ""automatic autopilot-assisted driving on city streets.""The update also included a rearview mirror function designed to detect whether drivers are paying attention.These features are similar to Tesla’s ""full self driving"" (FSD) capability available in the United States. However, the technology does not make vehicles fully autonomous and still requires driver supervision.Tesla stated that the update had already been released for some models and would be expanded to other compatible vehicles over time.China is a crucial market for Tesla, where it operates two factories and faces increasing competition from domestic manufacturers.The announcement comes shortly after Chinese automaker BYD, Tesla’s biggest rival in the country, revealed plans to introduce advanced self-driving technology across nearly all its models.Tesla has long been working to gain regulatory approval for FSD in China, a process complicated by strict data and privacy laws. CEO Elon Musk has visited the country multiple times in past years, allegedly to secure key data security clearances for Tesla’s locally produced vehicles.Chinese automakers and tech firms have invested heavily in self-driving technology, aiming to compete with industry leaders in the US. While fully autonomous cars are not yet available for purchase, China has approved multiple self-driving taxi services in major cities.In Wuhan, more than 500 driverless taxis operate as part of Baidu’s Apollo Go project, offering rides across large parts of the city.Meanwhile, BYD’s ""God’s Eye"" autonomous driving system, previously reserved for high-end vehicles, will soon be available in budget models priced under $10,000, further increasing competition in the market.As Tesla expands its self-driving capabilities in China, it faces an increasingly dynamic landscape where local companies are rapidly advancing their own autonomous technologies.","Tesla began rolling out advanced self-driving features for its cars in China.

Suspicions of North Korean involvement

Dubai-based cryptocurrency exchange Bybit suffered a heavy breach after hackers gained access to a wallet containing Ethereum and stole $1.5 billion.Despite what is believed to be the largest single digital heist in history, Bybit has reassured customers that their funds remain safe. CEO Ben Zhou confirmed on social media that the company would fully refund all affected users, even if the stolen assets are not recovered.“Bybit is solvent even if this hack loss is not recovered, all of clients assets are 1 to 1 backed, we can cover the loss,” Zhou posted on X.He added that Bybit holds $20bn in customer assets and can absorb the financial hit independently or through partner loans.Bybit, the second-largest crypto exchange by trading volume, has over 60 million users worldwide. News of the hack triggered a flood of withdrawal requests, with more than 350,000 users attempting to pull their funds, causing delays in processing.The attack took place during a routine transfer of Ethereum from an offline ""cold"" wallet to a ""warm"" wallet, which is used for daily trading. The CEO said that hackers exploited security controls to access the funds, though all other wallets remain unaffected.In what is believed to be the largest single digital heist in history, the attackers transferred the crypto to an unknown address, as per The GuardianFollowing the news, the price of Ethereum dropped nearly 4 per cent on Friday, but has since rebounded.Now, the company appeals to all “the brightest minds in cybersecurity and crypto analytics worldwide to help it recover the lost asset.Additionally, it is offering a 10 per cent bounty on recovered funds, meaning a potential $140m payout in case the full amount is retrieved. The company has called on leading cybersecurity and crypto analytics experts to assist in tracking down the stolen assets.“Bybit is determined to rise above the setback and fundamentally transform our security infrastructure, improve liquidity, and be a steadfast partner to our friends in the crypto community,” Zhou stated.While the hacker's identity remains unknown, some reports suggest links to North Korean state-sponsored groups, such as the Lazarus Group, which has been linked with large-scale crypto heists, including the $615m Ronin Network hack in 2022.The attack is a major blow to the crypto industry, which had been experiencing a resurgence, partly driven by Donald Trump’s return to the White House and his promise to make the US the ""crypto capital of the planet"" through relaxed regulations.","Bybit, the second-largest crypto exchange by trading volume, has over 60 million users worldwide.

AI server facility in Texas

Apple's Quarter Performance

Aligned with tariff strategy to boost US Economy

Apple has announced that it will invest $500 billion in the United States over the next four years. The investment will include a massive AI server factory in Texas and the creation of approximately 20,000 research and development jobs across the country.This $500 billion in expected spending will encompass everything from US supplier purchases to the filming of television shows and movies for Apple TV+, news agency Reuters reported.The company did not specify how much of the figure was already planned for its US supply base, which includes partners like Corning, which manufactures glass for iPhones in Kentucky.Apple CEO Tim Cook confirmed that this plan is part of the company's commitment to support American innovation, advanced manufacturing, and high tech job creation.“As a proud American company, we're thrilled to continue to make significant investments in the US. Today, we’re announcing a $500 billion commitment to support American innovation, advanced manufacturing, and high tech job creation.” Tim Cook posted on X.The announcement follows media reports that Apple CEO Tim Cook met with President Donald Trump last week.Trump, who has pushed US companies to shift manufacturing home, claimed that his administration was to thank for the investment.""The reason, faith in what we are doing, without which, they wouldn't be investing ten cents. Thank you Tim Cook and Apple!!!"" Trump wrote in capital letters on his Truth Social platform.Many of Apple’s products, which are assembled in China, may face 10% tariffs imposed earlier this month, though Apple secured some tariff exemptions during Trump’s first term.""This pledge represents a political gesture towards the Trump administration,"" said Gil Luria told Reuters, analyst at D.A. Davidson, adding that the $500 billion is likely to cover all of Apple's US expenditures, including general and administrative costs. It remains unclear whether this marks an acceleration in Apple's spending plans.Apple made a similar announcement in 2018, pledging $350 billion in US investments over five years during Trump’s first term.Following the latest news, Apple's shares were down 0.8% in pre-market trading, according to Reuters. Although most Apple products are assembled outside the US many of its components, such as chips from Broadcom SkyWorks Solutions, and Qorvo are made domestically.Apple also revealed it has begun mass production of its own-designed chips at an Arizona facility owned by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. The move is part of Apple's continued investment in US manufacturing , which aligns with the CHIPS Act, a key industrial policy introduced during Trump's first term.In addition to the AI server facility in Texas, Apple plans to collaborate with Foxconn to build a 250,000-square-foot plant in Houston. This facility will assemble servers for Apple Intelligence, its suite of AI-powered features. These servers are currently manufactured outside the US, according to Reuters.The company also announced plans to expand its Advanced Manufacturing Fund from $5 billion to $10 billion, with a multibillion-dollar commitment to producing advanced silicon at TSMC's Arizona plant.Apple will also establish a manufacturing academy in Michigan to offer free courses in project management and process optimization for small and mid-sized manufacturing firms.In January, Apple CEO Tim Cook celebrated the company's ""best quarter ever,"" with quarterly profits reaching $36.3 billion. The Americas continued to be Apple's largest market, generating $56.2 billion in revenue, while Europe showed strong growth with $33.9 billion in earnings, according to AFP.Apple aims to attract customers with its latest iPhone models powered by new AI capabilities. This move aligns with other tech giants, such as Google, Microsoft, and Amazon, which are increasing investments in generative AI, seeing it as the next frontier of computing.Apple's announcement follows comments from President Donald Trump, who praised Apple's plans to invest ""hundreds of billions of dollars"" in the US as evidence of his tariff strategy's success in boosting the American economy. Trump's administration has used tariffs as a trade weapon, imposing 10% levies on Chinese goods and threatening tariffs on products like semiconductors, cars, and pharmaceuticals. While the administration argues these tariffs encourage US manufacturing, critics warn they could raise consumer prices.","Apple will invest $500 billion in the United States over the next four years.

US President Donald Trump hinted towards a “possible” trade deal with one of its key targets for tariff policies, China.Trump told the Air Force One reporters that during his first tenure in 2020, the country had already agreed on what he described as ""a great trade deal with China.""Beijing also urged Washington to handle trade disputes with ""mutual respect,"" with the Chinese foreign ministry responding on Thursday that both sides should resolve their concerns through ""dialogue and consultation based on equality and mutual respect.""Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun warned that "" trade and tariff wars have no winners and only serve to damage the interests of people all over the world.""One month since he assumed office, Trump has doubled down on tariffs, targeting not just China but also key trading partners like Canada, Mexico, and the European Union. Earlier this month, he imposed an additional 10 per cent duty on all Chinese imports and is now considering further levies, including a potential 25 per cent tariff on lumber.Meanwhile, China has also hit back with retaliatory tariffs, slapping 15 per cent duties on US coal and liquefied natural gas, and 10 per cent on oil, agricultural machinery, and vehicles. China's commerce ministry urged Washington to refrain from using tariffs as a ""tool for coercion.""However, experts warned that in such a trade war, it is usually the US which has to bear the cost of tariffs.The US President said, “there's a little bit of competitiveness, but the relationship I have with President Xi (Jinping) is, I would say, a great one,"" He further revealed that Xi, along with the leaders of France and Britain, could soon visit Washington for talks.Trump's aggressive tariff strategy has sent shockwaves across global markets.

Japanese trade minister Yoji Muto is expected to visit Washington to call for an exemption, according to Japanese media reports.In Europe, the EU has warned of a firm response if Washington imposes tariffs on its goods.European Commission vice president Maros Sefcovic dismissed Trump’s claims of unfair trade ties, calling US-EU relations a ""win-win partnership.""

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume.

The startup has a total of 18 employees and is just opening an office in the city.""What we are showing is that you can build large language models with limited resources,” Raghavan said in a phone interview. ""We are building at a smaller scale and demonstrating that these can be extremely cost and energy efficient so they can be accessed by everyone.""Large language models, like OpenAI’s GPT-4 and Meta Platforms Inc.’s Llama, are powerful AI systems that understand by learning from vast amounts of diverse data from the internet and elsewhere to summarize, translate, and create text, audio and video for a wide range of applications. The rivalry to develop ever-more sophisticated models is heating up in Silicon Valley and such efforts have attracted billions of dollars in investments.","Sarvam AI is building large language models targeted at unique uses in Indian languages at price points that the country’s 1.4 billion people can afford.

Startups will play important role in helping India become 3rd largest economy: CEA Nageswaran,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/startups-will-play-important-role-in-helping-india-become-3rd-largest-economy-cea-nageswaran/articleshow/105332523.cms,"Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor ( CEA ) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran Udaan until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.Udaan built an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business still accounts for a very small part of India’s overall retail market but can balloon to $150 billion in sales and yield a 100% return on capital invested in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co. estimates published in the Mint newspaper.Bengaluru-based Udaan has also ventured into financing through its fintech unit which helps shopkeepers get working capital loans to buy inventory. That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says.

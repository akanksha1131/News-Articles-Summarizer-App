Varun Beverages Ltd delivered strong 1QCY24 performance with 29% YoY revenue growth, driven by robust 30% volume growth (15.5% organic). While margins remained flat YoY at 22.7% due to lower-margin South Africa consolidation, domestic demand stayed healthy with double-digit growth. Management remains confident in long-term double-digit volume growth, supported by distribution expansion (visi-coolers) and a shift towards healthier beverages (nimbooz +100% YoY). International markets, though margin-dilutive, offer scale-up potential. We maintain BUY (55x CY26E EPS), projecting 18%/16%/26% revenue/EBITDA/PAT CAGRs over CY25-26. As PepsiCo’s key franchisee, VBL is well-placed to capitalize on India’s underpenetrated beverage market and rural refrigeration growth.JSW Infrastructure concluded FY25 with strong growth in cargo volumes of 117Mn tons (+9% YoY). Revenue rose 19% YoY to ₹44.8Bn, while APAT grew ~22% YoY, reflecting steady progress toward its 400 MTPA port capacity goal by FY30.Boosted by Navkar acquisition, the logistics segment targets ₹80b revenue by FY30. With a strong balance sheet and positive outlook, the company is poised to benefit from India’s infrastructure growth and rising third-party cargo demand despite global headwinds. We expect JSWINFRA to strengthen its market dominance, leading to 13% volume CAGR over FY25-27. This, along with a sharp rise in logistics revenues, is expected to drive revenue/EBITDA/APAT CAGR of 22%/23%/18% over FY25-27.","According to Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd, the top stock picks for the week (starting May 5, 2025) are Varun Beverages and JSW Infrastructure.

ITR filing FY 2024-25: New ITR-1 form notified with major changes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/taxation/itr-filing-fy-2024-25-new-itr-1-form-notified-with-major-changes-heres-what-taxpayers-should-know/articleshow/120785747.cms,"ITR filing: For individuals and those not requiring account audits, the submission deadline remains July 31.

ITR-1 for income tax return FY 2024-25:

Salaried individuals and those under the presumptive taxation scheme can now file ITR-1 and ITR-4 respectively if their long-term capital gains (LTCG) are within Rs 1.25 lakh per fiscal year. Previously, these categories were required to file ITR-2.

According to I-T regulations, LTCG up to Rs 1.25 lakh from listed shares and mutual funds remains tax-exempt. Any gains above Rs 1.25 lakh annually attract a 12.5 per cent tax.

Similar to the previous version, ITR-1 requires individuals to provide information about foreign travel expenses surpassing Rs 2 lakh for themselves or others.

Additionally, it requires disclosure of electricity consumption costs exceeding Rs 1 lakh during the previous fiscal period.

What does the new ITR-1 mean for taxpayers?

New ITR forms for FY 2024-25: The Income Tax Department has issued a new ITR-1 and ITR-4 for tax filing purposes for the assessment year 2025-26, simplifying the process for individuals with long term capital gains up to Rs 1.25 lakh from listed equities.The forms include modifications regarding deductions under sections 80C, 80GG and others, featuring a drop down menu in the utility. Additionally, taxpayers must provide detailed section-wise information for TDS deductions.Tax filing can commence once the I-T department releases the utility for the 2024-25 fiscal year. For individuals and those not requiring account audits, the submission deadline remains July 31.Typically, ITR forms are released before the fiscal year ends, around February/March. This year's delay in form notification and filing utility occurred because revenue department officials were engaged with the new Income Tax Bill, presented to Parliament in February.Also Check | Latest income tax slabs FY 2025-26: What are the new income tax slabs, rates after Budget 2025 announcements?

Earlier, for any capital gains, the taxpayers were mandatorily required to file ITR-2/ITR-3 etc. as applicable”“Further, the new ITR-1/ ITR-4 forms, require the taxpayer to only report the total sales consideration, cost and amount of LTCG, as against the detailed disclosures required In Form ITR-2, ITR-3 etc., even though the LTCG within this limit is not taxable. This is a welcome measure towards simplifying tax compliance and reporting by taxpayers within this category,” she said.According to Samir Kanabar, Tax Partner at EY India, this move reflects a clear shift towards enhancing taxpayer services by allowing individual taxpayers to file simplified tax return where they have long-term capital gains up to Rs 1.25 lacs.“Thereby, it removes the burden of navigating more complex forms. The change is expected to encourage greater voluntary compliance, reduce filing-related stress, and make the system more inclusive and user-friendly for small taxpayers. We hope that this is just the beginning towards better compliance and simplification and expect more to come,” he said.“Forms ITR-1 and ITR-4 for Assessment Year 2025-26 remain largely consistent with the previous year. Notably, the updated forms bring relief to individuals with long-term capital gains taxable under Section 112A of the Income Tax Act provided these gains do not exceed the threshold of ₹1.25 lakhs, as earlier such taxpayers had to file return in ITR 2/ITR 3, which are more detailed forms. This is a welcome move by the Government and marks a positive step toward improving taxpayer services by allowing individuals within this category to file a simplified return which was not allowed till last year,” says Divya Baweja, Partner, Deloitte India.Sandeep Jhunjhunwala, Tax Partner at Nangia Andersen LLP stated that previously, salaried individuals with capital gains income needed to file ITR-2, even when these gains were exempt under Section 112A's threshold limit, necessitating comprehensive disclosures including capital gain accrual or receipt information and securities details.Also Read | Save up to Rs 1.1 lakh!

Billionaire Gautam Adani ’s official representatives have reportedly met with US President Donald Trump 's administration officials. According to a Bloomberg News report, the aim of the meeting was to look at a dismissal of criminal charges against Gautam Adani in the foreign bribery investigation.The discussions, which commenced in early 2025, have intensified in recent weeks, with potential resolution anticipated within approximately a month, provided the current momentum continues, the report said.US authorities filed charges against Adani and his nephew, Sagar Adani , in November, alleging their involvement in bribery for Indian power supply contracts and providing misleading information to US investors during fundraising activities.The SEC called upon Gautam Adani and his nephew regarding accusations of paying substantial bribes to Indian officials whilst providing inaccurate antibribery compliance information during an Adani Green Energy bond offering valued at $750 million.Adani's team is presenting arguments that his prosecution does not align with Trump's administrative priorities and warrants reconsideration, according to the report.The report said that representatives from the Adani Group , Justice Department and White House declined to comment on the matter.The Adani Group, White House, and U.S. DOJ have not provided immediate responses to Reuters' enquiries.Adani Green announced in late March that their assessment of the US indictment revealed no compliance violations or irregularities.","US authorities filed charges against Adani and his nephew, Sagar Adani, in November, alleging their involvement in bribery for Indian power supply contracts.

BENGALURU: Even as the professional landscape reflects a growing synergy between human and autonomous agents, Arundhati Bhattacharya, president & CEO of Salesforce - South Asia, said the advent of this synergy created new job roles, including unstructured engineers, ML engineers, and prompt engineers.She said that while the transition might cause some pain in the industry with some skills made redundant, it would eventually lead to the creation of new employment opportunities. ""There will be some pain in transition. There always is. But at the end of the day, you will find many new jobs being created, jobs that were not there at all. We didn't know about retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) till recently. We didn't have this many ethics officers or compliance officers. So, the nature of jobs will change,"" Bhattacharya said here on Friday.Last year, Salesforce unveiled its autonomous AI application, Agentforce, which provides specialised support to employees or customers. Agentforce interacts with customers through multiple channels around the clock in natural language. It defines security guardrails and knows when to seamlessly escalate to human employees.""Agentforce will allow humans to become more human.Instead of wasting time on my screen replying to repetitive stuff, those can be done by the agent while I call a client and talk to them. I use agentic AI in my work life, which assists me in summarising calls and getting the transcript when we are not able to be present on the calls. We have a lot of training sessions, and we were required to pitch to our peers to confirm that the training was complete. Agentforce doesn't give me passing marks just because I'm the boss. It tells me exactly where my tone went wrong and where my language was incorrect. It's very objective,"" Bhattacharya said.Currently, 30% of the code is written by agents. Arun Parameswaran, EVP & MD of sales at Salesforce South Asia , said that 50% of the code will be done by agents by the end of this year. Salesforce's Agentforce, an AI platform that allows organisations to create and deploy autonomous AI agents , has an accuracy of 93% for a European airline client. Regarding Salesforce's own helpline, 84% of the queries are being answered by agents, and the escalation has been reduced by 50%.Among Salesforce's clients is Air India, which recently adopted Agentforce to enhance its user interface. It claims that the refund process of the airline has been drastically reduced with the use of Agentforce.The current macroeconomic stress induced by the tariff wars has not impacted the business, but its clients are in a wait-and-watch mode, Parameswaran said. India continues to be a critical growth market for Salesforce, and the company's expanding investment in the region reflects this commitment. Salesforce has an online learning platform called Trailhead. Its Trailblazer community - including developers, admins, architects, IT leaders, and customer innovators - has over 3.9 million members across India.","Arundhati Bhattacharya, president & CEO of Salesforce - South Asia, said the advent of this synergy created new job roles.

Emkay Global Financial Services has a ‘buy’ rating on Indian Oil with a target price of Rs 170. Analysts said the OMC major beat analysts’ estimates during its Jan-March quarters on several parameters on the back of better marketing margins and refinery inventory gains. The management indicated that FY26 is healthy so far, with stable refining and marketing boosted by lower oil prices. IOCL is engaging with the GoI for LPG compensation as well. Major projects like Panipat, Gujarat, and Barauni expansions would progressively commission during the next two years.Motilal Oswal Financial Services has a ‘buy’ rating on State Bank of India with a target price of Rs 915. Analysts said the banking major reported in-line earnings as higher provisions and opex were offset by higher other income, while margins were broadly stable. The bank’s management expects NIM to remain under pressure due to the rate cuts. However, the bank has some offsetting levers like an increase in CD ratio, a higher MCLR-linked book, and yield benefits from the recent increase in MCLR rates. Credit grew 12% YoY, while the unsecured book (Xpress Credit) saw a flat trend. The bank has seen an increase in its domestic CD ratio. Fresh slippages were contained, which underscores improvements in underwriting standards.Citigroup has a ‘buy’ rating on Indus Towers with a target price of Rs 485. Analysts feel the key positives for the stock are that all the past undisputed overdues from Voda Idea have now been cleared. In addition, free cash flow generation rose in Jan-March quarter. And estimated new tenancies from Voda Idea rose on a quarterly basis. They said Indus Towers has, however, delayed the dividend announcement that was widely expected and has, instead, set up a committee for recommendations to “enhance shareholder returns”. They feel that this delay could weigh on near-term stock performance pending further clarity.Elara Securities India has reiterated its ‘reduce’ rating on CEAT with the target price at Rs 3,153. Analysts said during the Jan-March quarter CEAT’s revenue grew, led by healthy volume growth, while EBITDA margin growth was driven by contraction of raw material costs, and price hikes implemented across two-wheeler tyres. Analysts retained their cautious stance on the tyre sector, given a low EPS CAGR during FY24-FY27, and expectations of structurally high natural rubber prices during FY26-27. We are yet to factor in the CAMSO acquisition.ICICI Securities has a ‘buy’ rating on Nippon Life India Asset Management (Nippon Life Mutual Fund) with the target price at Rs 720. Analysts feel the fund house is one of the better plays on assets under management (AUM) basis industry position, execution track record and valuation. A strong retail franchise and good fund performance have driven market share gains for Nippon Life AMC in equity and SIP flows. The fund house also maintains its industry-leading position in the passive and alternate funds segment.","Emkay Global Financial Services has a ‘buy’ rating on Indian Oil with a target price of Rs 170.

However, by the end of FY25, the bank's total advances rose 12% to cross Rs 42 lakh crore.

Retail personal loans and corporate loans rose 11.4% and 9%, respectively. Home loans, which grew 14%, were the key driver of retail credit.Bank officials said many large central PSUs used equity funding to pare debt, leading to prepayments that couldn't be compensated within a quarter.

'US trade deal mother of all opportunities',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/us-trade-deal-mother-of-all-opportunities/articleshow/120884131.cms,"What is the impact of US tariffs on India's manufacturing ambitions?

People talk about Dixon as the next Foxconn. Do you think that scale can be developed?

Should we partner with suppliers from China, Vietnam and Taiwan?

Your view on China?

NEW DELHI: Dixon Electronics is seen as India's Foxconn and has grown its manufacturing footprint exponentially over the last few years, securing contract- manufacturing orders from some of the world's biggest giants. As Trump tariffs shake up the global manufacturing ecosystem, Dixon chairman Sunil Vachani tells TOI in an interview that ""There is no better place than India right now because we have a large pool of manpower, we give frugal and low-cost manufacturing, we offer high productivity, and all these are backed by strong govt incentives. "" Excerpts:To be honest, the initial opportunity that came our way was when Donald Trump was elected in his first term. Then, everybody was looking at an alternative to our neighbour (China). But, at that time, the Indian industry was not very well prepared and we missed that opportunity as Vietnam surged ahead. This time, the opportunity is much bigger and India is much better prepared. The four years of smartphone production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme helped the Indian industry create a very large scale. As Dixon, we were hardly producing a few million sets of smartphones per year until a few years back, but led by PLI, today we have a capacity to produce almost 70 million devices annually.Our industry's scale (in smartphones) today is comparable to what we see in our neighbouring country. Moreover, our industry is also investing in backward integration. If India really emerges as one of the first countries to have a bilateral trade agreement with the US with zero tariffs, this will be the mother of all opportunities.What do you need for creating a large scale? You need a large pool of trained manpower and modern machines and make sure to achieve the best productivity. India's strength lies in having a large pool of manpower, which is waiting to be employed. All the industry needs to do is invest resources to give requisite training and skills to these people, so that they become extremely productive.As an entrepreneur, if I go and try and reinvent the wheel and develop technologies on display and camera modules, it will take me a very long time. Unfortunately, our industry doesn't have time on our side. Last time we may have lost this opportunity, but this time we don't want to lose it. So, the quickest way and the most efficient way is to tie up with component suppliers, who are already vendors to our customers. We have to agree on a JV structure, which is acceptable to govt. Because security considerations are the most important factor. They will do their vetting, they will do due diligence, and only then will the projects get approved. So, after clearing those hurdles, any partnership that comes through will be a win-win because the Chinese are getting access to a market, which they are not going to have if the tariffs hit Beijing.If you see our story of smartphone manufacturing, we were broadly importers around ten years back or so. For us, this journey has just begun. China is far, far ahead of us in this journey. They've developed huge strengths, including in backward integration and component ecosystem. Over a period of time, we can do it on our own..","Dixon Electronics is seen as India's Foxconn and has grown its manufacturing footprint.

Eyes on electronics imports from China,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/eyes-on-electronics-imports-from-china/articleshow/120884068.cms,"NEW DELHI: Amid fears of a surge in imports from China, the latest data available showed that electronics exports to India, as well as the US, fell in Jan and Feb. While these numbers provided comfort to Indian policymakers, trends in recent weeks - after Trump's tariff actions - also did not show any surge, with a high-level group monitoring shipments from China and Asean, sources familiar with the stepped-up vigil said.The value of the top 10 electronics products exported by Chinese companies to India stayed at $1.8 billion during Jan and Feb. As US President Donald Trump took office at the end of Jan, imports into America halved. In Jan, Chinese shipments of the top 10 electronics items were estimated at $10 billion, which fell to $6 billion in Feb. A part of the reason for the fall could be front-loading of exports by China.China is the biggest source of imports for all goods for India as well as the US, and both run a massive trade deficit, which in India's case was almost $100 billion during the last financial year and remained unabated, despite govt's repeated moves to keep it under check. Electronics, chemicals, steel, consumer durables and other consumer goods are among the top items being monitored by a committee of officials from commerce, revenue, and industry departments along with other ministries.The panel was set up after domestic industry and experts raised alarm bells around a possible surge in imports from China and Asean, many of whose members are seen as proxies for Beijing, as supplies to the US markets became more expensive with tariffs kicking in.""Close monitoring is happening, and so far, there has not been any significant surge,"" an officer said. The full impact of tariffs is, however, expected to kick in only after a few months.A section of Indian industry, especially the small players, however, believes that a lot of the fear expressed by large players is unwarranted. For instance, they argued steel giants created a major noise over a possible import surge from China and lobbied hard with govt to get a 12% safeguard duty on several products.

Fallout at Kohl’s

What’s next for Holt?

Chandra Holt, once considered one of the most promising executives in American retail, is now at the center of a corporate scandal involving her former Walmart colleague, and reported former romantic partner, Ashley Buchanan .Buchanan was fired this week as CEO of Kohl’s after the company accused him of engineering a vendor deal riddled with “undisclosed conflicts of interest.”According to a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, Buchanan directed Kohl’s to enter into a multimillion-dollar contract with a vendor that allegedly had “highly suspicious” and “favorable” terms. The filing did not name the vendor or the individual involved, but The Wall Street Journal identified the woman as Chandra Holt.In a statement to The Journal, Holt confirmed she had known Buchanan for a decade but denied any business wrongdoing. “I’ve known Ashley Buchanan for 10 years, but I have not received any compensation for my Incredibrew business from Kohl’s,” she said.Holt is the founder and CEO of Incredibrew, a coffee brand she launched in 2022 that claims to infuse beverages with vitamins and minerals. It remains unclear whether Incredibrew was the vendor involved in the Kohl’s deal under scrutiny.Buchanan and Holt first crossed paths at Walmart, where they worked closely before departing around the same time for other executive roles. Buchanan left in early 2020 to head arts-and-crafts giant Michaels, while Holt exited in 2021 to become CEO of Conn’s HomePlus.Most recently, she served as CEO of Beyond, Inc, the parent company of Overstock.com and Bed Bath & Beyond, between February 2024 and June 2024.Her impressive résumé includes leadership stints at Target, Sam’s Club, and Walgreens. She holds a Bachelor of Arts in advertising, PR, and communications from the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities, and an MBA in strategy and marketing from the Carlson School of Management.Buchanan’s exit comes amid a challenging period for Kohl’s. The company reported a 7.2% drop in annual sales to $15.4 billion and announced plans to close more than two dozen underperforming stores. The firing triggered serious consequences: Buchanan must now forfeit all equity awards granted during his tenure and repay a prorated portion of his $2.5 million signing bonus.While Kohl’s emphasized that the CEO's termination had “no bearing on the company’s financial performance,” the incident adds turbulence to a company already struggling with leadership instability . Buchanan was the third CEO in as many years, following short-lived tenures by Tom Kingsbury and Michelle Gass.Although no formal allegations have been made against Holt, her name is now linked to a boardroom controversy that could complicate her professional path. With her leadership record and entrepreneurial success through Incredibrew, the coming months may determine whether Holt can distance herself from the scandal or whether her past with Buchanan will cast a longer shadow.","Ashley Buchanan was fired this week as CEO of Kohl’s after the company accused him of engineering a vendor deal riddled with “undisclosed conflicts of interest” Buchanan directed Kohl's to enter into a multimillion-dollar contract with a vendor that allegedly had “highly suspicious” and “favorable” terms.

US approves HawkEye 360 sale to boost India’s surveillance,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/us-approves-hawkeye-360-sale-to-boost-indias-surveillance/articleshow/120859058.cms,"NEW DELHI: In a move to boost New Delhi’s surveillance power amid heightened military tension, the US state department has approved the sale of HawkEye 360 technology to India, which will help the country gain maritime domain awareness in the Indo-Pacific, aided by a growing constellation of satellites in Low Earth Orbit.The proposed sale, the state department statement said, “will improve India's capabilities to meet current and future threats by bolstering its maritime domain awareness, analytical abilities and strategic posture”.A US Defence Security Cooperation Agency statement said New Delhi requested purchase of the SeaVision software, including its preferred software enhancements, training as a technical assistance field team, remote software, analytic support, documents, and other logistics and programme support elements. The estimated total cost is $131 million. “The principal contractor will be Hawkeye360, located in Herndon, Virginia,” the statement said.HawkEye 360, an American geospatial analytics private company, collects and analyses radio frequency (RF) signal location with a constellation of satellites in Low Earth Orbit. These satellites detect and geolocate radio frequency (RF) emissions. They track communication signals from ships, aircraft, vehicles, and coastal systems. Some vessels, which ‘go dark’ to roam undetected in disputed areas and evade tracking after turning off their Automatic Identification System (AIS), can also be detected with this advanced technology.Indian forces can now identify illegal fishing, smuggling and perform effective surveillance in the Indian Ocean Region with the help of this technology.With this technology, India gains deeper visibility across its Exclusive Economic Zone. Currently, the Indian Navy uses P8i reconnaissance aircraft and Sea Guardian drones to monitor strategic locations and detect vessels keeping their AIS switched off.The Hawkeye 360 system uses Electro-Optical (EO), Infrared (IR), and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) as additional layers. Each layer improves detection, verification and classification of threats. EO satellites capture high-resolution daytime imagery; infrared sensors identify thermal emissions from engines and exhausts; and SAR satellites capture radar-based images regardless of weather and time. This layer confirms ship size, speed, and location. The system combines speed, precision, and adaptability and works continuously across all weather and time conditions.“The proposed sale will support the foreign policy and national security objectives of the US by helping to strengthen the US-Indian strategic relationship and to improve the security of a major defence partner, which continues to be an important force for political stability, peace and economic progress in the Indo-Pacific and South Asia regions,” the US statement said.","The HawkEye 360 system uses Electro-Optical (EO), Infrared (IR), and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) as additional layers.

US President Donald Trump is taking credit for any signs of economic strength in the US while blaming President Joe Biden for recent weaknesses, including the first-quarter contraction in GDP. In a wide-ranging interview on NBC News’ “Meet the Press,” Trump also lobbed fresh criticism at Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell , whom he described as “a total stiff,” even as he vowed not to remove him before his term ends in 2026.Trump reiterated his belief that his trade and economic strategies – including sweeping tariffs – are ultimately benefiting Americans, despite recent market volatility and growing concerns about inflation. “I think the good parts are the Trump economy and the bad parts are the Biden economy because he’s done a terrible job,” Trump said. He pointed to falling energy and gasoline prices and a narrowing trade deficit as signs of his policies working.Trump's remarks come amid the most turbulent stretch for Wall Street since the early COVID-19 pandemic, largely sparked by his aggressive tariff strategy. In early April, he imposed a 10% tariff on most countries, higher rates for some trading partners, and reinstated or raised duties on autos, steel, aluminum, and goods from China, which now face a 145% tariff. While officials say negotiations are underway with more than 15 countries to avoid further hikes, Trump has not ruled out making some tariffs permanent.“Why would they build in the United States if they thought [tariffs] were going to come off the table?” Trump asked, claiming credit for trillions in investments from global and domestic companies.Trump shrugged off concerns that higher tariffs could drive up consumer prices. “They don’t need to have 30 dolls,” he said. “They can have three. They don’t need to have 250 pencils. They can have five.”He also claimed that the US has effectively gone “cold turkey” with China on trade and suggested Beijing is eager to strike a new deal. “We’re not losing a trillion dollars ... because we’re not doing business with them right now,” Trump said. “They want to make a deal very badly.”Despite sharp criticism of Powell, Trump issued his clearest signal yet that he does not intend to remove the Fed chair early. “No, no, no,” he said. “Why would I do that? I get to replace the person in another short period of time.”Still, he questioned Powell’s motives and reiterated his desire for lower interest rates. “He should lower them. And at some point, he will,” Trump said. “He’d rather not because he’s not a fan of mine. You know, he just doesn’t like me because I think he’s a total stiff.”","President Donald Trump says he is taking credit for any signs of economic strength in the US.

US President Donald Trump announced on Sunday that he will not remove Jerome Powell as Federal Reserve board chairman before his term ends in May 2026 while describing the central banker as ""a total stiff"" and repeating calls for the Fed to lower interest rates In an interview with ""Meet the Press with Kristen Welker"" on NBC News , Trump said Powell was no fan of his, but he expected the Fed to lower interest rates at some point. ""Well, he should lower them. And at some point, he will. He'd rather not because he's not a fan of mine. You know, he just doesn't like me because I think he's a total stiff,"" he said in the interview, which was taped in Florida on Friday.Asked if he would remove Powell before his term as chair ends in 2026, Trump issued his most definitive denial, saying, ""No, no, no. That was a total – why would I do that? I get to replace the person in another short period of time.""This comes after Wall Street stocks fell sharply last month after Trump doubled down on his attacks against Powell, amplifying concerns about the central bank's autonomy and rattling markets. However last, Trump seemed to softer his stance as he took a step back from his aggressive stance against Fed chair Jerome Powell, making a similar statement that he he had no intention of firing Powell which helped the market recover at the time, just days after calling Powell a ""major loser"" while calling for lowering of federal interest rates.The comments aired on Sunday were the clearest indication yet that the US president would keep Powell in place, which could reassure markets deeply unsettled by Trump's moves to upend the global trading system with a tsunami of tariffs , according to Reuters.On April 2, Trump imposed a 10 per cent tariff on most countries, along with higher tariff rates for many trading partners that were then suspended for 90 days merely days later. He has also imposed 25 per cent tariffs on autos, steel and aluminum, 25 per cent tariffs on Canada and Mexico, and 145 per cent tariffs on China, that still continues.Trump's administration is negotiating with over 15 countries for trade deals that could avert the higher tariffs, and officials, quoted by Reuters say the first deal could be announced soon.Meanwhile, during the interview with NBC News, Trump declined to rule out making some of the tariffs permanent. ""No, I wouldn't do that because if somebody thought they were going to come off the table, why would they build in the United States?"" he said.Trump further acknowledged he had been ""very tough with China,"" essentially cutting off trade between the world's two large economies, but said Beijing now wanted to reach an agreement.""We've gone cold turkey,"" he said. ""That means we're not losing a trillion dollars ... because we're not doing business with them right now. And they want to make a deal. They want to make a deal very badly.

(With input from agencies)

As Warren Buffett prepares to step down from the helm of Berkshire Hathaway by the end of this year, all eyes are on his chosen successor—Greg Abel. While Abel may not match Buffett’s legendary stature, analysts, board members, and executives across Berkshire’s sprawling empire believe he possesses the values and vision needed to preserve the company’s unique culture and long-term success.Abel, currently Vice Chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, will take over the $1.18 trillion conglomerate, a transition Buffett officially confirmed during the company’s annual shareholder meeting on May 3 in Omaha. Though Buffett, 94, has hinted at succession plans over the years, the formal announcement still came as a surprise to many.""It's working way better with Greg Abel than with me, because I don't want to work as hard as he works,"" Buffett quipped, signalling his confidence in Abel’s commitment and capabilities.Experts and executives across Berkshire’s vast network believe Abel is well-suited for the top job. Though not a household name, he is respected internally for his strategic acumen, integrity, and deep understanding of operations.“Is he another Warren Buffett? No, there is no other Warren Buffett that I know,” said longtime Berkshire board member Ron Olson, two days before the announcement. “But he has so many of the fundamentals of Warren.He is for sure high integrity. He is a hard worker. He is a strategic thinker.”Abel himself praised Buffett during the meeting, saying: “Warren has obviously been a remarkable teacher, and I have benefited from that for years.” Asked about his approach to managing Berkshire’s subsidiaries, Abel responded, “More active,” signalling his intent to be more engaged operationally while still honouring Berkshire’s decentralized culture.That culture—defined by independence, trust, and minimal interference—is something Abel is expected to preserve. It was the late Charlie Munger who previously foreshadowed this leadership transition, famously saying: “Greg will keep the culture.”Executives at a wide range of Berkshire companies—from Brooks Running and Shaw Industries to Borsheims jewelry—have praised Abel’s accessibility and strategic insights.Chris Kelly, CEO of HomeServices of America, the largest US residential real estate brokerage, described Abel as a leader who challenges teams to think deeper. “Abel’s questions ensure you are thinking through directives and plans as a company,” he said. “You come away smarter from having a conversation with him.”Troy Bader, CEO of Dairy Queen, echoed that sentiment. “When I think about Greg, he not only has high business acumen, but he has really high business instincts,” Bader said. “The intuition is really important. And, you know, Warren has that intuition, but Greg has a lot of it as well.”Abel has also earned the trust to take on one of Buffett’s most important responsibilities: capital allocation. Over the past year, he has assumed more control over Berkshire’s investment strategy and, as Buffett confirmed last year, Abel will have the final say on decisions related to the company’s portfolio of public stocks.Born in Edmonton, Alberta, on June 1, 1962, Abel grew up in a working-class household. “It was a real working-class family where sometimes people had jobs and sometimes they didn’t,” he recalled in a 2018 video for the Horatio Alger Association, which honored him that year. “You realized we were all working hard to try to advance our family.”From cleaning discarded bottles to filling fire extinguishers, Abel held odd jobs before graduating from the University of Alberta in 1984. He began his career at PricewaterhouseCoopers and later joined the energy firm CalEnergy. He entered the Berkshire fold in 1992 through MidAmerican Energy, which Berkshire eventually acquired. Abel became its CEO in 2008 and now oversees all of Berkshire’s non-insurance businesses, including BNSF Railway, Berkshire Hathaway Energy, and a variety of industrial and retail operations.Though he has stayed largely out of the media spotlight, Abel has demonstrated his detailed business knowledge at Berkshire shareholder meetings, especially in discussions around utilities and railroads. His leadership style reflects Buffett’s focus on fundamentals—hard work, long-term thinking, and trust in people.“I think hard work leads to good outcomes,” Abel said in 2018. “In my schooling, in sports, and in my business positions, I learned that if I put in a lot of work and was well-prepared, then success would be more likely.”Experts agree that while Buffett’s shoes are impossible to fill, Greg Abel is well-prepared to lead with a steady hand. As the post-Buffett era begins, it’s not about replacing a legend—it’s about preserving a legacy. And according to those who know him, Abel is exactly the kind of leader who can do just that.","Greg Abel, currently Vice Chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, will take over the $1.18 trillion conglomerate.

Warren Buffett, the 94-year-old billionaire investor and the world's fifth's richest person, announced his retirement as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, effective end of 2025. He made this announcement on Saturday at the company's annual shareholders' meeting in Omaha.“Tomorrow, we're having a board meeting of Berkshire, and we have 11 directors. Two of the directors, who are my children, Howie and Susie, know of what I'm going to talk about there. The rest of them, this will come as news to, but I think the time has arrived where Greg should become the chief executive officer of the company at year end,"" said Buffett.Despite Greg Abel being named successor in 2021, the announcement's timing caught many of the thousands of attendees off guard, though the succession itself wasn't entirely unexpected.Although he possesses enormous wealth, Buffett maintains an understated lifestyle. His primary residence remains the same Omaha property purchased in 1958 for $31,500. Currently worth approximately £1.4 million, this home stands in stark contrast to the lavish estates owned by fellow billionaires. Additionally, he maintains a holiday property in Laguna Beach, California.Buffett has pledged to donate the majority of his fortune, primarily to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. His dedication to charitable giving has become as significant as his investment achievements.Also Read | From Apple to Dexter Shoes: Warren Buffett’s top wins and biggest blunders in 60 years of investing After 54 years at Berkshire Hathaway's helm, Buffett's departure marks a significant transition. His journey from a young lad inspired by ""One Thousand Ways to Make $1000"" to leading one of the globe's largest conglomerates has inspired investors throughout the years.Buffett's approach exemplifies careful consideration and restraint. His February letter to shareholders reflected this stance: ""Nothing looks compelling."" Berkshire's cash reserves reached $334 billion by end-2024, with market observers interpreting this substantial holding as strategic preparation for potential market volatility.This methodical investment stance reflects his core principles. ""People who get too upset with price fluctuations … shouldn't own a stock at all,"" he stated to CNBC in 2018. His 2008 New York Times op-ed advised, ""Be fearful when others are greedy, and be greedy when others are fearful.""His commitment to extended investment periods remains unwavering.

The United States is expected to seek significant changes in India’s trade policies, including reductions in tariffs and regulatory reforms, as part of the ongoing bilateral trade negotiations, according to the Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI) as quoted by news agency PTI.In the agriculture sector , GTRI noted that US demands include curbing India’s minimum support price (MSP) programs for staple crops such as rice and wheat, removing import barriers on genetically modified (GM) products, and cutting tariffs on farm goods.The dairy sector is also a key point of contention. The US contends that India’s requirements for GM-free feed certification and facility registration serve as a de facto ban on American dairy imports . Indian regulations currently prohibit imports from animals fed with animal-derived feed, such as butter from cows fed meat, due to cultural and religious considerations.“India considers this policy non-negotiable,” said GTRI Founder Ajay Srivastava.Additionally, the US is likely to push for easing restrictions on American retail giants such as Amazon and Walmart, which face challenges under India's rules against foreign-owned inventory-based e-commerce models.“India resists the easing as it has to protect its small domestic retailers from unfair competition from deep-pocketed foreign firms,” Srivastava noted. “It also views these restrictions as part of preserving regulatory autonomy in a fast-evolving sector.”The US has also raised concerns over India’s complex licensing processes for importing remanufactured and second-hand capital goods, describing them as expensive and time-consuming. These include requirements for technical certification, import quantity limits, and a mandatory guarantee of at least five years of residual product life.“India maintains that differentiating between new and remanufactured products is crucial to prevent dumping of obsolete technologies and to protect local manufacturing,” Srivastava said. He added, “as negotiations proceed, Washington will continue pressing for wide-ranging reforms in tariffs, standards, digital rules, and services access.”","The US is expected to seek significant changes in India’s trade policies, including reductions in tariffs and regulatory reforms.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume.

Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran Udaan until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.Udaan built an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business still accounts for a very small part of India’s overall retail market but can balloon to $150 billion in sales and yield a 100% return on capital invested in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co. estimates published in the Mint newspaper.Bengaluru-based Udaan has also ventured into financing through its fintech unit which helps shopkeepers get working capital loans to buy inventory. That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says.

Space sector start-up Sisir Radar to develop SAR on L/P band SAR,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/space-sector-start-up-sisir-radar-to-develop-sar-on-l/p-band-sar/articleshow/104558111.cms,"CHENNAI: Space sector startup, Sisir Radar Private Ltd has hit success at the prestigious iDEX DefSpace Challenge with its projects for development of “L/P band Continuous Wave SAR (synthetic aperture radar) payload for LEO Small Satellites” and “Unfurlable, Electronically Steering Antenna for L/P band SAR payload” for Indian Air Force (IAF), said a top company official.The company is promoted by former Director at the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) Tapan Misra and the brains behind the Indian space agency’s RISAT series of SAR satellites as well as the Dual Frequency SAR on the Chandrayaan 2 orbiter that is currently circling the moon.""A grant of Rs 3 crore is also there for development of the products,"" Misra told IANS.Synthetic Aperture Radar or SAR is a special kind of imaging radar technology that can provide extremely accurate high resolution imagery of the terrain through clouds, smoke and dust even in pitch dark conditions. SAR imagery provides much higher resolution than other forms of remote sensing technology such as hyperspectral and multispectral. SAR is a critical technology for strategic reconnaissance and planning as well as for disaster management.According to Misra, winning the challenge in just over a year of floating the company is a major booster.He said L and P band SAR have an advantage over other frequencies (like X band) when it comes to penetration capabilities through rain, clouds, foliage and vegetation in a tropical country like India, and underground penetration capabilities in dry terrain.Continuing further, he said the L band SAR will provide 1 metre resolution, spotlight resolution in Stripmap mode. The current industry standard is 5-10 metre in L band. Misra said both the L and P band will operate simultaneously from a satellite borne SAR. Recently, Sisir Radar successfully developed and tested the world’s highest resolution L-Band SAR fitted on a drone. With 0.2 metre resolution, this is by far the highest L band SAR in the world, he said.","Space sector startup, Sisir Radar Private Ltd has hit success at the prestigious iDEX DefSpace Challenge.

Testify: Sam Bankman-Fried acknowledges 'mistakes' but testifies he did not defraud anyone,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/cryptocurrency/sam-bankman-fried-acknowledges-mistakes-but-testifies-he-did-not-defraud-anyone/articleshow/104761929.cms,"<p>Sam Bankman-Fried (File Photo- Reuters)<br></p>

NEW YORK: Sam Bankman-Fried , testifying in his own defense at his fraud trial on Friday, acknowledged that a ""lot of people got hurt"" when the FTX cryptocurrency exchange he founded collapsed, but said he did not defraud anyone or take customer funds.Shortly after taking the witness stand in Manhattan federal court, Bankman-Fried said he made ""a number of small mistakes and a number of larger mistakes"" while running the now-bankrupt exchange. The biggest mistake, he said, was not implementing a dedicated risk management team.""We thought that we might be able to build the best product on the market,"" Bankman-Fried said. ""It turned out basically the opposite of that. A lot of people got hurt - customers, employees - and the company ended up in bankruptcy.""Prosecutors accuse Bankman-Fried of using FTX customer funds to prop up his crypto-focused hedge fund, Alameda Research, make speculative venture investments and donate more than $100 million to US political campaigns. He also faces charges of scheming to cheat Alameda's lenders and FTX investors.He has pleaded not guiltyBankman-Fried's trial, which began on October 3, is drawing to a close nearly a year after FTX collapsed amid a wave of customer withdrawals. The company declared bankruptcy in November 2022 and Bankman-Fried was indicted the following month.His testimony marked the first time the dozen jurors and five alternates have heard directly from the 31-year-old former billionaire after 12 trial days.Bankman-Fried, who was jailed in August after US District Judge Lewis Kaplan found he likely tampered with witnesses, wore a suit and spoke with two water bottles placed in front of him on the witness stand. The former mogul once known for wearing shorts and T-shirts and sporting an unkempt mop of curly locks cut his hair before his trial began.Responding to questions posed by his defense lawyer Mark Cohen, Bankman-Fried spoke in calm, measured tones during the first portion of his testimony as he recounted founding Alameda in 2017, shortly after graduating from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, despite knowing little about crypto.But Bankman-Fried - who had studied physics and worked as a quantitative trader at Jane Street - said he saw opportunities for ""arbitrage"" in the market for digital assets. He said Alameda's first office was in a small Airbnb in Berkeley, California, before he later moved the firm to Hong Kong.""We wanted to be under the radar at that point in time,"" he said on the stand, adding he named the hedge fund after the California county where it was founded in part so competitors would not discover what they were doing.Jurors have heard from three of his closest confidantes at FTX and Alameda, all of whom have pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors. They testified earlier this month that they committed financial crimes at Bankman-Fried's behest.For criminal defendants, taking the stand is a risky proposition because it opens them up to potentially probing cross-examination by prosecutors.But given Bankman-Fried's penchant for risk, legal experts say he likely viewed taking the stand as his best shot to counter the allegations made by members of his inner circle, which were backed up by spreadsheets the three said demonstrated how customer funds were stolen and text messages in which they discussed FTX's shortfall of funds with Bankman-Fried.","Sam Bankman-Fried says he made ""a number of small mistakes and a number of larger mistakes"" while running the now-bankrupt exchange.

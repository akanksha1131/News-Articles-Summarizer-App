(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market and other asset classes given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)

Stock market recommendations:The benchmark Nifty index extended its losing streak for the sixth consecutive week, marking its longest stretch of weekly declines since the COVID-19 market crash in 2020. This persistent weakness reflects the prevailing bearish sentiment in the market. Technically, the index has formed a bearish candle with a long upper shadow for the fourth straight week, indicating that every attempt at a rally is being met with strong selling pressure. This pattern highlights the lack of conviction among bulls and the dominance of bears at higher levels.Market sentiment further deteriorated during the week following geopolitical developments, particularly the imposition of a 25% tariff on Indian goods by U.S. President Donald Trump, escalating trade tensions over India’s Russian oil imports. Additionally, weak Q1 earnings across key sectors and continued FII selling added to the pressure on equities.From a technical standpoint, the Nifty index continues to show pronounced weakness. It is trading below its 20-day, 50-day, and 100-day EMAs, all of which are sloping downward — a clear indication of sustained bearish momentum.The RSI on the daily chart has entered a super bearish zone, as per RSI range shift principles, further confirming the negative bias. The MACD indicator also remains in bearish territory, with the MACD line positioned below both its signal line and the zero line, reinforcing the ongoing downtrend and suggesting that selling pressure continues to dominate.In terms of key levels, the zone of 24,200–24,150 is expected to act as crucial support, as it represents the confluence of the 200-day EMA and the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level of the prior rally from 21,743 to 25,669. A breach below 24,150 could lead to further downside towards 23,750. On the upside, the 100-day EMA zone of 24,570–24,600 will serve as a significant resistance level, where selling pressure is likely to re-emerge.Bank Nifty concluded the week in negative territory, signalling ongoing weakness in the financial sector. On the weekly chart, the index formed a bearish candle, underscoring sustained selling pressure. Over the past two sessions, it has been consolidating near its 100-day EMA.Looking ahead, the 100-day EMA zone of 54,950–54,850 will serve as a crucial support level. A decisive break below 54,850 could accelerate the downward momentum, potentially dragging the index toward the next support range of 54,000–53,900. On the upside, any rebound is likely to encounter resistance around 55,700–55,800, which now stands as a significant barrier for bullish attempts.The stock of Kajaria Ceramics Ltd has been consistently outperforming frontline indices over the past few trading sessions. On Friday, it registered a breakout above a horizontal trendline on the daily chart, supported by robust volume — a key confirmation of bullish intent. Technically, the stock is trading above all major moving averages, and momentum indicators are aligned positively, reinforcing the strength of the ongoing uptrend.Given this setup, we recommend accumulating the stock in the 1310–1300 range, with a stoploss at 1250. On the upside, the stock has the potential to test 1410 in the near term.The stock recently found support near its 100-day EMA and has since witnessed a sharp upward move, outperforming frontline indices. Currently, it is consolidating in a narrow range, forming a solid base around its 20-day EMA — a sign of strength and stability.It continues to trade above key moving averages, and technical indicators point to sustained bullish momentum. Given this setup, we recommend accumulating the stock in the 1970–1950 zone, with a stoploss at 1880. On the upside, the stock has the potential to test 2150 in the short term.","According to Sudeep Shah, Head - Technical Research and Derivatives, SBI Securities, Kajaria Ceramics Ltd, and Affle 3i Ltd are the top stock picks for this week.

How the redemption price is calculated

What you need to do now

Check your SGB tranche and issue date to confirm eligibility.

Submit your redemption request before the deadline mentioned in the RBI schedule.

Remember: the bonds are also tradable, transferable and can be pledged as collateral.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has announced that investors in Sovereign Gold Bonds (SGB) 2019-20 Series-IX and 2020-21 Series-V can opt for premature redemption on August 11, 2025, at Rs 10,070 per unit.These government-backed bonds, with an eight-year tenure, allow early redemption only after the fifth year from the date of issue and exclusively on interest payout dates, according to an ET report. The most recent SGB tranche—SGB 2023-24 Series IV—was issued in February 2024.If you invested in the SGB 2019-20 Series-IX in September 2019 at Rs 4,070 per gram, your premature redemption will yield an absolute gain of Rs 6,000 per unit—about 147%—excluding the 2.5% annual interest. Investors in the SGB 2020-21 Series-V, issued in August 2020 at Rs 5,334 per gram, will earn an 89% absolute return, or Rs 4,736 per unit, excluding interest.On top of these capital gains, the bonds pay a fixed 2.5% interest annually, credited semi-annually to your bank account. The final interest instalment is paid along with principal on maturity.According to the RBI’s August 8 press release, the price is based on the simple average of closing gold prices (999 purity) over the three business days before redemption—August 6, 7 and 8—published by the India Bullion and Jewellers Association Ltd (IBJA).The SGB scheme offers a safe alternative to physical gold, removing storage and purity concerns while delivering steady interest income and potential price appreciation","Sovereign Gold Bonds (SGB) 2019-20 Series-IX and 2020-21 Series-V can opt for premature redemption on August 11, 2025, at Rs 10,070 per unit.

Jefferies has put a buy recommendation on Titan with the target price at Rs 3,800. Analysts said during the April-June quarter (Q1) the company demonstrated strong growth across brands under jewellery as well as watches, along with margin expansion. Part of the margin gain was bolstered by one off but adjusted for the same its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) was also ahead of estimates.Goldman Sachs has a buy rating on Page Industries with the target price at Rs 50,000. Analysts said during Q1, the company’s profit after tax (PAT) was well ahead of estimates, led by gross margin expansion. Its normalized volume growth was likely in mid-single digits, but is expected to gradually recover. They said that the competitive intensity in the industry is structurally lower, and the company is likely to benefit as macros recover.Morgan Stanley maintained its overweight rating on AU Small Finance Bank with the target price at Rs 860. Analysts said the RBI granted in-principle approval to the lender for universal banking license, which is a big positive. This would allow AU Bank to improve its brand visibility, and further boost liability franchise, and help sustain strong growth.The license allows the lender to expand its product suite, customer base, and geographic reach.Motilal Oswal Securities maintained its neutral rating on Sun TV Network with the target price cut to Rs 600 from Rs 625 earlier. Analysts said the company showed a weak start to FY26 and going forward recovery in advertisement revenue remains the key monitorable. They cut Sun TV’s FY26–27 EBITDA by 3-4% due to weakness in advertisement revenue and elevated operational expense. They cut Sun TV’s FY26-27 PAT by 5-8%.Nomura maintained its buy rating on Cummins India with the target price at Rs 3,800. Analysts said the company’s Q1 numbers were strong as those beat on all fronts. Its revenue jumped 26% on an annual basis which was led by robust performances in both domestic sales and exports. The company also showed a 17% beat on EBITDA estimate which was due to improved operating leverage. They said the management remained cautiously optimistic in the near term.","Jefferies has put a buy recommendation on Titan with the target price at Rs 3,800.

What happens if the trade talks with the US don't yield results?

Bharat Forge has a large US exposure and is in talks with American buyers after import duties were slapped on Indian exports. While it is hopeful of the issue getting resolved, it will eye opportunities in Europe if there is no resolution, the company's vice-chairman and joint MD Amit Kalyani tells TOI. Excerpts:The US auto sector accounts for about 35-40% of our sales. Over the years, because of our defence businesses and other businesses in the EU, we have reduced our share of the US and reduced the risk, but it still remains a very important market. We have very strong and entrenched relations with our customers in the US as we have been supplying them for 30 years. We need to work with the customers on how we navigate this challenge. Everyone understands the push & pull and we will work jointly with customers.In the near term, there will be some demand issues due to the overhang of tariffs but we don't know if it will exacerbate or get resolved; no one knows the impact on profit and demand. When it comes to Indian exports to the US, the larger sectors in the non-IT and non-pharma space, such as textiles and garments, shoes, gems & jewellery-which are extremely fragmented-and large employers will have bigger and faster impact.These are also sectors which are very price sensitive.The challenge can also be a growth opportunity. After all, India has the ambition to grow and create opportunities for the 1.4 billion citizens of the country. We need to accelerate the pace of employment in the long run. There is a risk in the short to medium term.But India and the US are not enemies and issues should get resolved, otherwise India has to look at other opportunities, which may take time. The greatest opportunity would be to look at building infrastructure at a faster pace and speed up large capital expenditure, which will also create jobs and make India more competitive.As a business, we always deal with issues that are within our control and as a country too we need to do that.The first quarter has been weak and the second quarter will be similar. It will also depend on the impact (of tariffs) and how things play out over the next 10-15 days. We expect the second half to be better.There are a lot of opportunities in Europe... FTAs are a good starting point for engagement.","Bharat Forge has a large US exposure and is in talks with American buyers after import duties were slapped on Indian exports.

How do you combat this?

What should govt do to help the industry?

Gokaldas Exports is among the largest players in the garments business, supplying goods to top global markets. The company's managing director Siva Ganapathi speaks to TOI over the impact and plans to tackle the 50% tariff imposed by the US on Indian goods. Excerpts:Let's first understand the impact of the 20% tariff. Ultimately, the garment price has to increase and the customer has to pay. At the moment, there is a reluctance to increase prices for consumers, and buyers had asked us to absorb a portion of the initially imposed 10% tariff, which was shared with the entire supply chain, including those selling fabrics and spinners and the others. But 20% is too high to be absorbed by the supply chain. What this is going to do is force brands to consider pricing (-in the increase in tariff) and de-specing, something like shrinkflation, which means reducing some features to maintain the price with fewer features. For all practical purposes, 20% (tariff) is the new zero. There would be scope to increase some prices by next year.A 25% tariff on Indian goods can be managed and we can absorb it through some improvisation, although it is not desirable.But 50% is not a tariff, it is an embargo. We will lose business.Business will pivot to some other countries, we will try to move to some European markets, reduce capacity. That's the only way to counter it. It will require tremendous effort to find a solution to offset a 30% relative disadvantage (given 50% tariff on India). There has to be some give and take between India and the US. We hope that a rational outcome is found in the next two-three months and it comes close to 20%. If a solution is not found, the industry will be badly hit.India exports around $5 billion (worth of garments) to the US and it will not be easy for American buyers to overnight find this capacity in some other country.It should speed up the FTA with the European Union, make sure that the UK agreement is implemented faster and clinch a deal with the US.In the interim, there should be some incentives for exports to the US to partly defray the costs, support the manpower in the sector and ensure their livelihood. After all, China does this to insulate its industry. The point is how do you stay in the game till a solution (with the US) is found. There can be some procedural changes which are pending for long, that will help reduce costs.",Gokaldas Exports is among the largest players in the garments business.

Of the Rs 3.6-lakh-crore increase in its loan book over the year, nearly a third - Rs 1.1 lakh crore - came from home loans.Meanwhile, HDFC Bank's outstanding home loans increased 7% to Rs 8.4 lakh crore in June 2025 from Rs 7.9 lakh crore in June 2024. The private lender's home loan growth has been sluggish, which the bank attributed to intense price competition.In Q1, SBI's mortgage book growth was around Rs 20,000 crore, rising from an outstanding base of Rs 8.3 lakh crore as of March 2025. SBI's loan additions during the first quarter were nearly 35% of the total of Rs 56,643 crore in home loans added by banks during the first quarter, RBI data showed.In the earnings call, SBI chairman C S Setty said that SBI's incremental loan market share gains were ""led primarily by high return on risk-weighted asset segments such as retail mortgages and secured small business credit"", indicating that home loans were a key driver of the bank's credit growth in the quarter. The push for housing has come against a backdrop of slower corporate credit growth, which Setty attributed to around Rs 12,000 crore of prepayments as borrowers refinanced at lower rates in a declining interest rate cycle, the shift of Rs 16,000-18,000 crore of borrowing by large corporates to the more competitive commercial paper market, and SBI's decision not to match very low rates in some cases to preserve risk-adjusted pricing, noting that such trends are a recurring feature when interest rates fall.According to Setty, home loans have been the main driver for retail credit as well. ""Home loans we have done 15% ... that's a phenomenal growth. But I definitely visualise that the unsecured personal loan segment and auto loan segment is not doing all that well in terms of sales.

US stocks closed with mixed results as the impact of President Donald Trump's tariffs, which affected numerous countries, was relatively subdued in global markets. The S&P 500 dipped by 0.1% after nearing its all-time high earlier in the day. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 224 points, or 0.5%, and the Nasdaq Composite increased by 0.3%, reaching a new record.The S&P 500 experienced a slight decline of 0.1% after momentarily nearing its all-time high earlier in the day. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 224 points, or 0.5%, while the Nasdaq composite saw a 0.3% increase, reaching a new record.Concerns are mounting that President Trump's tariffs are negatively impacting the economy, especially following last week's disappointing job market report. However, optimism surrounding potential interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve and a series of unexpectedly strong profit reports from major U.S. companies are helping to alleviate some of these worries, at least temporarily. Lower interest rates can stimulate the economy and boost investment prices, although they also carry the risk of increasing inflation. In a similar move, the Bank of England reduced its main interest rate on Thursday in an effort to support the struggling U.K.economy.The S&P 500 rose 0.5% in early trading, hovering just below its all-time high set last month while Dow gained 200 points and Nasdaq climbed 1%.However, the market eventually plunged into red as DJIA was dipped 355 points or 0.8%, trading at 43,837. Nasdaq followed the suit, falling to 21,157, shredding 0.06% or 12 points.Trump's new tariffs, which took effect Thursday morning, are seen as part of an ongoing trade push that has rattled markets and policymakers globally. Some nations are still in talks to reduce the tax rates on their exports, but for now, uncertainty remains the only constant on Wall Street.On Thursday, the Bank of England cut its main interest rate in an effort to support the struggling UK economy.The latest round of US tariffs, which came into effect on Thursday morning, were already expected and turned out to be lower than Trump had initially warned. Several countries are still trying to negotiate lower tax rates on their exports, while uncertainty continues to loom large on Wall Street.The latest reports on the US economy painted a mixed picture, keeping Treasury yields largely steady in the bond market.One report showed a slight rise in the number of Americans applying for unemployment benefits last week. While this may hint at an increase in layoffs, the figure still falls within its usual range.","The S&P 500 experienced a slight decline of 0.1% after momentarily nearing its all-time high earlier in the day.

FICCI president Harsha Vardhan Agarwal on Thursday called for urgent and bold economic reforms to strengthen India’s industrial base and services sector, In response to the US imposing an additional 25% import tariff on Indian goods.The latest move from Washington takes the total tariff burden on Indian imports to 50%, sparking concerns across domestic export-facing industries. The fresh duty, aimed at penalising India over its continued purchase of Russian oil, will take effect 21 days from the order.The first tranche of tariffs kicked in on August 7. Goods already in transit or those falling under specific exemptions will be spared.Describing the moment as an opportunity to double down on India’s economic potential, Agarwal said in a post on FICCI’s official X handle:""India has in the past faced multiple challenges and we have through our collective resolve turned adversity into opportunity. It is time that we once again focus all our energies into further strengthening our industrial economy and the services sectors.

Shares of Intel tumbled down on Thursday after US President Donald Trump called for the company’s chief executive to resign, citing alleged conflicts of interest involving ties to China.The INTC was trading at $19.77, down 0.6 points or 3.1% at 10:53 PM IST.“The CEO of Intel is highly CONFLICTED and must resign, immediately,” Trump wrote on his social media platform, Truth Social.“There is no other solution to this problem. Thank you for your attention to this problem!” he further added.Trump’s remarks came shortly after senator Tom Cotton sent a letter to Intel chairman Frank Yeary, raising concerns over CEO Lip-Bu Tan’s business connections.The letter questioned whether Tan had divested his interests in various semiconductor firms that reportedly have links to the Chinese Communist Party and China’s military.“In March 2025, Intel appointed Lip-Bu Tan as its new CEO,” Cotton wrote in the letter.“Mr Tan reportedly controls dozens of Chinese companies and has a stake in hundreds of Chinese advanced-manufacturing and chip firms. At least eight of these companies reportedly have ties to the Chinese People’s Liberation Army.”The senator specifically highlighted Tan’s recent leadership at Cadence Design Systems, a tech company that had earlier admitted to selling products to China’s National University of Defense Technology in violation of US export rules.“US companies who receive government grants should be responsible stewards of taxpayer dollars and adhere to strict security regulations,” Cotton posted on X.Intel is among the major beneficiaries of President Joe Biden’s CHIPS Act, having secured over $8 billion in federal funding to support the construction of chip plants across the United States.The company has yet to issue a response to either Trump’s post or Cotton’s letter.Following the controversy, Intel’s stock fell by 3%, even as broader markets, including the tech-heavy Nasdaq, moved higher.Founded in 1968 during the early days of the personal computing era, Intel has struggled in recent years. It failed to keep pace with the mobile revolution sparked by Apple’s iPhone in 2007 and has since fallen behind more agile competitors. The rise of artificial intelligence has only widened that gap, with Nvidia emerging as a dominant force in the chipmaking industry.Now under Tan’s leadership since March, Intel is undergoing major restructuring. The company is cutting thousands of jobs, slashing expenses, and even scaling back some domestic semiconductor manufacturing, all in an effort to turn around its declining fortunes.","US President Donald Trump called for the company’s chief executive to resign, citing alleged conflicts of interest involving ties to China.

A sia’s richest man Mukesh Ambani has once again chosen to draw no salary from Reliance Industries, the oil-to-telecom-to-retail giant he heads, for the fifth consecutive year. Instead, dividend payouts remain his primary source of income, according to a PTI report.According to the latest annual report of Reliance Industries, Ambani, 68, received 'nil' salary, allowances, perquisites, and retiral benefits for the financial year 2024-25 (FY25).Ambani had capped his annual remuneration at Rs 15 crore between from financial year 2009 to 2020.Since FY21, he voluntarily opted to forego his salary due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and has continued to do so each year since.Despite not drawing a salary, Ambani, who is currently the 18th richest person in the world with a net worth just under $100 billion, earned Rs 8.85 crore in dividend income from the 1.61 crore shares he directly holds in Reliance. This is based on the Rs 5.50 per share dividend declared by the company for FY25, as reported by PTI.In addition, promoter group firms under Ambani’s control hold 664.5 crore shares, amounting to a 50.07% stake in the company bringing in a combined dividend income of Rs 3,655 crore.The annual report also shed light on the remuneration of other top executives and family members. Ambani’s cousins, Nikhil and Hital Meswani, saw a slight dip in their pay to Rs 25 crore each in FY25, compared to Rs 25.31 crore and Rs 25.42 crore, respectively, in FY24. Their earnings included a commission of Rs 17.28 crore each, unchanged from the past three years, the PTI report said.Executive Director P M S Prasad’s remuneration rose to Rs 19.96 crore in FY25 from Rs 17.93 crore in the previous year. His pay includes performance-linked incentives for FY24, which were disbursed in FY25.Ambani’s three children, Isha, Akash, and Anant, who joined the Reliance board in October 2023 at nil salary, received Rs 6 lakh each as sitting fee and Rs 2.27 lakh each as commission, the PTI report said. In the previous financial year, they had received Rs 4 lakh in sitting fees and Rs 97 lakh in commission.The youngest, Anant Ambani, has since been appointed as an Executive Director on the Reliance board. From this fiscal year, he is expected to earn between Rs 10 crore and Rs 20 crore in salary, the report said.Other notable non-executive directors on the Reliance board include Raminder Singh Gujral, Shumeet Banerji, former SBI chairperson Arundhati Bhattacharya, former CVC K V Chowdary, veteran banker K V Kamath, and Saudi sovereign wealth fund nominee Yasir Othman H Al Rumayyan. All independent directors received a commission of Rs 2.25 crore each, along with a sitting fee, unchanged from the previous year.","Mukesh Ambani is the 18th richest person in the world with a net worth just under $100 billion.

, Fed rate cuts and tariff risks

Tariffs at century-high average levels

A fresh look at US inflation trends this week is set to test Wall Street’s record run, with several strategists warning that equities may be primed for a pullback after months of near-uninterrupted gains.The benchmark S&P 500 closed on Friday up more than 8% for the year and near all-time highs, while the Nasdaq Composite set a new record, rebounding from early August losses triggered by weak US jobs data, according to Reuters report.The rally has lifted the S&P 500 by 28% from its April low, calming fears of a tariff-driven recession that had spiked after President Donald Trump’s “Liberation Day” announcement earlier this year.Strategists at Deutsche Bank and Morgan Stanley have cautioned that the market’s steep climb has pushed valuations to historically expensive levels as the seasonally weak August–September period begins. “I do think the market is set up for a bit of a pullback. There’s a lot of concern bubbling underneath,” said Dominic Pappalardo, chief multi-asset strategist at Morningstar Wealth.The July consumer price index (CPI), due Tuesday, is forecast to have risen 2.8% year-on-year, according to a Reuters poll.Analysts say stronger-than-expected inflation could temper expectations of imminent interest rate cuts, even as futures markets price in a 90% chance of a September Fed cut and at least two cuts this year.Morgan Stanley’s Michael Wilson warned that “a softer payroll number with concerns of tariff-related inflation could be the recipe for … a correction, especially in the seasonally weak third quarter,” though he maintained a bullish 12-month outlook, saying “we’re buyers of pullbacks.”Trump’s new import levies took effect on Thursday, raising the average US import duty to its highest in a century. Additional tariffs on semiconductor chips and pharmaceutical imports have been announced, while China could face higher duties on Tuesday unless a truce is extended.“The market has kind of ignored the potential negative impact of this friction to the economy,” said Matt Rowe, senior portfolio manager at Man Group. “The market has gotten comfortable with tariffs being kind of a non-event, which I don’t think is correct.”","S&P 500 closed on Friday up more than 8% for the year and near all-time highs.

‘Failed to show respect’: Adidas designer Willy Chavarria regrets ‘Oaxaca slip-on’; accused of copying Mexican design,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/failed-to-show-respect-adidas-designer-willy-chavarria-regrets-oaxaca-slip-on-accused-of-copying-mexican-design/articleshow/123217073.cms,"Willy Chavarria (L); Sandals known as ""huaraches"" displayed at a market in Oaxaca (R)

US fashion designer Willy Chavarria has said he regrets that sandals he made with Adidas copied a traditional design from Oaxaca in southern Mexico.""I deeply regret that this design has appropriated the name and was not developed in direct and meaningful partnership with the Oaxacan community,"" Chavarria told AFP.Chavarria further admitted the sandals failed to show the respect and cooperation owed to the community of Villa Hidalgo Yalalag, where the original design is believed to have originated. Chavarria is of Mexican heritage.Authorities in Oaxaca, Mexico, had complained that the “Oaxaca slip-on” sandals were a reworked version of the huarache, a style made only in that region, which has one of Mexico’s largest indigenous populations.On Friday, Mexico’s government said it would seek compensation from Adidas, after which Mexico’s president Claudia Sheinbaum said Adidas had agreed to meet Oaxaca officials. She said the design was “collective intellectual property” and that the heritage law must be followed.The shoe features thin braided leather straps in a style tied to the cultural heritage of Zapotec Indigenous communities in Oaxaca, particularly in Villa Hidalgo de Yalalag.While traditional huaraches use flat leather soles, Adidas’ version incorporates a chunky sports shoe sole.The case is the latest in which Mexico has accused big fashion brands of using indigenous designs without permission. Similar disputes have involved Shein, Zara and Carolina Herrera. Handicrafts are a major source of jobs in Mexico, especially in Oaxaca, Jalisco, Michoacán and Guerrero.Last month in India, a public interest case was filed in the Bombay High Court against Italian brand Prada for showing sandals at Milan Fashion Week that looked similar to the traditional Kolhapuri chappal.","US fashion designer Willy Chavarria has said he regrets that sandals he made with Adidas copied a traditional design from Oaxaca in southern Mexico.

Michigan Governor Whitmer urges Donald Trump to ease tariffs; auto jobs under threat; automaker fears rising cost,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/michigan-governor-whitmer-urges-trump-to-ease-tariffs-auto-jobs-under-threat-automaker-fears-rising-cost/articleshow/123208635.cms,"‘India Fell Into U.S. Trap’: Top Economist Jeffrey Sachs ‘EXPOSES’ Trump’s Tariff Game | Watch

Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer met privately with President Donald Trump this week to deliver a message she knew he might resist: his tariffs are hurting the state’s automotive industry, threatening jobs and profits in a sector central to Michigan’s economy.The Democrat brought a slide presentation to the Oval Office meeting on Tuesday, highlighting how Trump’s import taxes could cause severe economic damage in a state that helped elect him in 2024. It was Whitmer’s third White House meeting since Trump returned to office in January, but unlike her more public visit in April, this one was behind closed doors.According to people familiar with the talks, Whitmer also raised the need for federal support after an ice storm and asked to delay Medicaid changes, reported AP. Trump made no specific commitments.Under Trump’s trade measures, US automakers face a 50% tariff on steel and aluminum, 30% on parts from China, and up to 25% on goods from Canada and Mexico not covered by a 2020 trade deal. Meanwhile, German, Japanese and South Korean vehicles pay only a 15% import tax under new agreements. Trump has also threatened a 100% tariff on imported computer chips, key to modern vehicle production, exempting only domestic producers.Whitmer’s presentation, obtained by The Associated Press, showed that trade with Canada and Mexico has driven $23.2 billion in investment to Michigan since 2020. General Motors, Ford and Stellantis run 50 factories in the state, supported by over 4,000 parts suppliers, together employing nearly 600,000 workers.Automakers have repeatedly warned the administration that the tariffs will cut profits and hurt global competitiveness. Ford said tariffs cost it $800 million in the second quarter alone, while GM reported $1.1 billion in related expenses. Both say these costs could limit investment in new US factories.Since Trump took office in January, Michigan has lost 7,500 manufacturing jobs, federal data show. Smaller suppliers, such as Detroit Axle, have also felt the strain. Owner Mike Musheinesh said the market has shifted from growth to mere survival, though his company recently avoided closing a warehouse and laying off over 100 workers.Matt Grossman, a political science professor at Michigan State University, said the meeting underscored Whitmer’s unique position among Democratic governors, balancing state interests with political opposition to Trump’s agenda. “Everyone’s aware Michigan is a critical swing state and the auto industry has outsized influence,” he said.","Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer met privately with President Donald Trump this week to deliver a message she knew he might resist.

Impact already being felt

Tariffs linked to Bolsonaro case

Flavour explosion

When US President Donald Trump imposed tariffs of 50 per cent on Brazilian exports in July, acai producer Ailson Ferreira Moreira felt immediately concerned.After all, who was going to eat all of that Amazon berry, globally famous as a delicious, refreshing and nutritious superfood, if American consumers suddenly could no longer afford it?As the main importer of the Brazilian berry, prices of acai smoothies and bowls look certain to go up in the United States.""The acai that's all produced here ... If only people here eat it, it's going to be a lot of acai, right?"" Moreira told The Associated Press outside of Belem, an Amazon city of 1.4 million residents that will host this year's UN climate summit COP30 climate summit in November. ""If there's too much acai here, people won't be able to eat it all and the price will drop.""A single full crate of acai sells for around USD 50 at local markets in Brazil, a price that is now expected to plummet. The US is by far the largest acai importer of a total Brazilian output currently estimated at about 70,000 tons per year.The most vulnerable acai producers in the northern state of Para say they have already been hit by tariffs imposed by the US government, as a surplus of the berry without a clear destination starts to mount only days after the new economic scenario unfolded.More powerful exporters, such as Sao Paulo-state based company Acai Tropicalia Mix, are also feeling the impact.One of its owners, Rogerio de Carvalho, told the AP that last year he exported to the US about 270 tonnes of acai cream - an industrialised version of the berry - ready for consumption. As tariffs started to loom, he said, American importers steered away and clients suspended negotiations. Until the end of July, de Carvalho estimates that his company sold 27 tonnes to the US.""That's 1.5 million Brazilian reais (USD 280,000) that we lost,"" the businessman said. ""We are confident there will be a deal between the two countries to allow not only our clients to return, but also getting some new ones.""Trump has linked the higher tariffs on Brazil to the trial of former President Jair Bolsonaro, who is now under house arrest for his alleged role in leading an alleged coup plot to remain in office, despite his election loss to current leftist President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.And despite several Brazilian exports being exempted from the tariffs, acai berries aren't among them.Brazil's industry ministry didn't reply to a request for comment on whether acai berries are among the items that remain on the negotiating table with US trade representatives.Nearly all of the acai consumed in the US originates from Brazil, with the state of Para alone accounting for 90 per cent of the country's total production. Several communities in the Amazon depend on its harvest.The harvesting of acai is a physically demanding job that requires workers to climb tall trees with minimal safety equipment, and then sliding down branches full of berries to fill baskets and then place them carefully in crates.Analysts say its producers also help protect the rainforest from illegal loggers, miners and cattle ranchers.The night markets of Belem, such as the Ver-o-Peso acai market, are a hub of activity where the freshly harvested berries are brought in by boat and prepared for sale.The Brazilian Association of Fruit and Derivative Producers and Exporters estimates there was an explosive growth of acai exports from Para state, from less than one tonne in 1999 to more than 61,000 tons in 2023. Another explosive rise was expected for this year, before the tariffs.On Thursday, Brazil requested consultations at the World Trade Organisation over tariffs imposed by the Trump administration against the South American nation that went into effect on Wednesday.That could be took little too late for acai harvester Mikael Silva Trindade, who agrees that the future of the trade is at risk as higher US tariffs can disrupt the delicate balance of supply and demand that holds the industry.""There will be nowhere to market (the excess of acai),"" Trindade told the AP as he picked berries in Para state. ""The more you export, the more valuable it becomes. But if there's too much to sell, it will stay here and become cheap.""","US President Donald Trump imposed tariffs of 50 per cent on Brazilian exports in July.

Nvidia gets green light: US clears chip exports to China; company avoids billion dollars hit after CEO's meeting with Trump,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/nvidia-gets-green-light-us-clears-chip-exports-to-china-eases-billion-dollars-hit-after-ceos-meeting-with-trump/articleshow/123200512.cms,"The United States Commerce Department has begun issuing licenses to Nvidia to export its H20 chips to China, a US official told Reuters on Friday, marking a major breakthrough for the AI giant's access to one of its most important markets.The move follows Washington’s decision last month to reverse an April ban on sales of the H20 chip to China.Nvidia had designed the processor specifically to comply with Biden-era AI chip export rules. The restrictions were expected to wipe $8 billion off its July-quarter sales, the company had warned.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang met with US President Donald Trump on Wednesday, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.In July, the company said it was applying for licenses to resume H20 sales and had been assured of speedy approvals. It remains unclear how many licenses have been granted, which Chinese companies can receive the chips, or the total value of approved shipments.Nvidia previously disclosed a $5.5 billion hit from the export curbs but later revised the figure down by $1 billion after reusing some materials.The H20 alone generated $4.6 billion in first-quarter sales, with China accounting for 12.5% of the company’s overall revenue.The company has denied Chinese claims that the H20 poses national security risks, insisting the chip contains no “backdoors” for remote access.“Cybersecurity is critically important to us. NVIDIA does not have ‘backdoors’ in our chips that would give anyone a remote way to access or control them,” a Nvidia spokesperson earlier said in a statement.CNBC reported that China’s Cyberspace Administration (CAC) has asked Nvidia to “to clarify and submit relevant supporting documentation regarding security risks, including potential vulnerabilities and backdoors, associated with its H20 computing chips sold to China.”The regulator said Nvidia's AI chips have been reported to contain serious security flaws and noted that some US lawmakers are pushing for mandatory tracking features on advanced chip exports.Other high-end Nvidia AI chips remain barred from sale to China under longstanding US export controls aimed at slowing Beijing's AI and defense advancements.Huang has warned that Nvidia’s industry leadership could be at risk without access to the Chinese market, where domestic rivals like Huawei are rapidly expanding their chip offerings.","US Commerce Department has begun issuing licenses to Nvidia to export its H20 chips to China, a US official told Reuters.

The sharp rise follows fresh duties that took effect Thursday, as part of President Donald Trump's continued push for “reciprocal” trade terms.At the time of Trump’s inauguration in January 2025, the US average tariff rate stood at just 2.4%. But a series of aggressive increases — especially targeting Chinese goods — has rapidly rolled back decades of trade liberalisation, AFP reported.Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump, who has spearheaded the aggressive tariff push since returning to office, took to Truth Social to defend the measures amid concerns that courts may move to block them.“Tariffs are having a huge positive impact on the Stock Market. Almost every day, new records are set. In addition, Hundreds of Billions of Dollars are pouring into our Country’s coffers,” Trump wrote.“If a Radical Left Court ruled against us at this late date, in an attempt to bring down or disturb the largest amount of money, wealth creation and influence the U.S.A. has ever seen, it would be impossible to ever recover, or pay back, these massive sums of money and honor,” he added.Trump further warned that a judicial reversal could provoke economic collapse “It would be 1929 all over again, a GREAT DEPRESSION! If they were going to rule against the wealth, strength, and power of America, they should have done so LONG AGO, at the beginning of the case, where our entire Country, while never having a chance at this kind of GREATNESS again, would not have been put in 1929 style jeopardy.”A brief spike in May had pushed the average to 24.8%, the highest since 1904, based on data from the United States International Trade Commission (USITC). That level temporarily dropped after a short-lived “truce” with China, but tariff escalations have since resumed.The latest WTO-IMF figure applies current US tariffs to 2024 trade volumes, factoring in recent agreements with key trading partners such as the EU, Japan, and South Korea. While those deals slightly softened the hikes threatened in April, they still locked in rates well above the previous norm — exceeding even the 1930s Smoot-Hawley era, when protectionism deepened the Great Depression.Trump’s April 2 declaration of sweeping “reciprocal” tariffs — aimed at narrowing America’s trade deficit — has led to retaliatory measures from several nations, further straining the global trade environment.The temporary China–US truce that reduced tariff levels is set to expire next week, raising the prospect of renewed escalation.","The average US tariff rate has climbed to 20.1%, its highest sustained level since the 1910s, according to new estimates.

Former Singapore foreign minister George Yeo has delivered a sharp rebuke of US President Donald Trump ’s trade policies, warning that his sweeping tariffs signal a decisive break from decades of free trade and could unleash severe disruption across global supply chains.Speaking to First Voice, as reported by The Raisina Hills, Yeo said Trump was “going back to an old world” where there was “no WTO, no MFN,” and trade became an instrument of political leverage.“I like you, I need you more, so we have one regime. I don’t like you, you need me more, we have another regime,” he said, describing Trump’s trade strategy.Yeo argued that this shift reflects a decline in US confidence compared to the era when it commanded 40% of the global economy and set the rules under the World Trade Organisation “The US no longer feels the same self-confidence… it feels a growing insecurity about itself,” he added.He likened the unpredictability of Trump’s trade moves to a ship carrying 20,000 containers mid-voyage that suddenly faces new US rules. “What do you do? If you are receiving those containers, maybe you don’t want them. Or maybe you want the ship to speed up so it arrives before the new policies are in place,” Yeo said, warning that Trump “doesn’t understand that you can change your mind from day to day, but it’s a long tail” for trade flows.Despite his concerns, Yeo said trade “is like water — it will always find its way” regardless of the rules imposed.His remarks come as Trump’s sweeping “reciprocal” tariffs took effect just after midnight on Thursday, hitting exports from more than 60 countries and the European Union with higher import duties.

Stay informed with the latest business news, updates on bank holidays and public holidays.



A sweeping executive order signed by US President Donald Trump on Thursday has paved the way for 401(k) accounts to include private equity, cryptocurrency , and other alternative assets as retirement saving option.A 401(k) is a tax-advantaged retirement savings plan where employees can defer part of their salary, often with employer contributions, and invest the funds for growth, with taxes generally paid upon withdrawal in retirement.The order directs the Labor Department and other federal agencies to revise the definition of “qualified assets” under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), which governs retirement plans. Once implemented, employers could offer workers a broader menu of investment choices, including private equity funds, bitcoin, and real estate. The rulemaking process could take several months.Currently, most 401(k) portfolios are concentrated in stocks, bonds, cash, and widely traded commodities like gold. Alternative assets have been largely off-limits due to concerns over volatility, high fees, and limited liquidity.The change is a win for the $5 trillion private equity sector and the cryptocurrency industry- both of which backed Trump’s 2024 campaign and have long sought ERISA access. Blackstone CEO Steve Schwarzman has repeatedly called for private equity inclusion in retirement plans, while Coinbase has lobbied for broader public adoption of crypto.Bitcoin prices rose two per cent to $116,542 on Thursday, nearly doubling since Trump’s election, as reported by AP. Crypto executives argue the asset offers long-term upside, particularly for younger, tech-savvy workers. “It was inevitable that bitcoin would make its way into American 401(k)s,” said Cory Klippsten, CEO of Swan Bitcoin.Private equity has averaged 13 per cent annual returns since 1990, compared to 10.6 per cent for the S&P 500, including dividends, according to Cambridge Associates. However, such investments typically require long-term commitments and carry higher costs.Also read: Donald Trump's Genius Act- Major crypto bill for stablecoins passed in US; here is what to know Industry groups welcomed Trump’s move but urged caution. “We look forward to working with the Trump Administration on a thoughtful framework that expands access to alternatives for retirement savers with appropriate investor guardrails,” said Bryan Corbett, CEO of the Managed Funds Association.Major retirement providers like Fidelity, Vanguard, and T. Rowe Price will need to develop suitable products, and adoption could take years. Vanguard, in a statement, said it is committed to educating retirement investors on the risks and opportunities of private assets but has not yet pledged to launch such a product.The Biden administration had previously advised treating crypto investments with “extreme care” given their volatility. Trump’s move marks a sharp policy shift — one that could channel billions in retirement savings into high-growth, high-risk markets.","A sweeping executive order signed by US President Donald Trump on Thursday has paved the way for 401(k) accounts to include private equity, cryptocurrency, and other alternative assets.

US president Donald Trump announced on Thursday that he will nominate top economic adviser Stephen Miran to temporarily fill a vacancy on the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors.Miran, who currently chairs the White House’s Council of Economic Advisers, is set to replace outgoing governor Adriana Kugler, a Biden appointee stepping down on Friday. If confirmed by the senate, Miran will serve through January 31, 2026, reports AP.“It is my Great Honor to announce that I have chosen Dr. Stephen Miran, current Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors, to serve in the just vacated seat on the Federal Reserve Board until January 31, 2026.

He has been with me from the beginning of my Second Term, and his expertise in the World of Economics is unparalleled — He will do an outstanding job. Congratulations Stephen!” Trump said through a post on Truth Social.The nomination of Stephen Miran could raise fresh concerns about political pressure on the Federal Reserve, an institution long valued for its independence from day-to-day politics. That independence is considered essential for making tough decisions, such as raising interest rates to control inflation, reports AP.As a Fed governor, Miran would have a vote on all interest-rate decisions and regulatory policies, and his appointment is expected to tilt the balance in favor of lowering interest rates. This is in contrast with the outgoing governor, Adriana Kugler, who aligned with Jerome Powell to advocate for holding rates steady while assessing the economic impact of tariffs.Trump has previously called on Federal Reserve policymakers, including Chair Jerome Powell, the six other Board members, and the 12 regional Fed bank presidents, to lower interest rates, reports Reuters.The Federal Reserve held its benchmark interest rate steady at 4.3 percent in a recent meeting, maintaining the level set after three rate cuts late last year. However, two Fed governors, Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman, both appointed during Trump’s first term, dissented from the decision.""I look forward to quickly considering his nomination in the Senate Banking Committee and hearing more about his plans to increase transparency and accountability at the Federal Reserve to ensure the agency prioritizes its mandate and avoids politics,"" said Tim Scott, the Senate Banking Committee chairman.The Senate is not scheduled to return until September 2, at which time lawmakers will also face the urgent task of passing a government funding bill to avoid a partial shutdown at the end of the month, reports Reuters.Trump is also reportedly considering potential candidates to succeed Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, whose term concludes on May 15, 2026.“Jerome ‘Too Late’ Powell, a stubborn MORON, must substantially lower interest rates, NOW.

The Bank of England on Thursday trimmed its key interest rate by 25 basis points to 4 per cent, marking the fifth reduction since August 2024, as it seeks to support Britain’s slowing economy amid concerns over rising US tariffs and domestic tax hikes.The latest cut brings borrowing costs to their lowest level since March 2023, with Governor Andrew Bailey cautioning, “Interest rates are still on a downward path, but any future rate cuts will need to be made gradually and carefully.” The move came despite inflation rising to an 18-month high of 3.6 per cent in June, well above the BoE’s 2 per cent target, driven by persistent fuel and food prices.As per news agency AFP, the BoE now expects inflation to peak at 4 per cent next month, before easing back to target by the second quarter of 2027. The central bank also raised its growth forecast slightly, expecting the UK economy to expand by 1.25 per cent this year, up from the earlier 1 per cent estimate.While the direct impact of US tariffs is “milder than feared,” the central bank noted that broader uncertainty linked to tariff policies continues to dampen business sentiment.In May, the UK and the US agreed to lower tariffs, previously set above 10 per cent, on select British exports, including cars.However, baseline tariffs of 10 per cent on most UK goods introduced by US President Donald Trump in April remain in place.The BoE’s Monetary Policy Committee faced an unprecedented situation during its deliberations. Initially split in a three-way vote, four members backed the cut, four favoured no change, and one called for a deeper 0.5 per cent cut, the decision passed only after a second round of voting, a first since the bank gained independence in 1997.The UK economy contracted for a second consecutive month in May, and unemployment has climbed to 4.7 per cent, its highest since 2021.As per AFP, analysts, including those at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, believe the Labour government’s decision to raise business taxes in April has also weighed heavily on business activity.“There are slightly more risks on the downside to activity,” said Bailey after the rate cut, as per AFP. “Economic growth is subdued, the labour market continues to loosen and consumption growth may take longer to pick up.”Treasury chief Rachel Reeves welcomed the BoE’s move, saying it would help reduce costs for “mortgages and loans for families and businesses.” She added that the government remained focused on boosting long-term growth through infrastructure investment and trade partnerships.Expectations that rates will remain steady at 4 per cent for longer have lent support to the pound, even as some traders remain cautious ahead of the Autumn Budget.","The Bank of England on Thursday trimmed its key interest rate by 25 basis points to 4 per cent.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.","Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain.

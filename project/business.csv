Stock market recommendations:Benchmark indices extended their pullback for the second consecutive week amid strong global market momentum. The Reserve Bank of India’s recent dovish stance, aimed at fostering credit growth, provided crucial support to market sentiment. In its latest policy decision, the RBI kept the repo rate steady at 5.5%, signaling a cautious but accommodative approach.After a robust up move, where the Nifty surged over 600 points within just four sessions from 24,588 to 25,220, the index has entered a phase of consolidation over the past two sessions. Moving forward, the Nifty needs to decisively close above the 25,220 marks for a meaningful pullback to take shape. Failing this, the index is likely to continue oscillating within the 25,220 to 24,700 range, driven largely by stock-specific movements ahead of the Q2FY26 earnings season.On the upside, a sustained move above Tuesday’s high of 25,220 would pave the way for further gains towards the 25,400-25,500 levels, where the trendline resistance connecting the major highs of June and September 2025 lies.On the downside, strong support is seen between 24,800 and 24,700, marked by the confluence of the 20-day and 50-day exponential moving averages (EMA) and the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement of the recent rally from 24,588 to 25,220.Key Monitorables Going Forward:Overall, the market appears poised for cautious consolidation, supported by favorable macro factors but awaiting clearer direction from earnings and global cues.Bank Nifty displayed notable relative strength throughout the week, outperforming Nifty as buying momentum returned across major banking stocks post RBI monetary policy meeting. The strong up move in the last 2 weeks reflects renewed bullish sentiment, indicating that the banking sector is regaining leadership. Sustained buying momentum could further strengthen investor confidence and drive additional upside in the coming weeks.Bank Nifty after a 2300 points up-move in just 6 sessions is witnessing consolidation in the last 2 sessions. We expect the index to consolidate in the range of 56,500-55,500 thus forming a base for the next leg of up move.On the higher side a move above Tuesday’s high of 56500 would open further upside towards the all-time high of 57,300-57,600 in the coming weeks.On the downside support is placed at 55,500-55,000 levels being the confluence of the 20- & 50-days EMA and the 61.8% retracement of the last up move (54,227-56,502). We believe bias remains positive and dips should be used as a buying opportunity.Jayaswal Neco Industries (JNIL’s) strong captive iron ore resource base in Chhattisgarh provides a structural advantage in securing raw material supplies, with mining leases valid through 2052–2055 and scalable production potential up to 4 MTPA. Expansion across the value chain, including a 1.5 MTPA pellet plant and a new beneficiation facility, positions the company to capture higher value-added margins and operational efficiencies. The upcoming washery expansion, expected by October 2025, is set to deliver annual cost savings of ₹800–900 million, further improving profitability.In parallel, JNIL’s proactive debt refinancing of ₹23 billion with Tata Capital marks a pivotal balance sheet improvement, lowering borrowing costs from 17.5% to 12.5% and extending repayment tenure to 72 months. This move will enhance cash flow visibility, strengthen liquidity, and improve credit metrics. Collectively, these operational and financial initiatives support a positive outlook on JNIL’s earnings trajectory and reinforce confidence in the company’s long-term value creation potential.The stock has confirmed a breakout from an inverse head and shoulders pattern, decisively moving above its falling trendline resistance.After a phase of prolonged consolidation, it is now breaking out of its trading range, indicating a potential shift in trend.Key supports are placed at ₹240 and ₹225, while on the upside, immediate resistance is seen around ₹300 being the recent range breakout. The breakout is further validated by rising volumes, reinforcing bullish momentum.","According to Bajaj Broking Research, the top stock picks for October 10, 2025 are Jayaswal Neco Industries, and Bank of Baroda.

Drama In Kuwait: EU Bigwig BLAMES Gulf States For Bloc's Failure In Isolating Russia | Watch



What Nayara is doing to sustain operations?





Nayara Energy, the Indian refinery with major Russian ownership, is scrambling to sustain operations after being hit by European Union sanctions. The Russian-owned refinery, facing exclusion from many international markets due to severe EU sanctions implemented on July 18, has been compelled to redirect additional fuel towards domestic consumption whilst seeking alternative export destinations, amongst various necessary adaptations required by the EU restrictions.According to a Reuters report, from late August onwards, Nayara Energy's refinery has intensified its railway usage, dispatching two to three trains daily, each comprising 50 tanker cars to transport fuel to inland storage facilities. This is more than twice its previous railway utilisation for diesel and petrol transportation.Nayara's Russian ownership exemplifies the enduring close relationship between New Delhi and Moscow, a connection that positions India differently from Western allies.The government has found itself managing a delicate situation with Nayara's ongoing difficulties, providing essential operational support whilst being cautious not to trigger Western opposition, according to government and company officials quoted in the report. The administration's assistance includes allocation of tank wagons and authorisation for coastal vessels to transport the refinery's products.The refinery, with Russian state oil corporation Rosneft as its primary stakeholder, now sources its crude oil requirements exclusively from Russia, following the cessation of Iraqi and Saudi Arabian supplies post-EU sanctions. This dependency creates potential vulnerabilities should supply chains face disruption from enhanced sanctions or increased pressure from the Donald Trump administration.The UK government is evaluating dual strategies: supporting Nayara whilst being cognisant of mounting international pressure for stricter sanctions, according to Amitendu Palit, senior research fellow at the National University of Singapore's Institute of South Asian Studies quoted in the report.""Long-term support might not be sustainable unless the whole global dynamics change - like a resolution between Russia and the U.S.A. or progress in Russia-Ukraine conflict,"" he said.The Mumbai-based Nayata holds significant influence in India's expanding fuel industry, contributing 8% of refined products output and managing over 6,500 petrol stations.The company has been compelled to decrease crude processing at its 400,000-barrel-per-day Vadinar refinery to 70-80% capacity - down from its previous 104% - as it encounters difficulties securing export customers for its fuel and banking institutions to process payments, according to sources familiar with refinery operations.Nayara adapted its operations by increasing railway transportation after sanctions impeded its coastal shipping and export capabilities, necessitating domestic distribution of its products, the Reuters report said.The refinery, lacking pipeline connectivity, received assistance from the government to access additional railcars and temporary permission to operate four coastal vessels, including the sanctioned Leruo and two vessels from the shadow fleet: the Garuda (Guinea-Bissau flag) and Chongchon (Djibouti flag), the report said.The company has requested governmental authorisation for two additional coastal vessels. Additionally, Nayara seeks official support to acquire equipment and materials, currently restricted by sanctions, for its maintenance closure initially planned for February. Sources indicate the company might postpone the shutdown until April whilst searching for alternative materials.""We are under constant threat,"" a senior company official said on condition of anonymity, citing the worry that vessels the company is now using could come under future Western sanctions.""We never anticipated that we would be hit so directly. Now, every day feels like firefighting.""Nayara - the name is a mix of Hindi and English for ""New Era"" - previously operated as Essar Oil before its 2017 acquisition by Rosneft alongside a consortium including Russian fund UCP and Trafigura, with the latter later divesting its stake.The company sourced oil from diverse nations until 2022. Subsequently, India increased its Russian oil imports at discounted rates following Western sanctions on Moscow post the Ukraine invasion, becoming the primary buyer of Russian seaborne crude.The refiner's primary concerns centre on maintenance issues and international payment capabilities, according to internal sources at Nayara quoted in the Reuters report.Since August, the state-owned SBI has halted processing of trade and forex transactions for Nayara, citing concerns about EU sanctions.Despite meetings between Nayara officials, finance ministry representatives and banks to address these banking complications, a resolution remains pending. This situation hampers the company's ability to conduct international crude imports and fuel exports, as per government sources.Recent shipments have been directed to the Middle East, Turkey, Taiwan and Brazil, with 16 cargo loads of diesel, gasoline and jet fuel transported via EU-sanctioned vessels, according to available data.","Nayara Energy, the Indian refinery with major Russian ownership, is scrambling to sustain operations after being hit by European Union sanctions.

The meeting between US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping is still very much on the table even as the two countries get embroiled in escalating trade tensions.US treasury secretary Scott Bessent on Monday said that he still expects a meeting between the two presidents.""He will be meeting with Party Chair Xi in Korea - I believe that meeting will still go ahead,"" Bessent told Fox Business.He further added that the two sides have had ""substantial communication"" over the weekend after Beijing did not respond to US queries, likely concerning last week’s announcement on rare-earth export controls.The Chinese measures impose strict global controls on products containing even small amounts of certain rare earths, sparking a sharp response from the White House.Earlier on Friday, Trump threatened to cancel his planned meeting with Xi at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in South Korea later this month and announced an additional 100% tariff on Chinese goods starting November 1, Bloomberg reported.""This is China versus the world - they've aimed a bazooka at the supply chains and industrial base of the entire free world, and we're not going to accept that,"" Bessent said.The treasury chief emphasised that ""we will not let these export restrictions and monitoring continue.

He expects to meet China’s vice premier ""in Asia"" before the Trump-Xi encounter.

I-T refunds drop 16% due to checks against frauds,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/i-t-refunds-drop-16-due-to-checks-against-frauds/articleshow/124541426.cms,"



NEW DELHI: Income tax refunds have declined 16% so far this year as authorities have built filters for payments above a specified threshold to guard against frauds.Latest data released by the Central Board of Direct Taxes on Monday showed that between April and Oct 12, gross direct tax collections were 2.4% higher at Rs 13.9 lakh crore as the impact of a sharp reduction in personal income tax showed. During this period, according to the official data, refunds fell from over Rs 2.4 lakh crore to little above Rs 2 lakh crore as non-corporate tax refunds almost halved to Rs 62,359 crore from over Rs 1.2 lakh crore in the corresponding period last year.“Due to automated validation and additional risk-assessment checks put in place at CPC to prevent incorrect refund claims, which sometimes take additional time to ensure accuracy. All ITRs (income tax returns) in which refunds claimed are above a particular threshold are going through additional checks,” said an official, adding that the threshold differs depending on the category of taxpayers. A fall in refunds has meant that net direct tax collections went up 6.3% to almost Rs 11.9 lakh crore so far this year.",Income tax refunds have declined 16% so far this year.

‘Fight to the end’: China warns against Trump’s 100% tariffs; ‘door remains open’ for negotiations,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/fight-to-the-end-china-warns-against-trumps-100-tariffs-door-remains-open-for-negotiations/articleshow/124541749.cms,"Beijing Warns U.S. Retaliation Coming If Trump Imposes 100% Tariffs On Chinese Goods





China gave a stern warning to the US on Tuesday, saying that it is prepared to “fight to the end” as the trade conflict between the two economic giants continues to grow.These remarks come after US President Donald Trump announced imposing an additional tariff of 100% on Chinese imports to the country. This takes the total tariff on the Asian country to 130%.“On the matter of tariff wars and trade wars, China’s position remains consistent,” said an unnamed spokesperson from the commerce ministry.“If you wish to fight, we shall fight to the end; if you wish to negotiate, our door remains open,” AFP quoted the spokesperson.Trump on Friday said that the new tariffs were a direct response to Beijing’s recent decision to implement wide-ranging export controls on rare earths, a sector where China holds a dominant position.The move also unsettled financial markets and cast doubt over a planned meeting between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea. In addition to the tariffs, the US president cautioned that Washington would also introduce export controls “on any and all critical software” from November 1, according to AFP.China defended its actions, calling the rare earths measures legal and necessary. The commerce ministry spokesperson said China wanted to “reiterate that export control measures concerning rare earths and related items constitute legitimate actions by the Chinese government to improve its export control system in accordance with laws and regulations”.“As a responsible major power, China has consistently and resolutely safeguarded its own national security and international collective security,” the spokesperson added.","China says it is prepared to ""fight to the end"" if the U.S. imposes 100% tariffs on Chinese imports.

MUMBAI: There are sign that sales of some segments of insurance policies, like term and health covers, has picked up sharply after the exemption in GST came into effect on September 22, even as life insurance industry growth numbers for September came in weak. What appears to have prompted people to time their purchases is a clarification from the finance ministry on the incidence being dependent on the date of payment of premium and not other factors.According to data released by the insurance regulator, there was a 5.7% dip in first year premium in individual regular premium policies. Industry insiders say that while customers held back from purchases in the first half of Sept there has been a spike in sales after the GST exemption. “Yes, we are seeing a significant jump in policy sales post GST cut across all channels,” said Anand Roy, MD & CEO, Star Health Insurance.“We are witnessing a definite surge in health insurance sales ever since the GST exemption on individual health insurance premiums came into effect. “Trends data also shows a noticeable uptick in health insurance–related searches across India since the announcement, underscoring the growing consumer interest and intent to purchase,” said Ankur Kharbanda, executive director & chief business officer at Niva Bupa Health Insurance.“Following the recent GST exemption on term insurance, we have witnessed a noticeable surge in customer engagement and enquiries for our term proposition. The exemption has not only improved affordability but also reinforced the relevance of pure protection products in overall financial planning,” said Satishwar B, MD and CEO Bandhan Life.An analysis of daily sales of policies by Policybazaar, shows that the current average demand surge from the pre-GST baseline (until Sept ’25) has surpassed even the spike last seen during the pandemic years.According to a clarification issued by finance ministry, all individual life and health insurance policies, including reinsurance of such covers, are now exempt from GST. The exemption took effect from September 22, 2025.","Sales of some segments of insurance policies, like term and health covers, has picked up sharply after the exemption in GST came into effect on September 22.

CHENNAI: Taiwan-based electronics major Hon Hai Technology Group (Foxconn) has announced an investment of Rs 15,000 crore for various manufacturing projects in Tamil Nadu , the state’s industries minister TR B Rajaa said.While details of the projects were not disclosed, it is learnt that Foxconn is likely to invest in electric vehicle batteries, among other technology products, potentially creating job opportunities for around 14,000 people in the state.A Foxconn delegation led by Robert Wu, India representative and senior global executive of the company, met Tamil Nadu CM M K Stalin here on Monday.Tamil Nadu govt has also agreed to set up a ‘Foxconn Desk’ at Guidance TN — a coordination and trade facilitation cell under the state’s nodal agency for industrial investment promotion. While country-specific facilitation desks are already operational, this is the first such cell dedicated to a company.Robert Wu was quoted as expressing Foxconn’s confidence in Tamil Nadu’s industrial policies, talent pool, infrastructure readiness, and ease of doing business. Foxconn did not immediately respond to TOI ’s query, and the state industries ministry declined to share additional information.The announcement comes amid global tariff-related uncertainties and questions over challenges in attracting new manufacturing FDI. According to a press note from the Tamil Nadu industries department, these investments are part of Foxconn’s next phase of growth in India, focusing on value-added, R&D-integrated manufacturing and automated operations. With about 41,000 employees, Foxconn’s largest footprint in India is in Tamil Nadu, where it assembles Apple iPhones and related components such as enclosures and display modules. The company also has major operations in Karnataka and is building a manufacturing complex in Jewar, UP.Foxconn chairman Young Liu, during his visit to Tamil Nadu last year to inaugurate a workers’ dormitory near Chennai, said the state’s economic blueprint is attractive for technology investments. The company is reportedly planning to set up largescale manufacturing facilities outside the Chennai region to enable easier land acquisition and labour mobilisation.","Taiwan-based electronics major Hon Hai Technology Group (Foxconn) has announced an investment of Rs 15,000 crore for various manufacturing projects in Tamil Nadu.

"Retail inflation eases to 1.5% in September, lowest level in 8 years",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/retail-inflation-eases-to-1-5-in-september-lowest-level-in-8-years/articleshow/124541199.cms,"Representative image





NEW DELHI: Retail inflation eased to a 99-month low in Sept as food prices moderated and a favourable base effect helped, triggering hopes of a cut in interest rates in the months ahead.Data released by the National Statistics Office (NSO) on Monday showed inflation, as measured by the consumer price index (CPI), rose an annual 1.5% in Sept, slower than the 2.1% in Aug and well below the 5.5% in September last year.The NSO said that there is a decrease of 53 basis points in headline inflation in Sept compared to Aug and it is the lowest year-on-year inflation after June, 2017.Rural inflation was at 1.1% during the month while urban was slightly higher at 2%. Food inflation contracted 2.3% in Sept and it was the fourth month in a row when it has been in the negative territory. There was a decrease of 164 basis points in food inflation in Sept compared to Aug and it is the lowest after December, 2018.The data showed that vegetable inflation contracted 21.4%, pulses and products fell 15.3% and spices contracted 3.1%.Core inflation, which strips out food and fuel, soared to a 25-month high at 4.6% on the back of a spurt in housing and gold inflation.According to data from Crisil, housing inflation was at a four-month high of 4% while gold was at a decade high rate of nearly 47%.“We expect the CPI inflation to average 2.6% in FY2026, dampened by the GST rationalisation as well as the continued benign food prices. A final 25 basis points rate (bps) cut is possible in Dec, with its timing contingent on the degree of further transmission of the cumulative 100 bps rate cuts to the credit market, as well as the growth implications of the GST rejig and tariffs,” said Aditi Nayar, chief economist at ratings agency Icra.RBI has maintained a pause in interest rates since it cut rates by 50 basis points in June.“Moderating inflation provides the RBI with greater room to focus on supporting economic growth in the midst of rising external headwinds and uncertainties surrounding the trade negotiations with the US. In case growth indicators weaken, the latest inflation figures open the door for a potential 25 bps rate cut in Dec,” said Rajani Sinha, chief economist at ratings agency CareEdge.",Retail inflation eased to a 99-month low in Sept.

Residents in several parts of the UAE are being advised to brace for rainy weather, lower temperatures, and dusty winds between Friday, October 10, and Tuesday, October 14, as a shifting weather system moves through the region, primarily affecting the northern and eastern areas.The National Centre of Meteorology (NCM) has forecast a period of unstable weather conditions starting Friday, October 10, through Tuesday, October 14, due to the influence of an extended surface low-pressure system from the south and an upper-level low carrying relatively cold and humid air. These upper-level low-pressure systems tend to intensify with altitude and are typically linked with cloud development and rainfall.During this five-day stretch, weather models indicate that areas most likely to experience rain include Ras Al Khaimah, Fujairah, and Al Ain, while major coastal cities like Dubai and Abu Dhabi are expected to remain largely dry. The Windy app projects the rain will begin on Sunday. Forecasts describe the expected rainfall as light to moderate overall, with some areas experiencing heavy rain intermittently. This weather activity is expected to affect primarily the northern and eastern regions, with the potential to extend inland and toward some western areas.There is also a limited chance of hailstones forming in certain locations.In addition to rain, a noticeable drop in temperatures is expected across several affected regions. Windy conditions may intensify at times, potentially kicking up dust and sand. These conditions may reduce visibility in some areas and could affect outdoor plans, especially during the weekend. Sea conditions are also likely to be impacted, with wave activity in both the Arabian Gulf and the Oman Sea ranging from slight to moderate, occasionally becoming rough.September and October are typically among the most humid months of the year in the UAE, with humidity sometimes reaching 100 percent. However, this year has seen relatively drier conditions leading up to this weather shift. With forecasts predicting a cooler, wetter period, residents and travelers are advised to monitor updates and plan accordingly.","From October 10-14, Ras Al Khaimah, Fujairah, and Al Ain are expected to experience light to moderate rain and dust.

Sfeer Loyalty Program: A community-centric approach

Hafawa Lounge: Riyadh Air’s first premium ground experience

Strategic significance: Vision 2030 and the aviation push









Saudi Arabia’s newest national airline, Riyadh Air, is preparing for a strategic soft launch of its first international route — daily flights between Riyadh and London Heathrow — beginning October 26, 2025. While tickets won’t be publicly available yet, this tightly managed rollout marks a crucial proving phase as the airline gears up for full-scale commercial operations in 2026.Backed by the Public Investment Fund (PIF), Riyadh Air is positioning itself as a future global aviation leader, with this initial route serving not only as a testbed for systems, aircraft, and service procedures, but also as a key milestone in the Kingdom’s broader Vision 2030 strategy.Riyadh Air’s first operational route will connect King Khalid International Airport in Riyadh with London Heathrow Airport, one of the world’s busiest and most tightly controlled hubs. But these initial flights won’t be open for general ticket sales. Instead, the seats will be available exclusively to Riyadh Air employees, staff at the airline’s owner — Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF) — and their families.The reason for this controlled opening is strategic. While the airline secured a pair of coveted Heathrow slots back in June for the Northern Hemisphere winter season, it does not yet have its own aircraft. Riyadh Air’s order with Boeing for 72 Dreamliners — 39 firm orders for the 787-9 model and 33 options — originally targeted first deliveries by December 2024. That schedule has now been pushed back due to production delays, with the first jets now expected in late 2025.To avoid losing the Heathrow slots under the airport’s strict “use it or lose it” rules, Riyadh Air is launching the route using a leased Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner from Oman Air. The aircraft, named Jamila and registered as HZ-RXX, is currently being used for pilot training, certification flights, and operational trials.Passengers on these early flights will be considered “Launch Members” and will be invited to share detailed feedback on every part of the journey — from booking and boarding to in-flight experience and ground handling. Tickets for these flights will only be available through the airline’s newly unveiled loyalty platform, Sfeer.Speaking at the official announcement, Riyadh Air CEO Tony Douglas made it clear that this staged approach is a deliberate choice, not a compromise.“If you go big bang on day one and assume everything will work perfectly on the first day, well, the reality is it won’t,” he said. “So we will use that short period to trial everything and make sure the feedback gives us the opportunity to polish every last little detail before I actually sell a ticket to you.”The new Riyadh–London route spans 3,070 miles with a flight time of approximately 7 hours, making Riyadh Air the fourth airline to operate on this corridor.While Saudia currently maintains a strong presence on the route, it is gradually withdrawing from Riyadh-based services to make way for Riyadh Air, which will become the Kingdom's flagship international airline.Though Riyadh Air is just beginning operations, its long-term ambitions are substantial. The airline was officially announced in March 2023 by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and is a cornerstone of the Kingdom’s Vision 2030, an economic diversification plan that seeks to position Riyadh as a global business and tourism hub.Riyadh Air plans to serve over 100 destinations worldwide by 2030, supported by a modern, fuel-efficient fleet and a focus on premium service across every touchpoint. The scale of its ambition is reflected in its extensive aircraft order book:Riyadh Air’s expansion plans are backed by a massive and diversified aircraft order portfolio:This strategic mix aims to equip the airline with a modern, fuel-efficient fleet for both regional and long-haul destinations.Following the launch of its first route to London, Riyadh Air’s next confirmed destination will be Dubai International Airport. The Riyadh–Dubai corridor is among the busiest in the region, with more than 30 daily flights at peak times, operated by a mix of low-cost and full-service carriers. This route will also mark Riyadh Air’s first direct competition with Emirates, which currently operates three daily Boeing 777-300ER services on the same sector.In parallel, Riyadh Air has been forming strategic partnerships to expand its global reach, including a memorandum of understanding with Delta Air Lines to explore potential codesharing and loyalty program alignment.Alongside the launch announcement, Riyadh Air introduced Sfeer, a digital-first loyalty program designed to reflect modern user behavior and local cultural values. The name — which means “ambassador” in Arabic and echoes the English word “sphere” — captures the program’s vision of building a connected and collaborative member community.Unlike traditional airline programs that reward individual travel spend, Sfeer promotes engagement, inclusivity, and shared progress. Members can share level points with family and friends, advancing together toward higher tiers — a model the airline says reflects Saudi values of generosity and togetherness.In its early access phase, Sfeer is open to Riyadh Air’s internal community, but it will be expanded in phases. Early registrants, dubbed “Founders,” will gain priority access to ticket sales on upcoming flights and invitations to exclusive events. When fully launched in 2026, the program will include gamified challenges, member leaderboards, and a no-expiry points policy. Additional benefits will include complimentary onboard Wi-Fi and special partner offers.Douglas positioned Sfeer as a loyalty program that goes beyond points.“We’re emphasizing inclusivity and engagement, rather than the individual transactional models of traditional airline loyalty programs,” he said. “We want this to be community-driven and digitally immersive — not just another points system.”Riyadh Air has also unveiled its first premium lounge, the ‘Hafawa Lounge’ — located between Terminals 1 and 2 at King Khalid International Airport.The lounge is positioned as an extension of Riyadh Air’s commitment to providing a luxury experience and serves as part of its overall operational trial period. As the airline ramps up toward full public service, every touchpoint, from lounge to inflight, is being tested and refined.Riyadh Air was established in March 2023 by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman as a central pillar of Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030 — the national strategy aimed at diversifying the economy and reducing reliance on oil. The airline’s objectives are closely aligned with the broader ambitions of its owner, the Public Investment Fund (PIF), which include transforming Riyadh into a global aviation hub, attracting 330 million passengers annually by 2030, and enhancing international connectivity through strategic partnerships.One such partnership includes a memorandum of understanding with Delta Air Lines to explore future code-sharing agreements and potential loyalty program integration. Riyadh Air forms just one part of the PIF’s expansive investments in the aviation ecosystem, which also span airports, logistics, and supporting infrastructure across the Kingdom.","Riyadh Air will launch its first London flights on October 26 using a leased Boeing 787-9 for staff only.

China firmly rejected recent US restrictions and sanctions, pledging to take necessary measures to safeguard its legitimate rights and interests.In a post on X Monday, Chinese foreign ministry Spokesperson Lin Jian said, ""China firmly rejects the recent US restrictions and sanctions on China, and will do what is necessary to protect its legitimate rights and interests. ""He emphasised that ""threatening high tariffs is not the right way to deal with China,"" urging Washington to ""correct its approach and act on the common understandings the two presidents reached in their phone calls.""Lin further underlined that ""the two sides can and should address each other's concerns through dialogue and manage differences on the basis of equality, respect and mutual benefit to keep bilateral ties on a steady, sound and sustainable track.""The exchange follows renewed strain between Washington and Beijing after US President Donald Trump threatened new 100 per cent tariffs on Chinese imports. In response, China vowed countermeasures if the US president follows through.A spokesperson for China's ministry of commerce said, as quoted by ANI, ""Resorting to threats of high tariffs is not the right way to engage with China."" They added, ""If the US persists in acting unilaterally, China will resolutely take corresponding measures to safeguard its legitimate rights and interests.Our position on a tariff war remains consistent -- we do not want one, but we are not afraid of one.""The tension escalated after China announced export restrictions on rare earth minerals last week, threatening to derail months of progress in trade negotiations between the two economic powers.In an effort to ease tensions, Trump expressed optimism about bilateral ties and praised Chinese President Xi Jinping. In a post on Truth Social, he wrote, ""Don't worry about China, it will all be fine! Highly respected President Xi just had a bad moment. He doesn't want Depression for his country, and neither do I. The USA. wants to help China, not hurt it!!! President DJT.""The White House also posted on X, stating, ""It is impossible to believe that China would have taken such an action, but they have, and the rest is History. Thank you for your attention to this matter!""The rapid escalation has rattled global markets, sinking stocks and raising fears of a repeat of the earlier tit-for-tat tariff war, which saw duties on Chinese and American imports rise to around 145 per cent and 120 per cent respectively, according to CNN.The rising tensions have also cast doubt over the planned meeting between Trump and Xi Jinping in South Korea in two weeks, with Trump citing the rare earths issue and expressing uncertainty over whether the meeting will go ahead.","China firmly rejects recent US restrictions and sanctions, pledging to take necessary measures to safeguard its legitimate rights and interests.

JPMorgan Chase on Monday unveiled a $1.5 trillion plan to bolster key US industries, including rare minerals, shipbuilding, and nuclear energy, in a move it described as critical for national security and economic resilience.The US banking giant, which manages assets of about $3.8 trillion, said it would deploy direct equity and venture capital investments of up to $10 billion in select companies. It also plans to facilitate funding for projects deemed essential to the nation’s economic security, according to an announcement on its website, AFP reported.CEO Jamie Dimon framed the initiative as a response to growing global uncertainties. In a Wall Street Journal op-ed, Dimon cited conflicts in Ukraine and other international hotspots as evidence that “the world is far from safe” and warned that US dependence on external sources for critical minerals and manufacturing could threaten national security.“The US has allowed itself to become too reliant on unreliable sources of critical minerals, products, and manufacturing — all of which are essential for our national security,” Dimon wrote.“Our adversaries and potential adversaries aren’t waiting — we no longer have the luxury of time.”The plan spans JPMorgan’s investment and commercial banking arms, and will include efforts to support research and development, streamline permitting, and navigate regulatory hurdles. Priority sectors include defense and aerospace, energy independence, and supply chain resilience. The initiative also identifies 27 sub-areas such as AI, where the US leads globally, alongside sectors like shipbuilding where the country lags (AFP).Supply chain weaknesses became especially visible during the Covid-19 pandemic, when semiconductor shortages disrupted auto manufacturing and other industries. To address such vulnerabilities, Congress passed the CHIPS and Science Act in 2022, authorising $280 billion to strengthen domestic production, the bank noted.The initiative comes amid heightened focus on critical materials under the Trump administration, which has taken stakes in private companies such as Intel and MP Materials, a departure from traditional US free-market practices. Tensions over control of critical minerals have also added strain to US-China relations, with both countries competing in strategic areas including artificial intelligence","JPMorgan Chase unveiled a $1.5 trillion plan to bolster key US industries, including rare minerals, shipbuilding, and nuclear energy.

Wall Street staged a strong rebound on Monday as US stocks rallied following President Donald Trump’s calmer comments on trade with China, just days after his threats of higher tariffs had rattled global markets.The S&P 500 surged 1.5% to recover more than half of Friday’s drop, its steepest since April. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 561 points, or 1.2%, while the Nasdaq composite jumped 2% as of 12:02 p.m. Eastern time, AP reported.“Don’t worry about China,” Trump said on his social media platform Truth Social on Sunday. He added that China’s leader, Xi Jinping, “doesn’t want Depression for his country, and neither do I. The US wants to help China, not hurt it!!!”The shift followed Trump’s Friday comments, when he had accused China of being “a moral disgrace in dealing with other nations” and threatened an additional 100% tariff on Chinese imports starting Nov. 1, citing Beijing’s “extremely hostile” letter on rare earth export curbs. China urged the US to resolve differences through negotiations rather than threats, stating online: “We do not want a tariff war but we are not afraid of one. ”Trump’s backtrack ahead of Monday trading helped lift market sentiment, raising hopes that the world’s two largest economies could maintain a functioning trade relationship.The market’s volatility echoes April’s swings, when Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariff announcement initially shocked investors before a series of eventual relaxations.Morgan Stanley strategists, led by Michael Wilson, said if trade tensions ease similarly this time, conditions could allow a rolling recovery into 2026.The S&P 500 had already been under pressure after a nearly continuous 35% run since April. Analysts noted that the index remains near all-time highs, prompting concerns that stock prices are outpacing corporate profit growth, particularly in the artificial intelligence sector, where some see echoes of the 2000 dot-com bubble.Broadcom posted a 10% gain, the biggest in the S&P 500 on Monday, following its announcement of a collaboration with OpenAI to design custom AI accelerators. Conversely, Fastenal fell 4.8% after slightly weaker-than-expected quarterly profits.Bank of America strategist Savita Subramanian expressed optimism that S&P 500 companies could outperform analyst expectations in the upcoming earnings season, citing the resilient US economy and a weaker US dollar that boosts overseas sales.Internationally, European markets edged higher, while Asian indexes saw mixed performances. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng fell 1.5%, and Shanghai dropped 0.2% after China reported an 8.3% increase in global exports in September compared with a year earlier, its strongest growth in six months, reflecting a shift in Chinese manufacturers toward non-US markets.","The S&P 500 surged 1.5% to recover more than half of Friday’s drop.

TL;DR: Driving the news

China has rolled out sweeping new export controls that stretch from rare-earth magnets to electric motors, chips and high-performance batteries—with explicit bans on items destined for foreign weapons systems.

The rules, unveiled October 9 and elaborated in a series of October 10–12 notices, start taking effect November 8 and December 1, and apply globally, not just to the US.

Beijing simultaneously moved to restrict the export of technologies needed to process and recycle rare earths - tightening its near-chokehold on the dirtiest, most specialized links of the supply chain.

US President Donald Trump fired back: a public deadline of November 1 for China to relent, a threatened additional 100% tariff on Chinese goods, and potential export controls on “any and all critical software.” He also said he saw “no reason” to meet Xi at an APEC-adjacent summit this month - later suggesting it still might happen.

In a Truth Social post on October 12, Trump added: “Don’t worry about China, it will all be fine! Highly respected President Xi just had a bad moment.”

Why it matters

The curbs hit both consumer and defense arteries - “from cars and computer chips to tanks and fighter jets,” with bans covering “small yet powerful electric motors in missiles and fighter jets” and materials for range finders in tanks and artillery, a New York Times report said

Europe worries about knock-on effects for its Ukraine supply lines and for rebuilding its own militaries; US allies also fear being forced to cough up sensitive technical drawings to secure Chinese licenses, the NYT report added

China processed ~90% of certain rare earths prior to the new rules; curbs on the gear and know-how to replicate those steps are designed to slow “de-risking” efforts abroad.

Why rare earth minerals matter

The big picture

“Reliability is for losers. Strength keeps superpowers safe.”

‘Rethink Policy Or...’: China Warns After Trump Opens 'Russian Airspace Front' Amid Tariff War

In Western embassies and businesses in Beijing, China’s explanations inspire a mixture of alarm and incredulity. Given that Ukraine is being battered, day and night, by Russian drones and missiles packed with Chinese-made components, the ministry’s pious talk of world peace is called “preposterous”. An article in the Economist

Between the lines

This is “shock-and-awe” built for leverage: rules that apply “to the entire world,” force intrusive licensing, and bar transfers of equipment or information that would let others stand up rival production. The tactic mimics elements of US long-arm controls - so closely, diplomats quip, Washington could sue for IP theft, the Economist said.

Beijing has clocked Trump’s appetite for transactional deals. A senior Chinese official told the Economist that Trump was “hijacked” by hawks; an adviser said “Trump’s de-emphasising of ideology” creates “room for pragmatic deals”. That read of Trump as deal-curious may be fueling China’s brinkmanship - and could be a misread if tariffs jump to shut-down levels.

Bloomberg Economics estimates a fresh 100% hike would push effective US rates on Chinese goods to ~140% - “a level that shuts down trade” - though China’s fastest-growing exports (EVs, batteries, ships) are less US-exposed.

Autos/EVs & batteries: New license hurdles and tech-export bans could slow foreign battery plants and EV supply chains that rely on Chinese cathode/anode materials, separators and formation equipment. US and European auto suppliers report months-long delays in getting licenses; the process is “slow and cumbersome”, as per the NYT report.

What they’re saying

“We’ve entered into a new phase of the economic conflict,” said Jay Truesdale, former Obama official on critical minerals, now CEO of TD International.

Beijing’s commerce ministry: “We do not want a tariff war but we are not afraid of one.” Licenses will be granted for “legitimate civilian uses,” given military applications .

JD Vance: if China responds “in a highly aggressive manner, I guarantee you the president of the United States has far more cards than the People’s Republic of China” - while adding Trump “is always willing to be a reasonable negotiator”.

Stimson Center’s Yun Sun warned China may be cultivating “a dangerous new habit” of underestimating US retaliation; seeing compromise as “American weaknesses”.

Trump on October 12: “Don’t worry about China, it will all be fine! Highly respected President Xi just had a bad moment.”

The Communist Party and MAGA agree on one point, at least. In a brutal world, dominance is a surer route to security than the admiration of friends. Other countries may hate where the America-China trade war goes next. Their views will not be sought. The Economist in 'China tries shock-and-awe on Donald Trump'

The trade truce is over. After a few quiet weeks, US and China have lurched back into confrontation, and Beijing chose an opening salvo designed to be seen-and felt-from auto plants to air bases.Two leaders, one shared logic:That bleak creed, as the Economist put it, helps explain why both capitals are volleying threats with little regard for third-country collateral damage.Beijing frames its measures as safeguarding “the security and stability of global supply chains” and - given the military applications - “to better defend world peace,” calling China “a responsible major country”. However, Western embassies in Beijing call that “preposterous.""Meanwhile, the economic backdrop has emboldened Xi. Chinese exports surged 8.3% in September - the fastest in six months - despite a 27% plunge to the US, as sales to the EU and Southeast Asia jumped 14% and ~16% respectively . “China’s exports have remained resilient despite US tariffs,” said SocGen’s Michelle Lam, noting diversified markets and competitiveness, a Bloomberg report said.China’s new rules start November 8/December 1. Trump’s threatened 100% tariff date is November 1, with Treasury-led talks floated for late October in Europe - but the APEC-side Trump-Xi meeting is wobbling.Expect emergency licensing work-arounds, friend-shoring sprints in Australia, Canada, the US and the EU - and political pressure over any Chinese demand for proprietary drawings.If Trump’s 100% tariff lands and Beijing retaliates, Bloomberg Economics warns effective rates would approach “trade-shutdown” territory, amplifying price and supply shocks in EVs, grid gear, aerospace and defense .The more Beijing weaponizes green-tech inputs, the faster capitals move to diversify - but not without years of costly duplication and dirtier processing outside China.(With inputs from agencies)","China has rolled out sweeping new export controls that stretch from rare-earth magnets to electric motors, chips and high-performance batteries.

US President Donald Trump struck a markedly softer tone on China on Sunday, referring to President Xi Jinping as “highly respected” and insisting the United States wants to “help” China, not hurt it, despite escalating tensions over rare earths and looming tariffs.“Don’t worry about China, it will all be fine!” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform. “Highly respected President Xi just had a bad moment. He doesn’t want Depression for his country, and neither do I. The U.S.A. wants to help China, not hurt it!!!

He warned that China was attempting to “hold the world captive” and hinted at a “massive increase of tariffs” on Chinese goods.China’s commerce ministry responded on Sunday to Trump’s earlier threat of a 100% tariff hike, urging Washington to “promptly correct its wrong practices” and engage in “equal-footed consultation.” The statement said: “We do not want a tariff war, but we are not afraid of one.”The ministry warned that if the US “insists on going the wrong way,” China would take “resolute measures” to protect its legitimate interests.It also said the export controls were “not export bans,” emphasising that licences would be issued for civilian and humanitarian uses, such as medical assistance and disaster relief.China accounts for nearly 70% of global rare earth mining and about 90% of processing, giving it a dominant position in global supply chains. The minerals are vital for manufacturing jet engines, smartphones, radar systems, and electric vehicles.The renewed tensions stem from China’s restrictions on exports of rare earth elements and associated technologies, citing national security and concerns over foreign military applications. The Chinese ministry clarified that the new rules are not outright bans, and licenses would be granted for “legitimate civilian uses.”US Vice President JD Vance defended Trump’s tariff threats on Fox News, calling China’s control of critical supplies “the definition of a national emergency.” He insisted the President’s approach was aimed at making the United States more self-sufficient.“It’s going to be a delicate dance,” Vance said, adding that Trump “has far more cards than the People’s Republic of China.” However, he also left room for compromise, saying: “If they’re willing to be reasonable, then Donald Trump is always willing to be a reasonable negotiator.”","US President Donald Trump struck a markedly softer tone on China on Sunday.

How it started: China’s rare earth export curbs



Washington hits back: Trump’s tariff storm



Beijing’s counterpunch: 'We’re not afraid of a trade war'



The bigger picture: leverage, technology, and diplomacy



What’s next: Uneasy truce, global stakes







The trade tensions between the United States and China have flared up once again, after a brief phase of calm, exposing how deep the divide and mistrust between the two giant economies still run.What began as a simmering disagreement over rare earth exports has now escalated into a full-blown confrontation, with both Washington and Beijing accusing each other of provocation and unfair trade practices.The latest round of hostilities began when China announced sweeping new export controls on rare earth metals, critical materials used in semiconductors, electric vehicles, and defense technologies.Beijing said the move was a national security measure, but many saw it as retaliation for Washington’s tightening restrictions on Chinese technology firms.Under the new rules, announced by China’s ministry of commerce, any company — Chinese or foreign — must now seek Beijing’s approval before exporting products containing more than 0.1% rare earth content by value. The ministry also expanded its list of restricted materials and banned the export of rare earths for foreign military use.China, which dominates around 90% of the world’s rare earth supply, also introduced extra port fees on US ships from October 14 and launched an antitrust investigation into US chipmaker Qualcomm, signaling a broader retaliation.The move caught Washington off guard. President Donald Trump said he was “blindsided” by Beijing’s actions, especially since relations between the two nations had appeared “very good” in recent months.Trump announced an additional 100% tariff on Chinese goods starting November 1, raising the overall tariff rate on Chinese imports to about 130%.Washington said the move was in response to China’s ""extraordinarily aggressive"" new export restrictions on rare-earth minerals. ""Based on the fact that China has taken this unprecedented position... the United States of America will impose a Tariff of 100% on China, over and above any Tariff that they are currently paying,"" the US president posted on Truth Social.The announcement stunned investors and sent Wall Street tumbling, marking its worst single-day performance in six months.China’s ministry of commerce hit back swiftly, accusing Washington of “double standards” and “overstretching the concept of national security” through unilateral export restrictions.“For a long time, the United States has adopted discriminatory measures against China, imposing unilateral ‘long-arm jurisdiction’ restrictions on a wide range of products,” the ministry said. It added that the US export control list includes over 3,000 items, compared to around 900 on China’s.The ministry warned, “Threatening high tariffs at every turn is not the right way to engage with China. If Washington persists in acting unilaterally, Beijing will resolutely take corresponding measures to safeguard its legitimate rights and interests.”“Our position on a tariff war remains consistent, we do not want one, but we are not afraid of one,” the ministry added.Experts say China is using its dominance in rare earths as leverage to push for broader concessions — not only in trade, but also in areas like Taiwan, advanced semiconductors, and AI development.“The Chinese saw the leverage they had earlier this year with export controls, so it’s not surprising they would head into these talks to try to stack the deck in their favor,” Jon Hillman, a senior fellow for geoeconomics at the Council on Foreign Relations told Bloomberg.Meanwhile, Trump’s earlier 90-day truce with China in May, which paused new tariffs and controls, had temporarily calmed markets. But the peace didn’t last long — both sides accused each other of backsliding on promises.“Among the Chinese media in China, there is a recognition that China holds the levers and is using the levers to substantially weaken our manufacturing sector including semiconductors, AI and defense articles,” Nazak Nikakhtar, a former US commerce department official, said, Bloomberg reported.“But if you pursue handshake deals, it’s classic game theory: The other side is going to evaluate your response if they renege. And if they think you’re chicken, they’re just not going to adhere to the deal,"" Nazak added.Both Washington and Beijing are now using export controls as bargaining chips ahead of their next scheduled meeting in South Korea. However, Trump has hinted the summit might be canceled due to the renewed tensions.For now, the world’s two largest economies once again stand on the brink of another trade war — one that could reshape global supply chains, shake investor confidence, and test the limits of Trump’s “dealmaking diplomacy.”China's message is clear: “It won’t bow to US pressure.” The US, meanwhile, insists that China’s “unfair practices” cannot go unchecked.","China announces sweeping new export controls on rare earth metals, critical materials used in semiconductors, electric vehicles, and defense technologies.

We do not want to fight, but we are not afraid to fight.""Beijing further accused Washington of escalating economic pressure since September, warning that the US approach was damaging trade relations.""Since the US-China economic and trade talks in Madrid, the US has continuously introduced a series of new restrictions against China,"" the ministry said.The ministry also condemned Washington’s recent trade measures, noting that the US had ""added multiple Chinese entities to ""its export control entity list and specially designated nationals list.""""These actions... have severely harmed China's interests and seriously undermined the atmosphere of the economic and trade talks between the two sides,"" the commerce ministry said.""Threatening high tariffs at every turn is not the right approach to engaging with China,"" it added.These remarks came after Trump announced an additional 100% tariff on Chinese goods starting November 1, raising the overall tariff rate on Chinese imports to about 130%. Washington said the move was in response to China’s ""extraordinarily aggressive"" new export restrictions on rare-earth minerals.""Based on the fact that China has taken this unprecedented position... the United States of America will impose a Tariff of 100% on China, over and above any Tariff that they are currently paying,"" the US president posted on Truth Social.Also Read | 'Hostile order': Donald Trump rekindles trade war — Why has US threatened to impose additional 100% tariff on China? Trump also described Beijing's latest export curbs as ""very hostile,"" claiming China had sent letters ""to countries throughout the world"" outlining restrictions on ""each and every element of production having to do with rare earths.""""There is no way that China should be allowed to hold the world captive,"" Trump said, vowing that the US ""will financially counter their move.""The US President had also hinted that his planned meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping later this month may no longer take place, saying ""there seems to be no reason to do so.""However, speaking to reporters at the White House, Trump clarified that the meeting hadn’t been officially canceled but admitted its fate remained uncertain. ""I haven’t cancelled. However, I’m not sure if we’ll have it,"" he said.Beijing on October 9 announced its decision to impose sweeping new controls on the export of rare earth elements, minerals critical to the US defense, clean energy, and electric vehicle industries.The move was framed by China as a national security measure but was widely interpreted as retaliation for Washington's tightening semiconductor restrictions.Under the new rules, announced by China's ministry of commerce, any company, Chinese or foreign, must now seek Beijing’s approval before exporting products containing more than 0.1% rare earth content by value.The ministry also expanded its list of restricted materials and banned the export of rare earths for foreign military use.Rare earths, while not actually rare, are difficult to extract and process, and China dominates the global market, producing around 90% of the world’s supply.Adding to the strain, China also introduced extra port fees on US ships starting October 14 and launched an antitrust investigation into US chipmaker Qualcomm, signaling broader retaliation against Washington’s tech and trade pressure.These moves represented China's sharpest response in recent months, following US restrictions on semiconductor exports, blacklisting of several Chinese firms, and tighter controls on investment in Chinese technology sectors.Beijing, however, denied any direct link between its export curbs and the US tariffs, saying the restrictions were driven by national security concerns over the military use of these critical minerals amid ""frequent global conflicts.""Moreover, the ministry also clarified that the new rules are not a total export ban and said that applications meeting the necessary requirements ""will be granted licenses.""It added that China had ""notified relevant countries and regions through bilateral export control dialogue mechanisms"" before implementing the changes.","Beijing accused Washington of ""double standards"" following President Donald Trump’s decision to impose an additional 100% tariff on Chinese goods.

TOI correspondent from Washington:

Trump Slaps 130% Tariffs On China As Trade Truce Collapses Over Rare Earth Clash | DETAILS





The trade war between the US and China dramatically escalated this week, reaching a new and alarming phase after tit-fortat export controls that rattled markets even as they were closing on Friday.Barring a pullback by both sides over the weekend, more pain is expected when markets re-open Monday, after a staggering $1.6 trillion was wiped out of the stock market when US President Donald Trump announced retaliatory measures against Beijing’s move to squeeze supply of critical technologies, including rare earths processing, on which it has a stranglehold.Who fired the first shot is a matter of perspective. The US has long weaponised its headstart on technology advances in areas like semi-conductors to punish adversaries (like China and Russia) and even deny it to purported friends (like India). On Thursday, Beijing signalled it has come of age and two can play the game by adopting similar means in areas where it has stolen a march over Washington.China’s ministry of commerce issued four announcements that, collectively, impose new licensing requirements on three critical global supply chains from Nov 8. They include rare earths and processing technology, where the controls will now go beyond minerals to include the specialised machinery and technical knowhow needed to process them into rare earth elements vital for everything from defence systems such as missiles and drones to EVs.For industrial super-hard materials controls were extended to synthetic diamonds and cutting tools used ubiquitously in high-precision manufacturing, including for cutting silicon wafers for computer chips.In addition, controls were placed on high-performance batteries and equipment, with new restrictions targeting lithium-ion batteries used in long-range electric vehicles and advanced drones, as well as the factory equipment necessary for their manufacture. Export controls were also placed on graphite anodes and cathode materials, the essential electrodes for batteries, and equipment to make them.Beijing said the moves are necessary to “safeguard national security and interests” and prevent “dual use”, echoing the rationale the US used for its own export controls on advanced semiconductors.Hours after the Chinese move, Trump condemned the measures as a “hostile order” and announced a staggering economic countermeasure, declaring the US would impose an additional 100% tariff on all Chinese goods, on top of existing duties from Nov 1. White House also announced new export controls on “any and all critical software”. The office of the US trade representative said the president is “responding forcefully and appropriately to safeguard America’s economic and national security”, accusing Beijing of “ordering the entire world to submit for approval to the Chinese Communist Partycontrolled govt any export containing rare earths processed or mined in China”.However, experts are divided on who started the trade scrap, with even many Western analysts suggesting it is Washington that has been picking fights, including expanding its entities list, in an effort to constrain China’s rise. Just this week the US added 15 Chinese companies to its restricted trade list, targeted China-based refineries buying Iranian oil with new sanctions, and announced new port fees on Chinese-made freight vessels beginning Oct 14.Some experts feel China’s “all-in” move on export controls is a direct response to this prior US pressure, seeking to demonstrate its own powerful leverage. Rush Doshi, a former national security council official, believes the timing of China’s move — weeks before a planned meeting between Trump and Xi at APEC summit — indicates Beijing believes the US “will fold” without a strong retaliatory play.Not if you believe Trump, derided with the acronym TACO (Trump Always ChickensOut). “For every element that they (Chinese) have been able to monopolise, we have two. I never thought it would come to this but perhaps, as with all things, the time has come,” he said in a post on Truth Social.","$1.6 trillion was wiped out of the stock market when US President Donald Trump announced retaliatory measures against Beijing.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran Udaan until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.Udaan built an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business still accounts for a very small part of India’s overall retail market but can balloon to $150 billion in sales and yield a 100% return on capital invested in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co. estimates published in the Mint newspaper.Bengaluru-based Udaan has also ventured into financing through its fintech unit which helps shopkeepers get working capital loans to buy inventory. That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says. Udaan competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods. The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-105001128,imgsize-151312,width-400,resizemode-4/105001128.jpg"

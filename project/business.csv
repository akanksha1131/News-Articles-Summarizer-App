Stock market today: Nifty50 and BSE Sensex , the Indian equity benchmark indices, ended in green on Monday on the back of firm global cues.

Gold price prediction today: Gold prices are likely to remain well supported in the near-term and a buy on dips strategy is advisable for investors, says Manav Modi, Senior Analyst, Commodity Research at Motilal Oswal Financial services Ltd. He shares the outlook on gold prices and strategy for gold investors: Gold prices surged to record highs on both Comex and the domestic front last week, while silver also hit new domestic peaks and touched its highest level on Comex since 2011, driven by safe-haven demand amid escalating geopolitical tensions and growing expectations of a US Federal Reserve rate cut. Investor sentiment was further bolstered by weak US labor market data, including a sharp slowdown in non-farm payrolls, which rose by just 22,000 in August against expectations of 75,000, and a rise in the unemployment rate to a near four-year high of 4.3%.These developments have solidified expectations for a 25-bps rate cut at the Fed's upcoming September meeting, with markets now pricing in a nearly 100% probability and even starting to discount a 10% chance of a larger 50-bps cut. Central bank buying added further support, with China increasing its gold reserves for the 10th straight month and Poland proposing to raise its reserve target from 20% to 30%.ETF inflows into gold hit their highest since June 2023, and speculators increased net long positions by over 20,000 contracts.Despite some profit booking, gold held firm near the key $3,600 level and is on track for its best week in three months.This week, all eyes are on the upcoming US inflation data—Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Producer Price Index (PPI)—scheduled just days ahead of the critical Federal Reserve meeting. These data points will be key in confirming whether inflationary pressures are easing enough to warrant the expected 25 or more rate cut. A softer-than-expected inflation data could further weigh on the Dollar index, which has already been under pressure, and further support the bullion rally.Conversely, if inflation surprises to the upside, it may complicate the Fed’s decision for additional rate cuts ahead and influence Governor Powell’s speech at the meet, potentially capping some gains for gold and Silver. However, with labor market data already showing clear signs of cooling and market participants fully pricing in a cut, gold is likely to remain well-supported unless inflation data drastically changes the outlook.","Gold prices are likely to remain well supported in the near-term and a buy on dips strategy is advisable for investors, says Manav Modi, Senior Analyst, Commodity Research at Motilal Oswal Financial services Ltd.

Stock market recommendations:Swiggy is benefitting from easing competition in quick commerce (QC), with slower dark store expansion. With discounting intensity easing and sharper cost discipline, unit economics are improving, supporting a faster path to Instamart profitability. Food delivery (FD) growth, previously impacted by weak sentiment, is set to accelerate.GST-led boost to disposable income & rising discretionary spending should drive higher order volumes and platform engagement.

With stronger QC margins and improved profitability, we upgrade Swiggy to BUY with a revised TP of INR560.Phoenix Mills has expanded aggressively with new malls across Lucknow, Indore, Ahmedabad, Pune, & Bengaluru, along with acquisitions like ISMDPL (Island Star Mall Developers). These initiatives will double its portfolio by FY30, strengthening retail dominance. The company continues to diversify and expand its office portfolio within its existing mall properties across key locations.Management expects Phoenix Mills office portfolio to grow nearly fourfold to 7.1msf by FY27, driving a rental income CAGR of 71% over FY25–27.Looking ahead, new malls under construction and large-scale redevelopments are expected to drive strong consumption growth beyond FY27.

MUMBAI: FMCG companies are on their toes, putting in place strategies so that benefits of the GST cuts can be passed on to consumers from Day 1 (Sept 22) even as they await clarity from govt on labelling and packaging issues.Firms are fast shifting their production to new MRPs and streamlining dispatches, which essentially means that they are holding back production of any old stock unless necessary and prioritising dispatches of the new stock to locations where inventories are low.""We are shifting our production to new MRPs but the challenge will be to deliver the same to consumers in the fastest possible way,"" Tarun Arora, CEO and whole-time director at Zydus Wellness, maker of Complan and Glucon-D, told TOI.Kellanova has fast-tracked packaging changes, planned production runs and streamlined dispatches with its distributor network so that the revised MRPs start reaching shelves as soon as possible after Sept 22, said Prashant Peres, MD at Kellanova South Asia.The challenge to tackle the old stock in the pipeline with higher MRPs can be managed through restickering, but companies will need govt approval for the same.""Alternatively, we will work with our retail partners to sell the products at lower prices,"" Arora said. ""By early or mid-next month, consumers will start seeing reduced prices on FMCG products. Sept may therefore be somewhat choppy with pipeline changes and stock adjustments,"" said Sudhir Sitapati, MD & CEO, Godrej Consumer Products and chairman, CII National Committee on FMCG.Already, distributors are indicating that retailers have slowed purchases from manufacturers to avoid sitting on old stock for long. ""The main concern is how will manufacturers reimburse retailer on the price differential. There's still no clarity on that,"" said Dhairyashil Patil, national president at The All India Consumer Products Distributors Federation. The industry has made representations to govt detailing their concerns.In small packs, benefits will have to be passed by grammage addition, which means changes in packaging, more so in the case of items such as biscuits and chocolates, which are tightly packed. For namkeens, adding grammage in small packs is not a problem as there's always space to make 5-10% additions, said Manoj Verma, COO at Bikaji Foods. "" Changing artwork, and other technicalities can take four to six weeks. Also, if re-stickering is not granted, packaging needs to be changed for new MRPs too,"" said Jeevaraj G Pillai, whole-time director at packaging firm UFlex, which caters to large consumer brands.","FMCG companies are on their toes, putting in place strategies so that benefits of the GST cuts can be passed on to consumers from Day 1 (Sept 22) Firms are fast shifting their production to new MRPs and streamlining dispatches.

China took aim at the United States on Monday, sharply criticizing its 50% tariffs on Indian imports, calling the move “unfair, unreasonable” and making it clear that Beijing firmly opposes the move.China’s ambassador to India, Xu Feihong said that Washington has long taken advantage of free trade, but is now using it as a weapon.Speaking at a seminar marking the 80th Anniversary of the Victory in the Chinese People’s War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression and the World Anti-Fascist War, Xu said, “The United States has long benefited from free trade. But now it is using tariffs as a weapon to demand exorbitant prices... The 50% tariff on India is unfair, unreasonable, and China firmly opposes it.”The ambassador also stressed the importance of strong India-China ties for global development. “As the two most significant emerging economies, China and India should prioritise development and foster mutual support and success. This is what President Xi told PM Modi. PM Modi said that India-China cooperation will make the 21st century a genuine Asian century,” ANI reported him as saying.Xu’s remarks, delivered under the theme Learning from History to Safeguard the Light of Peace, Joining Hands to Chart a Blueprint for Development, highlighted the shared history of both nations and their commitment to peace and progress in Asia.His comments come amid growing economic uncertainty after the US imposed a an additional 25% levy on 27 August as a secondary sanction linked to India’s purchases of Russian crude. This came on the top of an already existing 25% tariff on Indian imports to the country, taking the total to 50%.US President Donald Trump defended these measures and warned that “Phase-2” and “Phase-3” tariffs have not yet been implemented against countries maintaining trade ties with Russia.Speaking at a White House press conference with Polish President Andrzej Duda, he said the secondary sanctions on India targeted Russia’s oil exports. “Would you say that putting secondary sanctions on India, the largest purchaser outside China, they are almost equal. Would you say there was no action? That cost hundreds of billions of dollars to Russia, you call that no action? I haven't done Phase-2 yet or Phase-3,” he said.Trump also reiterated his earlier warning that India could face “big problems” if it continued Russian oil imports. “Two weeks ago, I said if India buys, India has got big problems, and that's what happens,” he added.In a separate interview on The Scott Jennings Radio Show, the US president further claimed that New Delhi had offered a “no tariff” deal following the US decision to raise duties on Indian goods. “India was the most highly tariffed nation in the world, and you know what, they've offered me no tariffs in India anymore. If I didn't have tariffs, they would never make that offer,” he said.Trump further stressed that tariffs are essential for rebalancing trade.“China kills us with tariffs, India kills us with tariffs, Brazil kills us with tariffs. I've understood tariffs better than any human beings in the world,” he claimed. Further, describing the US-India trade relationship as a “one-sided disaster,” he added that India had benefited disproportionately over decades, while American companies struggled to enter the Indian market due to high duties. “They have now offered to cut their tariffs to nothing, but it's getting late. Until now, it was a totally one-sided relationship for many decades,” he concluded.","China’s ambassador to India, Xu Feihong said that Washington has long taken advantage of free trade, but is now using it as a weapon.

South Korea’s LG Electronics is gearing up to launch the initial public offering (IPO) of its Indian subsidiary in October, banking sources aware of the matter told ET. The consumer electronics major is planning to raise around Rs 15,000 crore through the share sale, making it the largest IPO of 2025 so far.According to one of the bankers involved, LG had been waiting for market conditions to stabilise before rolling out the issue. “The company now sees October as the right window,” the person told ET, requesting anonymity.The South Korean giant, which received Sebi’s clearance for the issue in March after filing in December 2024, will divest about 15% in its Indian arm, or 10.2 crore shares. The planned offering will be the second-largest by a Korean company in India, following Hyundai’s blockbuster IPO in October last year.Morgan Stanley India, JP Morgan India, Axis Capital, BofA Securities India, and Citigroup Global Markets India have been appointed as book-running lead managers.The IPO aims to ride the bullish sentiment in India’s primary market, where nearly 30 issues have raised more than Rs 60,000 crore so far in 2025. The largest of these has been HDB Financial Services’ Rs 12,500-crore listing. Another Rs 70,000 crore worth of offerings are expected in the coming months, with Tata Capital (Rs 17,200 crore), Groww, Meesho, PhonePe, Boat, WeWork India, Lenskart, Shadowfax, and Physics Wallah in the pipeline.LG Electronics had initially planned to launch the IPO between April and May this year, but global headwinds—including trade disputes, shifting US tariffs, and geopolitical tensions—forced a delay. These challenges also weighed on valuations, trimming expectations from about $15 billion to a range of $10.5–11.5 billion.","LG Electronics is gearing up to launch the initial public offering (IPO) of its Indian subsidiary in October.

India Fires Back At U.S, Hints At 'Mega Plan' To Fight Trump's Tariffs; 'Undoubtedly Will Buy...'





US President Donald Trump’s 50% tariffs on India could shave off around 0.5% to 0.6% from India’s GDP growth, believes Chief Economic Adviser V. Anantha Nageswaran. The Donald Trump administration had imposed 25% tariffs on India effective August 7, and an additional 25% tariffs for India’s crude oil trade with Russia, which came into effect from August 27.In a Bloomberg TV interview, V. Anantha Nageswaran discussed the potential economic impact of the United States' trade measures. He indicated that the 50% tariffs imposed by Trump on Indian goods could negatively affect India's economic growth.""Depending upon how long it lasts even in this financial year, it may translate into a GDP impact of somewhere between 0.5% to 0.6%,"" he told Bloomberg TV.India's GDP is projected to grow at 6.5% in the current financial year, a figure that may take a hit if the tariffs continue. The first quarter GDP data beat estimates, with a five-quarter high GDP growth of 7.8%.The US tariffs of 50% imposed during Trump's presidency have affected India's export competitiveness in American markets, which is significant as the US remains India's primary trading partner. Industry analysts project these tariffs will affect more than half of Indian exports to America, resulting in substantial financial losses.However, it’s important to note that India's economic growth primarily stems from domestic consumption, with exports playing a relatively smaller role in GDP growth.Experts suggest Trump's tariff impact could be limited to 30-90 basis points. Additionally, the government's initiatives to support exporters and new international trade agreements could help businesses find alternative markets beyond the US.Recently, the Modi government announced broad-based GST rate cuts, benefiting ordinary citizens and the middle class through reduced prices effective September 22, coinciding with Navratras.These measures, which increase consumer spending power at the beginning of the festive period, are anticipated to stimulate India's economic growth through enhanced consumption patterns.",US President Donald Trump's 50% tariffs on India could shave off around 0.5% to 0.6% from India's GDP growth.

PNC Financial Services has announced plans to acquire Colorado-based FirstBank in a $4.1 billion transaction, marking a significant expansion of its footprint in the US retail banking market.Headquartered in Lakewood, Colorado, FirstBank—also known as 1stBank—operates 120 branches and holds $26.7 billion in assets. The lender is privately held, though shareholders owning 45.7% of the company have already voted in favour of the merger, according to a joint disclosure, AP reported.“Its deep retail deposit base, unrivalled branch network in Colorado, growing presence in Arizona, and trusted community relationships make it an ideal partner for PNC,” Bill Demchak, chairman and chief executive officer of PNC, said in a statement.The deal cements PNC as the largest bank in the Denver market while expanding its Arizona network to more than 70 branches. With the acquisition, PNC’s total assets will rise to roughly $575 billion, putting it closer in size to rivals Capital One and US Bank.PNC has been aggressively growing through acquisitions, having purchased the US operations of Spanish lender BBVA for $11.6 billion after the pandemic. The Pittsburgh-based bank has also been adding branches across the Southwest.Alex Overstrom, head of retail at PNC, suggested further growth could follow. “We are not slowing down our organic growth but may consider opportunities as they arise,” he said in an interview.Industry analysts say the deal strengthens PNC’s status as a leading super regional bank, a category that includes lenders like Capital One and Huntington Bancshares. These institutions have been expanding rapidly to compete with Wall Street’s largest players such as JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo.","PNC Financial Services has announced plans to acquire Colorado-based FirstBank in a $4.1 billion transaction.

Screams, Chains, Panic: Inside ICE’s Biggest Worksite Raid; Hyundai Georgia Plant Turns 'War Zone'

South Korean companies jittery about US

The US work visa problems





US President Donald Trump ’s ambitious ‘Made-in-USA’ dream is facing hurdles created by his own administration’s actions. The recent immigration raid on a Hyundai-LG Energy Solution battery facility in Georgia is an example of how Trump’s crackdown on immigrants and move to create jobs in the US, may actually face big hurdles, for now.Law enforcement officials have taken 475 individuals into custody at the complex, and according to reports, LG Energy Solution has postponed the commencement of operations at the facility to the first half of 2026. As reported by Yonhap on Monday, immigration authorities have presented the detained individuals with two alternatives: accept deportation with a five-year ban on re-entry, or remain in detention pending trial.According to a Bloomberg report, industry analysts note that these large-scale manufacturing initiatives, which Trump highlights as achievements in domestic job creation, are encountering difficulties due to immigration enforcement targeting their essential workforce.""Your Investments are welcome, and we encourage you to LEGALLY bring your very smart people, with great technical talent, to build World Class products, and we will make it quickly and legally possible for you to do so,"" Trump said on Truth Social on Sunday, emphasising that whilst the US welcomes foreign investment and skilled workers, proper legal procedures must be followed.Trump has expressed his desire to facilitate the training of US workers by bringing in battery plant specialists.Over the weekend, Korean authorities endeavoured to facilitate the release of 300 detained nationals at a Hyundai Motor Co.-LG Energy Solution Ltd. joint venture construction site, according to Lee's chief of staff Kang Hoon-sik during a high-level meeting between government officials and the ruling Democratic Party.The visa status of the workers and their legal authorisation to work at the site remains uncertain.The enforcement action, despite being unusual in its magnitude and the type of workers affected, is creating anxiety among Hyundai's industry counterparts, including Samsung Electronics Co. and SK On Co., who have also pledged substantial investments in the United States.The timing is also sensitive, following the meeting between South Korean President Lee Jae Myung and Trump that highlighted their partnership and cemented a fresh trade agreement. The arrangement incorporated a $350 billion fund to assist South Korean companies growing their presence in the US, allocating $150 billion specifically for shipbuilding ventures. Additionally, private sector organisations committed $150 billion for direct investment in the US.South Korean conglomerates are working to manage the aftermath, raising apprehension about planned investments worth billions of dollars.The extensive operation caused distress amongst South Koreans when footage emerged showing workers in shackles at the waist, ankles and wrists. This action, part of a larger US initiative against undocumented workers, occurred shortly after a summit between Lee Jae Myung and Donald Trump that highlighted their partnership.""The Georgia episode demonstrates that managing this hurdle with higher tariffs and tighter labor supply will not be an easy task,"" said Homin Lee, a senior macro strategist at Lombard Odier Singapore Ltd., discussing the blanket 15% import duty from the Asian nation. ""We expect South Korea to push for pragmatic tweaks in US visa rules to keep the economic viability of many marquee capex projects,” Homin Lee was quoted as saying by Bloomberg.The presence of South Korean specialists, engineers and sub-contractors is essential for these projects' success. Any restrictions on their movement could potentially disrupt manufacturing schedules, increase expenses and diminish the intended industrial growth. This situation could also affect Hyundai's production expansion plans in Georgia.""Mass production in the first half of 2026 is virtually impossible due to the departure of key personnel during the installation and commissioning phase,"" said Anna Lee, an analyst at Yuanta Securities Korea in Seoul.This enforcement action has introduced uncertainty regarding South Korea's extensive US investment plans. The incident involving workers at a major Korean investment project might signal to other companies that US operations carry heightened political and regulatory challenges.These multibillion-dollar facilities require substantial numbers of international engineers and contractors, yet organisations like Hyundai and LG face considerable obstacles in securing appropriate visas for their specialist personnel.Under Trump's administration, Korean companies in the US have faced difficulties securing work visas, sources told Bloomberg. Particularly, subcontractors have experienced significant visa processing delays, hampering on-site technical discussions and coordination of visits.These staff members, particularly engineers with production line design knowledge, are considered indispensable, according to a battery sector representative. However, local recruitment remains viable for electrical work and basic technical support roles.Immigration enforcement actions draw attention to an ongoing challenge in US-South Korean relations: the significant gap between trade and immigration regulations.South Korea, despite maintaining a free trade agreement with the US since 2012, lacks a dedicated visa allocation, unlike other FTA nations. Whilst Australia, Singapore and Chile enjoy specific visa quotas, and Canada and Mexico operate without limitations under the Treaty National visa scheme, as legal practitioners note. This disparity creates considerable tension for Seoul, revealing a substantial flaw in the economic partnership between the nations.The core challenge stems from US work permit regulations.The H-1B visa category, which maintains an annual limit of 85,000 permits and operates via a random selection process, presents significant obstacles. South Korean organisations struggle to obtain necessary authorisations, typically securing merely 2,000 visas yearly. This limitation has led some Korean enterprises and their associated contractors to utilise B-1 business visas or ESTA for employment activities, according to immigration specialists. These particular visas, however, are exclusively designated for business gatherings or leisure travel, explicitly forbidding any form of employment.According to Monday's Korean media coverage, citing anonymous industry insiders, approximately 30% of B-1 visa applicants succeed, with deployment taking four to five months post-approval. The extensive application process includes corporate invitation letters, contractual documents, CVs and interviews. This has led workers to adopt a pattern of 70-80 day ESTA-based work periods followed by departures and returns, as reported by Chosun Ilbo.""The incident is likely to exacerbate the shortages of legally qualified skilled workers and increase labor cost pressures, which in turn would result in project delays and cost increases across major US construction projects,"" Eugene Investment & Securities Co. analyst Ryu Tae-hwan said. ""Companies' ability to procure and manage labor in America may emerge as a key factor for project execution.""",US President Donald Trump’s ambitious ‘Made-in-USA’ dream is facing hurdles.

In an attempt to pile on economic pressure on Russia, the European Union is weighing a fresh set of sanctions on Russian banks and oil trade to get President Vladimir Putin to end the war against Ukraine.According to a Bloomberg report, this proposed 19th set of measures since the start of the Russia-Ukraine war 2022 may include restrictions on Russian payment and credit card systems, cryptocurrency exchanges, and additional constraints on oil trade.The EU aims to synchronise certain sanctions with the United States, according to sources quoted in the report.

However, he has increased tariffs on India to 50% due to its ongoing Russian oil purchases.Whilst Russia faces severe, crippling sanctions from Western nations, it has managed to mitigate some effects by acquiring restricted goods from China and other nations, whilst finding new markets for its oil and gas products, including India.The US is considering additional measures, including sanctions on Russia's covert oil tanker fleet and energy companies Rosneft PJSC and Lukoil PJSC, alongside other potential actions, as previously reported by Bloomberg.According to sources quoted in the report, the EU's restrictions would enhance sanctions on Russia's unofficial vessels and oil traders in third countries, potentially prohibiting re-insurance for designated tankers.The EU is considering stricter measures against major Russian oil firms by eliminating existing exemptions for companies like Rosneft. Additional considerations include expanding export prohibitions on military-industrial supplies and implementing trade restrictions on international companies, including Chinese firms, that provide these materials.Beijing has emerged as a crucial military supplier to Russia, particularly enabling Moscow to enhance its drone manufacturing capabilities used for attacking Ukrainian cities.The European Union is considering implementing its ""anti-circumvention tool"" against Kazakhstan for the first time, according to sources quoted in the Bloomberg report. This action would prohibit Kazakhstan from importing specific machinery that EU trade data suggests is being redirected to Russia for weapons manufacturing.Sources indicate that implementing this tool requires substantial evidence and unanimous support from EU member states. The proposed sanctions package may undergo modifications during discussions with EU member countries over the upcoming days and weeks.Additional contemplated measures include visa limitations, restrictions on ports handling sanctioned shadow vessels, and controls on military-related services, including artificial intelligence applications.EU ambassadors received a briefing about the proposed package during the weekend, with formal proposals expected to be presented in the near future.Also Read | The 50% misfire: How Trump made Russian oil cheaper for India - And Putin a winner","The European Union is weighing a fresh set of sanctions on Russian banks and oil trade.

China’s exports expanded in August but missed forecasts, weighed down by a sharp fall in shipments to the United States despite gains in Europe and Southeast Asia, official data showed Monday.According to news agency AFP, overall exports rose 4.4% year-on-year, lower than the 5.5% forecast by Bloomberg and down from July’s 7.2% growth.Shipments to the US, China’s largest single-country partner, sank 11.8% from July and 33.1% from a year earlier. However, exports to the European Union climbed 10.4%, while those to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations jumped 22.5%.Imports also grew at a slower pace, rising 1.3% against expectations of 3.4%, AFP reported.Imports totalled $219.5 billion, contributing to a trade surplus of $321.8 billion in August, although this marked the slowest export pace since early 2025, according to news agency AP.Analysts pointed to fading “frontloading” effects, where exporters had accelerated shipments ahead of tariff hikes. “The resilience of Beijing’s exports this year can also be attributed to Chinese businesses pushing for higher market share in other countries, exacerbated by weak domestic demand,” said Zhiwei Zhang of Pinpoint Asset Management, as quoted by AFP.Yue Su of the Economist Intelligence Unit said that “trade diversion remains evident”, reflecting supply-chain diversification to avoid tariffs, a trend also seen in the first US-China trade war.The numbers come as Beijing grapples with weak factory output, a property sector debt crisis and high youth unemployment.In August, Washington and Beijing had extended their tariff truce until November 10, freezing US duties at 30% and Chinese levies at 10%. Reuters noted that analysts expect exports to face pressure in coming months, with Capital Economics warning that “the temporary boost from the US-China trade truce is fading.”US President Donald Trump has repeatedly highlighted America’s leverage over China in the ongoing trade dispute. Speaking in August, he said Washington holds “incredible cards” over Beijing and added, “But I don’t want to play those cards. If I did, that would destroy China. I’m not going to play those cards”.Also read: Donald Trump says he could ‘destroy China’; hints at 200% tariffs on rare earths Trump also singled out China’s rare earths policy, warning that unless Beijing supplied the US with magnets, “we have to charge them 200% tariff or something”.Despite the truce, trade flows have been hit this year, with US imports of Chinese goods down about 15% in the first half of 2025, and American exports to China falling roughly 20% year-on-year, highlighting the ongoing strain in bilateral trade relations.","China's exports expanded in August but missed forecasts, weighed down by a sharp fall in shipments to the United States.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) data centres could emerge as major consumers of global water resources in the next few years, according to a report by Morgan Stanley.The report, as cited by news agency ANI, projected that annual water use for cooling and electricity generation may rise to around 1,068 billion litres by 2028, an 11-fold increase from 2024 levels.The report underlined that while direct water use for cooling is widely recognised, indirect consumption through electricity generation is often overlooked.It added that semiconductor manufacturing, which can consume up to five million gallons of ultrapure water daily, further adds to AI’s water footprint.Morgan Stanley highlighted three possible scenarios, estimating annual water use between 637 billion litres and 1,485 billion litres by 2028, depending on regional energy mixes, cooling technologies, and efficiency improvements. “AI data centers to drive annual water consumption for cooling and electricity generation to approximately 1,068 billion litres by 2028 (our base case) – an 11x increase from 2024 estimates,” the report stated.Electricity generation (scope 2) typically accounts for the largest share of AI-linked water use, followed by direct data centre cooling (scope 1) and semiconductor production (scope 3). More than half of the world’s top data centre hubs are already located in regions facing medium to high water stress, raising concerns of localised impact despite modest global averages.For context, a 2024 study from the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory estimated that US data centres alone consumed 64 billion litres of water directly for cooling in 2023, with indirect water use through electricity generation reaching 800 billion litres.As per The Conversation, companies like Google and Meta disclosed that 95% of their total water use comes from data centre operations, with Google’s Iowa facility consuming 3.8 billion litres in a single year.As AI adoption accelerates, experts warn that efficient water resource management will be critical to ensure sustainability.","Artificial Intelligence (AI) data centres could emerge as major consumers of global water resources in the next few years.

US treasury secretary Scott Bessent said the department would need to refund roughly half of the collected tariffs if the Supreme Court ruled that Donald Trump’s “reciprocal” tariffs exceeded presidential authority.“We would have to give a refund on about half the tariffs, which would be terrible for the Treasury,” Bessent told NBC News.“If the court says it, we’d have to do it,” he added.Talking about alternative measures, Bessent said that they would “diminish President Trump’s negotiating position.”A federal appeals, on August 29, court found that Trump’s “reciprocal” tariffs exceeded presidential authority, ruling that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) does not permit the emergency tariffs he introduced earlier this year.“We discern no clear congressional authorization by IEEPA for tariffs of the magnitude of the Reciprocal Tariffs and Trafficking Tariffs,” the court.The decision has cast doubt on the Trump administration’s capacity to carry on with trade talks. In response, the administration appealed to the Supreme Court on Wednesday, cautioning that eliminating tariffs could leave the nation economically weakened.","US treasury secretary Scott Bessent said the department would need to refund roughly half of the collected tariffs.

Asian markets opened the week on a firm note on Monday, with Tokyo leading gains after Japan's Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba announced his resignation, sending the yen lower and boosting exporters.At the same time, oil prices edged higher as Opec+ signalled a slower pace of output increases.Tokyo’s Nikkei index surged 1.9 percent, supported by a weaker yen, which slipped to 148.14 per dollar from 147.07 on Friday.Analysts said Ishiba’s decision to step down after less than a year in power fuelled political uncertainty in Japan, putting pressure on the currency and government bonds.According to news agency AFP, Michael Brown of Pepperstone said the timing of Ishiba’s announcement was “certainly unexpected” and added that it “introduces significant downside risks for the Japanese yen and for long-end Japanese government bonds.”Other regional markets also traded higher, with Hong Kong and Shanghai up 0.3 per cent, Taipei gaining 0.5 per cent and Seoul advancing 0.3 per cent. Singapore and Wellington inched 0.1 percent higher, while Sydney slipped 0.3 per cent.Investors also weighed weak US labour data as it strengthened expectations of a Federal Reserve rate cut later this month. “Most investors remain aligned on a 25 basis point cut at the September Fed meeting, but a 50bp cut is now in play,” said Harun Thilak of Validus Risk Management, as cited by Reuters.On the commodities front, oil prices recovered part of last week’s losses after Opec+ agreed to raise output more modestly from October.As per Reuters, Brent crude rose 0.5 per cent to $65.84 a barrel, while West Texas Intermediate climbed 0.5 percent to $62.17. Eight Opec+ members will lift production by 137,000 barrels per day from next month, a slower pace compared with recent months.Toshitaka Tazawa of Fujitomi Securities said the modest increase offered “relief” but warned that “downward pressure is likely to persist as Opec+ continues to raise production and supplies ease.”","Tokyo's Nikkei index surged 1.9 percent, supported by a weaker yen.

Eight key members of the OPEC+ alliance announced plans to raise oil production again, in a move analysts view as an effort to secure a larger share of the global crude market.The “Voluntary Eight” (V8) – Saudi Arabia, Russia, Iraq, United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Kazakhstan, Algeria, and Oman, on Sunday said that they would increase daily output by 137,000 barrels from next month, AFP reported.The decision comes as oil prices continue to slide, amid expectations of oversupply in the coming months. Historically, the wider OPEC+ group, which includes the 12-nation Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies, had agreed to output cuts totalling nearly six million barrels per day to prop up prices.Since April, the V8 nations have shifted their focus, prioritising market share through a series of production hikes rather than price support. Analysts had expected last week that the group might maintain current output levels in October.Oil prices have largely hovered between $65 and $70 per barrel this year, tumbling 12% as non-OPEC+ producers ramp up supply and trade tensions weigh on demand.The announcement has surprised markets by signalling a fresh production hike, despite falling oil prices and concerns over global demand.The group, which had already lifted output by 2.2 million barrels per day (bpd) in recent months, said in a statement after an online meeting on Sunday that the new cycle could eventually see up to an additional 1.65 million bpd coming onto the market.""OPEC+ caught the market off guard today -- instead of pausing, the group signalled ambition with a production hike. The barrels may be small, but the message is big,"" said Jorge Leon, an analyst at Rystad Energy.He added, ""OPEC+ is prioritising market share even if it risks softer prices.""The analyst further noted that the real increase would likely be much smaller due to capacity limits and the compensation mechanism, but stressed that market perception often outweighs the actual number of barrels.""The move raises questions about unity: countries like Russia depend on high prices to fund their war machine, while others are willing to test lower prices for market share,"" the analyst told AFP.The coming three months, traditionally a weaker demand period, will prove a major test for the alliance. Market watchers are also monitoring geopolitical factors, including Moscow’s war in Ukraine and strained US-Russia relations.US President Donald Trump, who has failed in efforts to broker peace between Russia and Ukraine, has recently targeted Russian oil exports. In August, he imposed higher tariffs on India for continuing to buy Russian crude.Speaking to Ukraine’s allies via video conference in Paris last Thursday, Trump voiced frustration at continued EU imports of Russian oil, particularly by Hungary and Slovakia.Analysts suggest that curbing Russian exports could open more market space for OPEC+ nations.","Eight key members of the OPEC+ alliance announced plans to raise oil production again.

‘India Profiting From Russian Oil’: Scott Bessent Hits Out Again Over Arbitrage, But Backs China

Russia crude oil trade: More tariffs, sanctions?





US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has called on the European Union to join America in adding pressure on Russia, indicating the possibility of more tariffs and sanctions on countries that are buying Russian crude oil. The Donald Trump administration has already imposed 25% additional tariffs on India for its oil trade with Russia, accusing it of indirectly financing the Russia-Ukraine war.The total tariffs on India now stand at 50% - marking one of the steepest duty rates imposed on any nation globally, due to India's ongoing Russian oil imports during the Ukraine conflict.According to an NBC News report, Bessent indicated on Sunday that the United States is willing to collaborate with European nations on implementing additional sanctions targeting countries purchasing Russian oil, aiming to destabilise the Russian economy.""We are prepared to increase pressure on Russia, but we need our European partners to follow us,"" Bessent told NBC News.Also Read | Trump tariffs on India’s software exports?

Bessent added. ""And if the US and the [European Union] can come in, do more sanctions, secondary tariffs on the countries that buy Russian oil, the Russian economy will be in total collapse, and that will bring [Russian] President [Vladimir] Putin to the table.""Bessent made these observations shortly after Russia conducted its most extensive aerial assault since the war began.These statements followed US President Donald Trump's recent meeting with Putin in Alaska. Subsequently, the US president welcomed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European officials at the White House to explore possible resolutions to end the conflict.Since that time, discussions regarding a ceasefire or conclusion to the conflict have come to a halt.Bessent additionally addressed the Trump administration's Supreme Court petition to reverse a circuit court ruling that opposed the president's extensive tariff measures.""I am confident that we will win at the Supreme Court,"" the treasury secretary was quoted as saying.Also Read | The 50% misfire: How Trump made Russian oil cheaper for India - And Putin a winner",US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has called on the European Union to join America in adding pressure on Russia.

Georgia Hyundai plant raid: US-South Korea finalise deal for workers' release; here’s what’s happening,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/georgia-hyundai-plant-raid-us-south-korea-finalise-deal-for-workers-release-heres-whats-happening/articleshow/123746402.cms,"Screams, Chains, Panic: Inside ICE’s Biggest Worksite Raid; Hyundai Georgia Plant Turns 'War Zone'





South Korea struck a deal with the United States, on Sunday, securing the release of its nationals detained during an immigration raid at a Hyundai plant in Georgia.Presidential chief of staff, Kang Hoon-sik, declared that the two nations had completed negotiations and only administrative formalities were pending. He further added that Seoul would arrange a chartered flight to bring the workers back once those steps were finalised.According to foreign minister Cho Hyun, more than 300 South Koreans were among the 475 people taken into custody during Thursday’s operation.The raid was part of the Trump administration’s broader deportation drive, but stood out because of its scale and its focus on a major manufacturing project described by state leaders as Georgia’s largest economic development initiative.Footage released by US immigration and customs enforcement showed convoys of vehicles entering the site as federal agents ordered workers to assemble outside. Several were made to press their hands against a bus before being frisked and shackled at the wrists, ankles and waist.The operation targeted a plant still under construction, where Hyundai and LG Energy Solution are working together to produce batteries for electric vehicles.During the operation, several workers had attempted to flee. Some crawled into air ducts while others jumped into a sewage pond, only to be retrieved by agents using a boat.Homeland Security Investigations had earlier said that those taken into custody included people who had crossed the border illegally, overstayed visas, or breached visa waiver rules.After the detention, Cho Hyun said President Lee Jae Myung had ordered “all-out necessary measures” to support those affected.","More than 300 South Koreans were among the 475 people taken into custody during Thursday’s operation.

"Undersea cables cut in Red Sea: Internet disrupted across Asia, Middle East; India, Pakistan among affected",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/undersea-cables-cut-in-red-sea-internet-disrupted-across-asia-middle-east-india-pakistan-among-affected/articleshow/123744508.cms,"AI image





Internet services across parts of Asia and the Middle East faced disruptions after undersea cables in the Red Sea were cut, experts said on Sunday. While concerns were raised over possible sabotage amid ongoing conflict in the region, it was not immediately clear what caused the incident, according to the news agency Associated Press.Microsoft said on its status page that the Middle East “may experience increased latency due to undersea fiber cuts in the Red Sea,” though internet traffic outside the region was not affected.NetBlocks, which is a global watchdog monitoring internet access, reported “a series of subsea cable outages in the Red Sea” had degraded connectivity in several countries, including India and Pakistan.It identified failures to be impacting the South East Asia–Middle East–Western Europe 4 (SMW4) and the India-Middle East-Western Europe (IMEWE) cable systems near Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.The SMW4 is run by Tata Communications, part of India’s Tata Group, while IMEWE is managed by a consortium overseen by Alcatel-Lucent. Both firms did not immediately respond to requests for comment, as per the AP report.Pakistan Telecommunications Co. Ltd. confirmed the cuts in a statement on Saturday. In the UAE, users of state-owned Du and Etisalat networks also complained of slower speeds, though authorities there and in Saudi Arabia did not comment.In Kuwait, authorities also said the FALCON GCX cable running through the Red Sea had been cut, causing disruptions in the small, oil-rich nation. GCX did not respond to a request for comment.Submarine cables, a key part of global internet infrastructure, are vulnerable to ship anchors or deliberate attacks. Repairs typically take weeks, requiring specialised vessels to locate and fix the damage.The disruption comes as Yemen’s Houthi rebels continue attacks linked to the Israel-Hamas war. While speculation has grown about their role in targeting subsea infrastructure, the group has denied previous responsibility.On Sunday, the Houthis’ al-Masirah satellite channel acknowledged reports of the outages, citing NetBlocks, but did not claim involvement. Yemen’s internationally recognised government, however, alleged the cable cuts “cannot be isolated from the series of direct attacks carried out by the Houthi militia.”Yemen's information minister Moammar al-Eryani was quoted as saying by AFP, “What is happening today in the Red Sea should serve as a wake-up call for the international community, which must take a firm stance to stop these escalating threats and protect the digital infrastructure that serves as the lifeline of the modern world.”From late 2023 through 2024, the Houthis struck over 100 ships in the Red Sea using missiles and drones, sinking four and killing at least eight mariners. The Iranian-backed rebels sank two more vessels in July, killing at least four on board, with others believed to be held by the group.Their campaign, which they frame as pressure on Israel over Gaza, has drawn retaliatory airstrikes. Israel has responded with strikes, including one that killed top leaders within the movement.Earlier this year, Yemen’s internationally recognised government accused the Houthis of planning to attack cables, though the group denied it. Several cables were cut, possibly by a ship attacked by the Houthis dragging its anchor, but the rebels again rejected responsibility.The Houthis briefly paused their attacks during a ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war but later became the target of a weekslong US air campaign ordered by President Donald Trump before he declared a truce with the rebels.","Internet services across parts of Asia and the Middle East faced disruptions after undersea cables in the Red Sea were cut.

"US jobs data: Unemployment hits four-year high at 4.3%; only 22,000 new jobs in August",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-jobs-data-unemployment-hits-four-year-high-at-4-3-only-22000-new-jobs-in-august/articleshow/123732652.cms,"Representative AI image





Employment data for August revealed significant weakening in US job market conditions, with unemployment climbing to 4.3%, marking a nearly four-year peak.This development strengthens expectations for a Federal Reserve interest rate reduction this month, according to Reuters.The Friday employment report further disclosed June's first job losses in four and a half years, raising concerns about economic stagnation. Job creation has declined since April, with analysts attributing this to governmental policies, including import tariffs, stricter immigration controls, and substantial public sector redundancies.""The economy is skating as close to the edge of recession as you can get,"" said Christopher Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS. ""Companies are clearly hunkering down and refusing to hire and the blame can be traced back to Washington's economic agenda. The only medicine to help is a rate cut from the Fed,"" he added, quoted by Reuters.August recorded only 22,000 new nonfarm positions, following July's revised increase of 79,000, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.Data revisions indicated June experienced a 13,000 job decrease, contrary to the previously reported 14,000 increase, marking the first decline since December 2020.These adjustments validated concerns raised by substantial downward revisions to May and June figures in July's report, leading to the dismissal of BLS Commissioner Erika McEntarfer. The president alleged data manipulation without providing evidence.Analysts attribute these revisions to the BLS ""birth-and-death"" calculation method, which estimates employment changes from business openings and closures.The president maintained his criticism of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell regarding interest rates, though avoiding direct comments on the employment figures.""Jerome 'Too Late' Powell should have lowered rates long ago. As usual, he's 'Too Late!'"" the president had posted on Truth Social.The situation reflects broader economic uncertainties, with import duties raising average tariff rates to levels unseen since 1934, whilst recent court rulings questioning their legality have created additional business uncertainty.Notably, August’s initial payroll numbers may be revised higher, as seasonal factors often cause a weak bias in the first estimate. Nonetheless, employment growth has slowed considerably, averaging 29,000 jobs per month over the last three months, compared with 82,000 in the same period in 2024. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) is expected to publish preliminary revisions to employment levels for the 12 months through March, which could reinforce the trend of slower job growth.Based on the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW) data, economists estimate employment could be revised down by as much as 800,000. The QCEW draws from employer reports to state unemployment insurance programs.Healthcare added the most jobs in August, with payrolls rising by 31,000, though this was below the 12-month average of 42,000. Social assistance jobs grew by 16,000, while federal government payrolls fell by 15,000, bringing total federal employment down 97,000 since January amid spending cuts. More declines are expected in October when employees on severance pay drop off the rolls.Manufacturing lost jobs for the fourth consecutive month, highlighting the impact of tariffs. Other sectors—including wholesale trade, information, financial activities, construction, and professional and business services—also shed positions.Wages remain a bright spot, supporting economic expansion for now. Average hourly earnings rose 0.3% in August, matching July, while annual wage growth slowed slightly to 3.7% from 3.9%. However, declining hours worked raise concerns about overall economic growth.“Today’s news probably raises more questions about the growth outlook than about the Fed outlook,” said Michael Feroli, chief economist at J.P. Morgan. “Private hours worked appear to be contracting at about a 0.5% annual rate this quarter. We remain cautious about growth prospects next quarter.”Financial markets are pricing in a quarter-percentage-point rate cut at the Fed’s September 16-17 meeting, with two more expected before the end of 2025. The central bank has maintained its benchmark overnight interest rate at 4.25%-4.50% since December. Stocks traded lower on Wall Street, the dollar weakened against a basket of currencies, and U.S. Treasury yields fell.The unemployment rate edged up from 4.2% in July to 4.3%, the highest since October 2021. The household survey indicated 436,000 people entered the labor force, but only 288,000 found employment. Economists noted that the termination of temporary legal status for hundreds of thousands of immigrants and longer bouts of unemployment contributed to weaker labor force outcomes.The average duration of joblessness increased to 24.5 weeks, the longest since April 2022. “The labor market has hit stall speed,” said Nicole Cervi, economist at Wells Fargo, highlighting the slowdown and persistent challenges in job growth.","Unemployment climbs to 4.3%, marking a nearly four-year peak.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.","Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor ( CEA ) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September.

How India's GDP has been growing

What SBI report said on savings and investment

Incremental capital output ratio

NEW DELHI: India's gross domestic product (GDP) data for the third quarter (October-December 2022) received a word of caution from the former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan In an interview with news agency PTI, Rajan that India is ""dangerously close"" to the Hindu rate of growth in view of subdued private sector investment, high interest rates and slowing global growth.India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying"".However, a report released by the State Bank of India (SBI) economists on Tuesday dismissed arguments that India is dangerously close to Hindu rate of growth saying such statements are ""ill-conceived, biased and premature"".The term 'Hindu growth rate' was coined by late economist Raj Krishna in 1978 to describe the slow growth in the country.It basically refers to the low pace of economic growth rates during 1950s to 1980s. During this period, the Indian economy averaged 3.5%.A former lecturer at the Delhi School of Economics (DSE), Krishna noted that only if the rate of growth is persistently slow and accompanied by low per-capita GDP, then it will be known as Hindu rate of growth but it has to factor in population growth as well.Before economic reforms of 1991, India's economic growth remained stagnant and low, while per capita income averaged around 1.3%. Krishna termed this low growth situation to be a result of socialist policies of state control and import substitution.However, the economic situation changed when liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation (LPG) reforms came into effect in the year 1991, at a time when India faced balance of payment crisis.Over the years, many economists have strongly opposed the idea of 'Hindu growth rate' and the term never had universal acceptance.The Indian economy plunged into its very first technical recession in FY21 due to the impact of Covid-19 pandemic and the related nationwide lockdowns. GDP shrunk by an unprecedented 23.8% in the first quarter of the financial year 2020-21. However, due to spurt in economic activities in the subsequent quarters, the GDP decline started to narrow.However, if we look at the period before Covid-19 as well, India's growth curve shows a declining trend.From 8.26% in FY17, GDP growth plunged to 3.74% in FY20. Shutdown of economic activities in FY21 in wake of Covid-19 only made matters worse.As lockdowns started to ease and business activities resumed, India's GDP also started rising. In Q1 of FY22, growth jumped to 20.1% mainly on account of low base effect. By the fourth quarter of FY22, growth came down to 4.10%.Similarly, the new financial year 2022-23 brought fresh economic challenges in the form of Russia-Ukraine war that impacted almost all major economies of the world, slowed the pace of growth, pushed inflation to record highs.As a result, the central banks of all advanced economies spurred into action and opted for monetary policy tightening to curb the soaring inflation.With persistently rising interest rates, India's economy grew by 4.4% in Q3 of FY23, as the Centre revised upwards GDP growth for previous year to 9.10% from 8.7% earlier.The report weighed recent GDP numbers against the available data on savings and investments for the past decade and highlighted some interesting points.""Quarterly growth numbers are noisy and should be best avoided for any serious interpretation (on an average, India's GDP growth has witnessed Rs 2 lakh crore upward revision for the 3 year ended FY23),"" the report said.Gross capital formation (GCF) by the government touched a high of 11.8% in 2021-22, up from 10.7% in 2020-21.""This also had a domino effect on private sector investment that jumped from 10 per cent to 10.8% over the same period,"" it said.In fact, Ecowrap added that the trends in GCF to gross output ratio or the plough back of funds for creation of fresh capacity shows that for public administration the ratio attained fresh peak in 2021-22 owing to the emphasis on capital expenditure in recent budgets.At the aggregate level, gross capital formation is supposed to have crossed 32% in 2022-23, the highest level since 2018-19.According to the report, in 2021-22, gross savings have risen to 30% from 29% in 2020-21.""The ratio is supposed to have crossed 31 per cent in 2022-23, the highest since 2018-19. The household savings increased sharply during the pandemic period on account of sharp accretion in financial savings such as deposits,"" said the report by SBI's Economic Research Department.While household financial savings have since then moderated from 15.4% in 2020-21 to 11.1% in 2022-23, savings in physical assets have grown sharply to 11.8% in 2021-22 from 10.7% in 2020-21.The report further analysed Incremental Capital Output ratio (ICOR) -- which measures additional units of capital (investment) needed to produce additional units of output. It said that the ratio has been improving.""ICOR which was 7.5 in FY 12 is now only 3.5 in FY22. Clearly, only half of capital is now needed for next unit of output,"" the report noted.Such reducing ICOR in the current years reflects a relatively increasing efficiency of capital and shows that the economy is on a sound footing, the report said.""From that point of view, future GDP growth rates even at 7% could still mean a decent number by any standards!,"" it added.","India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%. Raghuram Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying""","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-98483158,imgsize-65724,width-400,resizemode-4/98483158.jpg"

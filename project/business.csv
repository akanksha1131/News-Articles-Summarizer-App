Air India Express fleet expansion: First line-fit Boeing 737-8 MAX arrives in Capital Monday; marks Tata-era milestone,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/air-india-express-fleet-expansion-first-line-fit-boeing-737-8-max-arrives-in-capital-monday-marks-tata-era-milestone/articleshow/126207087.cms,"Representative image

Air India Express will get its first line fit Boeing 737-8 MAX aircraft on Monday, December 29 in New Delhi. It's the first brand-new plane made specifically for Air India since Tata Group took over from the government in 2022. The aircraft, registered as VT-RNT, pays tribute to Ratan Naval Tata with a special livery design, according to Flight Radar, quoted by PTI.The plane is part of Air India's massive fleet expansion. The group ordered 470 planes in February 2023, added another 100 orders in December 2024. Until now, Air India Group has only been using white tail aircraft - planes originally made for other airlines but redirected to them due to global supply chain issues.Air India Express marked notable growth this year. The airline's Managing Director, Aloke Singh, recently told staff that they've crossed the 100-aircraft milestone. In 2025, they added 25 new planes - including 14 Boeing MAXs, 4 A321 neos, 4 A320 neos, and 3 A320 ceos. They also received their first retrofitted Boeing B737 MAX and welcomed their first Airbus A321 neo, which was part of 16 A320 family aircraft transferred from Air India.","Air India Express will get its first line fit Boeing 737-8 MAX aircraft on Monday.

Chilean firms partner to form giant company to exploit lithium,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/chilean-firms-partner-to-form-giant-company-to-exploit-lithium/articleshow/126211526.cms,"Chile's state-owned Codelco, the world's leading copper producer, and private miner SQM, which features Chinese capital, announced Saturday the creation of a giant company to exploit lithium, a lightweight metal used in batteries for electric vehicles.The South American country is the world's second-largest producer of lithium, a key component of EVs and other clean technologies, and has about 40 percent of the world's lithium reserves.The partnership between the firms will allow them to jointly ramp up the exploitation of lithium in the Atacama salt flat region of northern Chile.The public-private partnership will be called Nova Andino Litio SpA, said Codelco, which described the deal as ""one of the most significant in the history of Chilean business.""The Chinese firm Tianqi holds a 22 percent stake in SQM.The new company ""will carry out lithium exploration, extraction, production, and commercialization activities in the Atacama salt flat until 2060,"" Codelco said in a statement. Chilean regulators authorized the alliance earlier in December.The agreement was approved by more than 20 national and international regulatory bodies, including in China, Brazil, Saudi Arabia, and the European Union.Chile was the last of the countries to clear the deal.Last month, China gave the green light to the planned partnership between Codelco and SQM.The partnership aims to restore Chile's leadership in lithium production, a title it lost to Australia nearly a decade ago.The new company aims to increase production by about 300,000 tons per year in the Atacama salt flat.In 2022, Chile produced 243,100 tons of the so-called white gold.""This joint venture makes it possible to plan the development of the Atacama salt flat,"" and for the benefit of global markets, said Ricardo Ramos, CEO of SQM, one of the world's leading lithium producers.The partnership is part of the National Lithium Strategy announced by the leftist government of Gabriel Boric in 2023, aimed at reclaiming Chile's global leadership in lithium production.According to Codelco, with this agreement the Chilean state will receive around 70 percent of the operating margin generated by the new production between 2025 and 2030, and starting in 2031, 85 percent of that margin.Lithium accounted for three percent of Chile's exports in 2024.","Chile is the world's second-largest producer of lithium, a key component of EVs and other clean technologies.

Brace for fog chaos at airports on Sunday: IndiGo cancels flights; Air India issues travel advisory,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/brace-for-fog-chaos-at-airports-on-sunday-indigo-cancels-flights-air-india-issues-travel-advisory/articleshow/126206757.cms,"ANI file photo

NEW DELHI: IndiGo has cancelled 13 flights scheduled for Sunday, citing forecasted bad weather across several airports, with two services affected by operational reasons. The cancellations impact routes to and from major cities, including Chandigarh, Mumbai, Ahmedabad, Hyderabad, Amritsar, Bengaluru, Delhi, Gaya, Kolkata, Chennai, Jaipur and Pune.The airlines on Saturday had cancelled 57 flights across their network at several airports, citing weather conditions.IndiGo, which had cancelled thousands of flights earlier this month due to stricter norms on pilots’ duty periods and rest, has continued to cancel some services for more than a week, citing “bad weather” as the reason.Meanwhile, Air India issued a travel advisory citing dense fog and reduced visibility across parts of northern India. The airline said the conditions may disrupt flight schedules on Sunday morning in cities like Chandigarh, Amritsar and Varanasi.""In the event of unexpected delays, diversions, or cancellations, please rest assured that our ground colleagues remain available to assist you.If you are flying with us tomorrow, we recommend checking your flight status here before heading to the airport and allowing extra time for your journey,"" the airlines said through a post on X.The aviation regulator DGCA has designated December 10 to February 10 as the official fog window for this winter, requiring airlines to follow special low-visibility operating norms, as cited by PTI.Under the DGCA’s CAT-IIIB guidelines, airlines must roster pilots trained for low-visibility operations and deploy aircraft equipped to operate in such conditions.Category III systems enable aircraft to land in dense fog, with CAT-III A allowing landings at a runway visual range of 200 metres, and CAT-III B permitting operations at under 50 metres.Under its original winter schedule, IndiGo had approval to operate 15,014 domestic flights per week, or about 2,144 flights a day, around six per cent higher than its summer 2025 schedule.However, after widespread disruptions earlier this month, including the cancellation of about 1,600 flights in a single day due to stricter pilot rest norms, the government cut the airline’s domestic capacity by 10 per cent, or 214 flights daily.As a result, IndiGo is currently limited to operating no more than 1,930 domestic flights per day during the winter season.A four-member DGCA panel is probing IndiGo’s recent operational issues and has already questioned the airline’s CEO, Pieter Elbers, and COO, Isidre Porqueras. The panel’s report is expected later this week.The DGCA on Friday evening submitted its report on the circumstances leading to IndiGo’s operational disruptions to the civil aviation ministry, officials said. The report is expected to examine why the airline’s domestic network was severely affected while international operations remained largely unaffected.A ministry spokesperson said the inquiry committee, headed by DGCA Joint Director General Sanjay K. Bramhane, had submitted a confidential report. Aviation minister Ram Mohan Naidu has told Parliament that the government will take “exemplary” action against IndiGo once the probe is concluded.","IndiGo has cancelled 13 flights scheduled for Sunday, citing forecasted bad weather across several airports.

NEW DELHI: Following the recent IndiGo fiasco, the whip is now being cracked on Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) officials responsible for ensuring such schedule collapse did not take place.The in-charge of flight standards directorate (FSD) - which, among other roles, looks after flight duty time limitation of pilots and airlines' flight operations - has been removed. Roles of some other key officials are also under the scanner, and ""more action is on the cards"", sources said.An additional director, who was holding additional charge as director of FSD, has been relieved of the same and will now only look after the ""airspace & air navigation service standards"" wing. This officer has also been facing allegations of rising through regulatory ranks on the basis of a fake degree.After the crisis earlier this month - when an operational collapse affected 5,000 flights - four flight operations inspectors working in DGCA were sent back to their parent airline. However, they were largely seen as scapegoats.How much these actions help remains to be seen, as both aviation industry insiders and top govt officials admit that DGCA is in need of a complete revamp.Instead of an under-staffed body under the thumb of the aviation ministry, many reports on DGCA's restructuring have called for an independent, autonomous and self-funded civil aviation authority on the lines of those in the US and Europe.""Throughout 2025, we have witnessed how out of depth our aviation agencies are. Whether it is the controversial probe of AI 171 crash, which has put a question mark on Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau or the crash of Delhi air traffic control, which did not show Airports Authority of India in a good light due to its delayed ATC modernisation programme,... each agency has a lot to answer for,"" said aviation industry old-timers.","The in-charge of flight standards directorate (FSD) has been removed.

Silver at record highs! Futures price hits Rs 2.42 lakh/kg; driven by global supply chain hit fears and Fed rate-cut hopes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/silver-at-record-highs-futures-price-hits-rs-2-42-lakh-per-kg-driven-by-possible-global-supply-concerns-and-fed-rate-cut-expectations/articleshow/126206250.cms,"Representative AI image

Silver prices surged over 15 per cent last week to reach Rs 2.42 lakh per kg in the nation's futures market. This rally was driven by strong industrial demand, expected US interest rate cuts in 2026, and concerns about supply disruptions. The price surge was mirrored globally, with silver reaching an all-time high of $79.70 per ounce.On the Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX), silver futures for March 2026 delivery jumped by Rs 18,210 in a single day. The white metal has shown incredible growth this year, rising by nearly 175% from its December 2024 levels.""Silver is no longer trading merely as a precious metal like gold. Its indispensable role in high-performance technology, combined with shrinking above-ground stocks and non-negotiable industrial demand, is reshaping its fundamentals,"" said Rahul Kalantri, VP, Commodities, Mehta Equities, as quoted by PTI.The surge is largely attributed to China's new export restrictions on silver, set to begin January 1, according to commodities experts. As the world's largest consumer of silver for solar panels, electronics, and electric vehicles, China's policy change is expected to hit global supply chains.Jigar Trivedi, senior research analyst at Reliance Securities, predicted that Comex silver prices could reach $100 per ounce next year, based on growing industrial demand outpacing supply.The precious metal has shown consistent growth in global markets too. Silver prices increased by $47.95, or 164 per cent, from $29.24 per ounce recorded at the end of 2024. Other factors that contributed to silver's remarkable performance are strong industrial consumption, steady ETF inflows, and increased investment interest.","Silver prices surged over 15 per cent last week to reach Rs 2.42 lakh per kg in the nation's futures market.

NEW DELHI: Popular quick e-commerce firm Zepto filed its preliminary papers on Saturday with Securities Exchange Board of India (Sebi), aiming to raise Rs 11,000 crore via initial public offering (IPO).The company, founded by Stanford university dropouts, is using a confidential route for its stock market debut planned for next year, according to officials cited by PTI . This move could make Zepto one of India's youngest listed startups, joining competitors Zomato and Swiggy on the exchanges.The company has submitted ""the pre-filed draft red herring prospectus with Sebi and the stock exchanges...in relation to the proposed initial public offering of its equity shares on the main-board of the stock exchanges,"" as per the officials quoted.The confidential pre-filing approach is becoming popular among companies wanting more flexibility in their IPO planning. It helps them respond better to market conditions before going public. Zepto's move follows successful listings of its rivals - Zomato (with Blinkit) in 2021 and Swiggy (with Instamart) in November 2024.The company has strong financial backing from big investors. It's currently valued at $7 billion and has raised $1.8 billion (about Rs 16,000 crore) since it started.In October , it got $450 million from CalPERS. The company became a unicorn in August 2023 after raising $200 million, reaching a $1.4 billion valuation.Started by Aadit Palicha and Kaivalya Vohra, Zepto has grown quickly with its 10-minute grocery delivery service across major Indian cities. By September this year, the company was running over 900 dark stores. It spent Rs 1,000-1,100 crore in operations and achieved gross sales of $3 billion (about Rs 26,000 crore).","The company, founded by Stanford university dropouts, is using a confidential route for its stock market debut planned for next year.

India's GST Big Reset Is Logical, Transparent, And Not About Trump Tariffs: Says Sanjeev Sanyal

NEW DELHI: India needs to be comfortable with people and companies going bankrupt, as continuous insolvency and bankruptcy are essential for building a risk-taking and dynamic economy, said Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister (EAC-PM) member Sanjeev Sanyal.In an interview with ANI, Sanyal said a healthy economic system must allow for ""continuous churn"", where old companies shut down, and new ones emerge to take their place. He stressed that constant change is necessary for long-term economic strength.Sanyal said allowing large companies to fail is sometimes unavoidable. Referring to 2017, he recalled that Indian banks were under severe stress, following which the government allowed some of the country's biggest companies to go bankrupt.""This did not make the corporate sector weaker. In fact, it came back much stronger after the cleanup,"" he told ANI.Using the airline sector as an example, Sanyal said the closure of Jet Airways created space for other airlines to expand. He added that companies that fail to follow rules or meet standards should be allowed to shut down.""We should allow continuous churn,"" he said.In his interview with ANI, Sanyal also said that success should not be viewed negatively and that people should not resent companies that perform well.However, he added that regulators must intervene if large companies misuse their power or distort competition.The discussion also touched on welfare policies. Sanyal said he is ""very, very uncomfortable with freebies"" but supports the idea of a safety net for people who take risks.He said a risk-taking culture exists at every level of society, from a billionaire starting a large business to a person opening a small kirana shop. Since risks can fail, a safety net is necessary to support those who ""fall off at the edges.Sanyal highlighted the growing strength of India's financial markets, saying Mumbai has now become a more important centre for raising capital than London or Singapore. He said innovation is driven mainly by risk-taking capital such as equity and venture funding.He expressed hope that over the next 25 years, the top 20 companies in India's stock market will be completely different from those today.Comparing global trends, Sanyal said countries like the United States and China remain strong because their leading companies change frequently. In contrast, he said Europe's largest companies have remained largely unchanged for nearly 30 years, which he described as ""stagnation"".Sanyal added that bankruptcy ""should not be held as a moral failure"" but should be seen as a natural part of a society willing to take risks and grow.","India needs to be comfortable with people and companies going bankrupt, says Sanjeev Sanyal.

The appeal is clear: discounted prices.

As the curtain begins to fall in 2025, India's economic story resists easy labels. Was it the year the country was squeezed by global trade wars and tariffs? Or was it a rare ""Goldilocks"" moment, marked by strong growth, low inflation and ample policy room to support the economy?The answer lies somewhere in between.The year-end economic review of India reads as a story of resilience, reform and recalibration. From record stock market highs to a weakening rupee, from expanding trade ties to sudden tariff shocks, the year revealed how India’s economic fortunes are increasingly shaped by forces far beyond its borders.India's economic ascent continued to capture global attention in 2025. Already the world’s fourth-largest economy, the country is firmly on track to become the third-largest by 2030, with GDP projected at $6628.0 billion, according to the latest IMF World Economic Outlook report.The headline moment came with the release of second-quarter GDP data for FY 2025-26. Real Gross Domestic Product expanded by a stunning 8.2% during the July–September period — a sharp acceleration from the 5.6% growth recorded in the same quarter last year.The print exceeded market estimates and even surpassed the Reserve Bank of India’s projections, marking a six-quarter high.Combined with a strong 7.8% expansion in the April–June quarter, the economy grew by around 8% in the first half of the financial year, reinforcing India’s position as the fastest-growing major economy globally.Economists expect growth to remain resilient in the December quarter, supported by stronger consumption following GST rationalisation.""Now we can comfortably say full year growth will be 7% or north of 7%,"" Chief Economic Adviser V Anantha Nageswaran said after the data release.The National Statistics Office data cemented India’s position as one of the fastest-growing major economy in the world, even as global growth slowed and tariffs on Indian exports to the US intensified.In its official statement, the government highlighted ""Real GDP, adjusted for inflation, rose 8.2% in Q2 FY26, compared with 5.6% in Q2 FY25. Growth in Q1 FY26 stood at 7.8%, up from 6.5% a year earlier. Nominal GDP expanded by 8.7% in Q2, with all major sectors contributing to the expansion. The primary sector grew 3.1% year-on-year, while the secondary and tertiary sectors posted strong growth of 8.1% and 9.2%, respectively. ""Prime Minister Narendra Modi described the numbers as validation of policy continuity and reform-led growth. ""The 8.2% GDP growth in Q2 of 2025-26 is very encouraging. It reflects the impact of our pro-growth policies and reforms. It also reflects the hard work and enterprise of our people. Our govt will continue to advance reforms and strengthen the Ease of Living for every citizen,"" he posted on X.If growth was the headline, inflation was the surprise.The Reserve Bank of India has described the current macroeconomic environment as a ""rare goldilocks"" phase, marked by strong growth alongside low inflation.India achieved a historic milestone in October 2025 when retail inflation fell to just 0.25%, the lowest year-on-year print in the current CPI series, according to government data. The print marked a sharp 119-basis-point fall from September, reflecting a dramatic easing in price pressures.Inflation edged up modestly to 0.71% in November, a 46-basis-point increase from October, but remained comfortably below the Reserve Bank of India’s 4% target, underscoring a prolonged period of price stability.The cooling was driven largely by deflation in food prices. CPI inflation stayed benign through 2025-26, prompting the RBI to project average inflation at around 2% for the fiscal year, the lower bound of its tolerance range.The combination of inflation and a growth-oriented monetary stance has created space for further policy support, with expectations building around a complementary demand boost in the Union Budget 2026-27.With inflation firmly under control, the central bank moved decisively to support growth. The RBI cut the repo rate during FY 2025-26, lowering it from 6.25% to 5.25%.The Monetary Policy Committee cut the repo rate by a cumulative 125 basis points during the calendar year 2025, bringing it down to 5.25%, while revising its inflation forecast to around 2% and nudging up full-year growth projections to about 7.3%.Including earlier actions, the RBI has now lowered rates by a total of 125 basis points since February 2025, marking its most aggressive easing cycle since 2019.One of the most consequential reforms of the year came in September with the launch of GST 2.0. The overhaul simplified India’s indirect tax architecture streamlined into two slabs — 5% and 18%, replacing the earlier four-rate system of 5%, 12%, 18% and 28%. Most essentials, household items and daily-use goods now attract 5% GST or are exempt.Luxury and sin goods, including pan masala, tobacco, aerated drinks, high-end cars, yachts and private aircraft will be taxed at 40%, ensuring progressivity while safeguarding revenues.Life insurance premiums were made GST-free. Household goods, packaged foods, medicines, consumer durables, automobiles and farm equipment all became cheaper.GST on farm machinery, irrigation equipment and bio-pesticides has been slashed to 5%, reducing input costs and encouraging productivity and sustainable farming practices.The reform eased compliance, reduced costs, boosted festive demand and reinforced domestic manufacturing, delivering relief at both the consumer and enterprise level.The Union Budget added another boost, delivering sweeping income tax relief under the new tax regime. The headline announcement was zero income tax on annual income up to Rs 12 lakh.For salaried individuals, the nil-tax threshold effectively rises to Rs 12.75 lakh, after accounting for the standard deduction of Rs 75,000, offering additional relief to middle-income earners.Slab rates were reworked to ease the burden on middle-income earners, significantly improving disposable incomes. Together, tax cuts, GST rationalisation, record-low inflation, robust GDP growth and accommodative monetary policy have created a supportive economic environment.These factors are expected to lift consumer spending, improve corporate profitability and sustain investment momentum. While currency volatility remains a risk to watch, the broader macro trend points to positive market sentiment and scope for sustained economic expansion.As the RBI summed up, ""Economic activity during the first half of the financial year benefited from income tax and goods and services tax (GST) rationalisation, softer crude oil prices, front-loading of government capital expenditure, and facilitative monetary and financial conditions supported by benign inflation.""India’s equity markets delivered a mixed performance in 2025, touching record highs and lows during the year, later ending on a softer note as foreign selling intensified amid global uncertainty, geopolitical tensions and shifting trade dynamics.Strong consumer demand, steady government spending and ongoing structural reforms helped markets remain resilient for much of the year.Markets began cautiously, weighed down by global growth concerns, elevated interest rates in advanced economies and trade tensions. Still, benchmarks opened the year on a positive footing. On January 2, the BSE Sensex stood at 78,507.41 while the Nifty 50 was at 23,742.90, supported by buying in frontline stocks.A recovery was following however, global volatility spiked in April after US President Donald Trump, in his second term, announced sweeping new tariffs on April 2, dubbed ""Liberation Day"" triggering a sell-off across global markets.Volatility remained in the final months due to foreign portfolio outflows, rupee pressure and uncertainty around global monetary policy and geopolitics. Nifty 50 touched an all-time high of 26,326 on December 1, ending the year with gains of about 10.2%, while BSE Sensex also hit its highest-ever closing level of 86,159.02, reflecting steady gains and improving market breadth through much of the year.However, momentum faded toward the close. In the final sessions, benchmarks declined dragged down by continued foreign investor selling and a lack of strong domestic triggers. The Nifty 50 closed at 26,042.30, down 0.38%, while the Sensex fell 367 points, or 0.43%, to 85,041.45, after touching an intraday low of 84,937.82.Overall, the Indian markets showed a neutral-to-negative note in 2025.Even as protectionism rose, India pressed ahead with trade diplomacy. India stepped up its trade diplomacy in 2025, concluding key free trade agreements and reviving stalled negotiations as it sought to diversify export markets amid rising global protectionism and tariff barriers.India concluded a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with New Zealand on December 22, paving the way for duty-free entry of all Indian exports into the New Zealand market and a planned investment inflow of $20 billion over the next 15 years. PM Modi and New Zealand Prime Minister Christopher Luxon announced the deal via social media, with both sides aiming to double bilateral trade within five years.According to the Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI), the pact strengthens India’s access to a high-income, rules-based Pacific market, while offering New Zealand deeper entry into one of the world’s fastest-growing major economies amid global trade uncertainty.The India–Oman Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) delivers near-complete duty-free access for Indian exports and opens opportunities across labour-intensive manufacturing, services and skilled workforce mobility.The deal marks a major expansion of India’s economic footprint in the Gulf region. Gulzar Didwania, Partner at Deloitte India, described the Oman CEPA and New Zealand FTA as ""watershed moments"" for India’s export-led growth strategy.""The India–Oman CEPA delivers zero-duty access on nearly 98% of tariff lines, covering textiles, engineering goods, medical devices, pharmaceuticals and automobiles. Similarly, the India–New Zealand FTA removes tariffs on 100% of India’s exports, opening the NZ market widely and potentially doubling trade over five years,"" he told TOI.The India–UK Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) offers near-total duty-free access for Indian exports, with significant upside for labour-intensive sectors.India and Israel have been negotiating an FTA since 2010, completing ten rounds covering 280 tariff lines. Talks stalled due to differences over services market access, particularly the temporary movement of Indian IT and skilled professionals. Negotiations gained fresh momentum in November 2025, when both sides signed the Terms of Reference, formally reviving discussions.India has already signed trade agreements with Sri Lanka, Bhutan, Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia, South Korea, Japan, Australia, the UAE and Mauritius. It is also part of:Despite strong domestic growth, 2025 exposed some of India’s economic vulnerabilities on the global front. The year was marked by rising trade tensions, currency pressure and heavy foreign capital outflows.The Indian rupee remained volatile in December, slipping to a record low near Rs 91 per US dollar on December 16, weighed down by strong dollar demand and sustained foreign portfolio outflows.The rupee recovered some ground the following day, strengthening by 55 paise to close at Rs 90.38 on December 17. A further late-week rebound saw the currency rise from nearly Rs 91 to Rs 89.27 on December 19, though pressure soon returned.On December 26, the rupee closed at Rs 89.86 per dollar, dragged down by falling domestic equities, continued foreign fund outflows and higher crude oil prices.Despite intermittent recoveries, the rupee has emerged as one of the worst-performing emerging market currencies this year, hurt by US tariffs on Indian exports and weak portfolio inflows. The pace of depreciation has been a key concern.After breaching the Rs 90 per dollar level, the rupee slipped past Rs 91 within just 13 days. In less than a year, it has fallen from around Rs 85 to Rs 90, underscoring the speed of the decline.According to State Bank of India’s Ecowrap report, the rupee is expected to stabilise and recover next year, even as near-term volatility persists.Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) remained persistent sellers of Indian equities throughout 2025, extending a selling trend that began in October 2024. As a result, 2025 has turned into the worst year on record for foreign equity flows into India.FIIs are set to close the year with a record-breaking exodus from Indian stock markets, marking the steepest annual net outflows ever witnessed in India’s capital markets.As of December 27, FIIs had sold equities worth Rs 22,130 crore through stock exchanges. This took cumulative equity selling in calendar year 2025 to Rs 2,31,990 crore. Investments via the primary market stood at Rs 73,583 crore, bringing net FII outflows for the year to Rs 1,58,407 crore, the highest annual net selling by FIIs since they began investing in India.According to Morgan Stanley, FII positioning in Indian equities is now close to cyclical lows. However, the brokerage cautioned that a sustained return of foreign inflows would depend on stronger growth momentum, relatively weaker equity performance in other markets, or higher corporate issuance levels.While domestic fundamentals remain relatively strong, currency volatility and foreign outflows continue to pose near-term challenges for Indian markets.US President Donald Trump has often spoken warmly of his personal relationship with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, repeatedly describing him as a ""great friend."" However, Washington’s trade actions toward India in 2025 told a sharply different story.On August 1, the US imposed a 25% tariff on Indian goods, doubling it to 50% by August 27, alongside an additional ""penalty"" linked to India’s energy ties with Russia. The move marked one of the most aggressive trade actions taken against India in recent years.Trump accused India of maintaining some of the world’s highest tariffs and what he called ""obnoxious"" non-monetary trade barriers. He also criticised India’s continued purchases of Russian oil, saying this undermined global efforts to pressure Moscow over the war in Ukraine.His rhetoric escalated in July, when he said,""I don’t care what India does with Russia. They can take their dead economies down together, for all I care."" New Delhi responded firmly stressing that the country remained firmly on track to become the world’s third-largest economy.The United States remains India’s largest export destination, but trade ties faced strain after the Trump administration imposed punitive tariffs of up to 50% on Indian goods.While discussions continue, a final agreement remains elusive. A recent visit by a US delegation to New Delhi failed to deliver a breakthrough, even as Prime Minister Modi and President Donald Trump have described bilateral engagement as positive.The US is pushing for greater exports of energy and agricultural products, while India has drawn a firm red line on opening its farm sector. Officials now believe a deal could be signed by March.The US administration has repeatedly cited its widening trade deficit with India as a key concern, arguing that India maintains relatively high tariffs on American goods and imposes market-access restrictions. ""We have a massive trade deficit with India,"" Trump said shortly before the initial 25% tariffs came into effect.According to analysts, 2026 could be the first full year in which countries begin grappling with the real-world consequences of a tariff-heavy global trade system, with implications for investment flows, economic growth, inflation, interest rates and currencies.Trade negotiations have increasingly become entangled with US immigration policy, particularly around the H-1B visa programme, a critical channel for India’s services exports. The US raised the H-1B visa fee to $100,000, up from a previous range of $2,000–$5,000, sharply increasing hiring costs for employers.From December 15, the US State Department also introduced enhanced screening and vetting, including scrutiny of applicants’ social media profiles, for both H-1B and dependent H-4 visas.This shift could significantly disadvantage entry-level professionals and recent international graduates, many of whom are Indian, raising fresh concerns about India’s largest and fastest-growing services export channel to the US.One of the most unexpected jolts to India’s trade outlook in 2025 came not from a global superpower, but from Mexico.In December, Mexico announced a blanket tariff hike of up to 50% on imports from non-free trade agreement (FTA) countries, a move aimed at blocking Chinese trans-shipments from entering the United States duty-free. The decision had immediate and significant implications for Indian exporters.Under the measure, import duties ranging from 5% to 50% will apply to around 1,463 product categories from countries that do not have an FTA with Mexico, including India. The revised tariffs will come into effect from January 1, 2026, though the detailed product list has yet to be officially published.According to estimates by the Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI), the impact on Indian trade could be severe. ""Nearly 75% of India’s $5.75 billion exports to Mexico will be affected as tariffs jump from 0-15% to around 35%,"" the think-tank said.For Indian exporters, particularly in sectors such as automobiles, textiles, engineering goods and consumer products, the decision threatens to undo years of market-building efforts in Latin America.India and Mexico are currently preparing to begin discussions on a bilateral free trade agreement, with formal negotiation parameters expected to be finalised shortly. Analysts believe such an agreement could help insulate Indian exporters from the tariff shock.India and Russia share a long-standing relationship, with economic ties dating back to the Soviet era. In the decades since, bilateral trade and investment have steadily expanded, with cooperation spanning energy, defence, pharmaceuticals and information technology.In the post-Soviet era, India–Russia trade rose from $1.4 billion in 1995 to a record $68.7 billion in FY 2024–25. Indian firms have invested in Russia’s oil and gas, pharmaceutical and IT sectors, while Russian companies have put money into India’s energy, infrastructure and manufacturing industries.Yet behind the headline numbers lies a growing imbalance that threatens to complicate the partnership.The India–Russia energy corridor has emerged as a defining feature of bilateral trade—especially since the outbreak of the Ukraine war and the imposition of Western sanctions on Moscow.In FY 2024–25, India’s imports from Russia stood at roughly $63.8 billion, driven overwhelmingly by crude oil and petroleum products. In contrast, India’s exports to Russia were only about $4.9 billion, leaving a massive trade gap.India’s dependence on Russian crude has remained high despite Western sanctions. In November 2025, India imported 1.77 million barrels per day (bpd) of Russian oil, marking a 3.4% increase over October.Estimates suggest that imports in December 2025 could reach as much as 1.5 million bpd, supported by strong volumes exceeding 1.2 million bpd earlier in the month.Russian oil has remained attractive due to aggressive pricing by non-sanctioned producers. Indian refiners—both public and private—have continued to capitalise on these discounts.Imports from Russia surged from $5.94 billion in 2020 to $64.24 billion in 2024, with crude oil now forming the largest share of goods flowing from Russia to India.The bilateral trade agenda gained further momentum during President Putin’s December visit to India, which reinforced energy and strategic cooperation while reaffirming the ambitious $100 billion trade target by 2030.On December 6, India and Russia vowed to scale up bilateral trade to $100 billion by the end of the decade. PM Modi also said both countries were ""actively working"" towards the early conclusion of a Free Trade Agreement with the Eurasian Economic Union, which includes Russia, Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan.However, the very factors that propelled India–Russia trade growth are now introducing new complications. Western sanctions are steadily reshaping India’s oil trade, according to a report by Rubix Data Sciences, reducing dependence on discounted Russian crude and redirecting energy flows towards the United States and the United Arab Emirates.The effects have been particularly visible in exports.In hindsight, 2025 will be remembered neither as a flawless ""Goldilocks year nor as one derailed by tariffs.""

What is NUDGE campaign?

ITR filing & Refunds: Why are taxpayers getting ‘nudges’?

What kind of exemptions and deductions are likely under scrutiny?

What should taxpayers do if they get a ‘nudge’ from tax authorities?

Amarpal Chadha shares a checklist:

Verify Deductions and Exemptions: Check all deductions and exemptions claimed in the income-tax return and ensure adequate documentation exists to substantiate each claim

Check all deductions and exemptions claimed in the income-tax return and ensure adequate documentation exists to substantiate each claim Identify Discrepancies: Compare the return filed with Form 16, bank statements, investment proofs, and other records to spot any discrepancies.

ITR filing FY 2024-25 (AY 2025-26): The Income Tax Department is stepping up scrutiny for tax returns and income tax refund claims and many taxpayers are getting alerts to check their exemption and deduction claims. The last date to file income tax returns for FY 2024-25 was pushed to September 15, 2025 this year since the tax department took time to release forms and update the portal. However, the last date to file an updated or belated return for the current assessment year remains December 31, 2025.Several taxpayers are also facing delays in their returns and refunds being processed. Ahead of the important deadline, the Income Tax Department has issued a clarification on why some taxpayers are getting alerts to review their ITRs.The Income Tax Department has said that in the ongoing financial year 2025–26, over 21 lakh taxpayers have already updated their ITRs for AYs 2021–22 to 2024–25 and paid more than ₹2,500 crore in taxes. Also, over 15 lakh ITRs have been revised for the current assessment year.In a press release, the Income Tax Department has said that some taxpayers have claimed ‘ineligible’ refunds - through the deductions and exemptions route.This has led to their income being underreported.“Under the risk management framework, and through the use of advanced data analytics, cases for Assessment Year (AY) 2025–26 have been identified,” the Income Tax Department said.The tax department on its part is ‘nudging’ taxpayers to update their tax returns in case there is some discrepancy in the deductions and exemptions.Identified taxpayers are being sent SMS and email under the government’s “Non-intrusive Usage of Data to Guide and Enable (NUDGE)” campaign. The aim is to encourage these taxpayers to correct errors in tax return filing, ahead of the December 31, 2025 deadline.“This initiative reflects a trust-first approach to tax administration, under which taxpayers are provided an opportunity to review their Income-tax Returns (ITRs) and voluntarily correct any ineligible claims, wherever required,” the tax department said.“The campaign leverages data analytics and technology to enable a transparent, non-intrusive, and taxpayer-centric compliance environment, with an emphasis on guidance and voluntary compliance,” the department adds.The tax department has advised the concerned taxpayers to “review their ITRs, verify the correctness of their deduction and exemption claims, and revise their returns, if required, within the prescribed time by 31 December 2025, so as to avoid further enquiries in the matter.”Amarpal Chadha, Tax Partner at EY India explains that the NUDGE campaign is an initiative of the Income Tax Department aimed at encouraging taxpayers to voluntarily review deduction or exemption claims that have been identified as potentially ineligible through data analytics.The Department is also leveraging global information-exchange frameworks such as the Automatic Exchange of Information (AEOI), Common Reporting Standards (CRS), and the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) to identify possible discrepancies in foreign asset reporting, Chadha told TOI.Under the tax department’s initiative, taxpayers may receive an email or SMS explaining the reason for the communication and advising them to verify the accuracy of deductions or exemptions claimed, as well as the correctness of foreign asset disclosures. Where a taxpayer believes that corrective action is required, a revised return may be filed on or before December 31, 2025, which is the deadline for filing updated income tax returns for FY 2024-25Tanu Gupta, Partner, Mainstay Tax Advisors LLP has a clear message: In principle, all those exemptions and deductions which are not genuine are likely to come under scrutiny.“Even those deductions and exemptions which are inconsistent with the income tax department's records/information/data, may also come under scrutiny. The most sought-after deduction/exemption currently includes ""Donation to Political Parties"", ""House Rent Allowance"" to name a few,” she told TOI.According to Amarpal Chadha, any deduction that is claimed for donations to political parties where an incorrect or invalid PAN of the donee has been provided may come under the Income Tax Department’s scrutiny.The tax department has said that there are also cases where the taxpayers have given incorrect or invalid PAN details. Other cases pertain to the extent of deductions and exemptions that are being claimed by the taxpayers.“In addition, any deduction or exemption claimed in the income-tax return over and above what is reflected in Form 16 such as HRA exemption, exemptions under the Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (DTAA), gratuity exemption etc. are also under tax department’s radar,” he told TOI.Tanu Gupta recommends that for all the claims including exemptions and deductions, the taxpayer should always keep in handy the following documents: receipts / invoices of the payments for which exemption / deduction is claimed, bank statement evidencing such payment through proper banking channels, receipts from the recipient to corroborate with such payments.These are broad guidelines for the documents which the taxpayer should anyway keep on files for a good financial housekeeping, she says.Is there a need for panic? No, says Tanu Gupta. “Instead, the taxpayer needs to revisit their claims of exemptions and deductions in the return and take action accordingly viz file the revised return if needed. As the name suggests, the abbreviation and the complete name of it (Non-Intrusive Usage of Data to Guide and Enable), it is to facilitate the taxpayer to file compliant tax returns voluntarily, with correct, justified and genuine claims of deductions/exemptions,” she tells TOI.“There are cases where the taxpayers have received the communication from the department, although they believe that they do not have any inconsistency for the claims made in the return. They only need to see if they have all supporting documents for such payments to submit to the tax authorities when asked for,” explains Tanu Gupta, adding that wherever such exemptions / deductions are not authentic, the taxpayer needs to immediately revise the tax return by reversing such claims in the returns; and pay due income tax along with interest.If any claim or reporting needs correction, file a revised return within the prescribed timeline currently on or before December 31, 2025, he says.“However, if the taxpayer believes that the exemptions or deductions claimed are accurate and valid, they may wait for further communication from the Income Tax Department,” he adds.It is important to restate here that taxpayers do not have to worry where their tax claims are genuine.The Income Tax Department has clarified that taxpayers whose claims are genuine and correctly made in accordance with law are not required to take any further action.“It is clarified that taxpayers who do not avail of this opportunity may still file an updated return from 1 January 2026, as permitted under law, subject to payment of additional tax liability,” it has said.","Identified taxpayers are being sent SMS and email under the government’s ‘Non- intrusive Usage of Data to Guide and Enable (NUDGE)’ campaign. The aim is to encourage these taxpayers to correct errors in tax return filing, ahead of the December 31, 2025 deadline.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126159165,imgsize-48186,width-400,resizemode-4/income-tax-return.jpg"
China's industry profits stumble: Profits in November fall 13.1%; biggest decline in over a year,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/china-industries-stumble-profits-in-november-fall-13-1-per-cent-biggest-decline-in-over-a-year/articleshow/126206691.cms,"Representative AI image

China's industrial firms saw their profits drop by 13.1 per cent in November, from last year, marking the steepest decline in over a year. This fall came despite strong exports, putting focus on country's ongoing economic struggles and increasing pressure for more government support. The National Bureau of Statistics released these figures on Saturday, as quoted by Reuters.The decline was worse than October's 5.5 per cent. This trend comes as China faces persistent factory-gate deflation and weak consumer spending. For the first 11 months of the year, industrial profits barely grew, showing just a 0.1% increase compared to the previous year's 1.9% growth.""The profit numbers show a broader cooling in economic activity in the fourth quarter, mainly due to the drag from soft domestic demand,"" said Xu Tianchen, senior economist at the Economist Intelligence Unit. However, Xu remained cautiously optimistic about future profits, suggesting companies might find more opportunities overseas.Despite this, there were some industries that managed to register gains. The automobile industry posted a 7.5 per cent rise in profitability, while the high tech industry posted a 10 per cent rise. A massive decline of 47.3 percent in profitability was seen in the coal mine industry.An estimate by the think tank, Rhodium Group, quoted by Reuters, indicated a growth of 2.5 per cent to 3 per cent in the Chinese economy for the year, which is approximately half the officially-hinted growth.Chinese policymakers are now promising more support. At a recent meeting, they pledged to maintain ""proactive"" fiscal policies next year. The government has also committed to improving employment, boosting consumption, stabilizing prices, and helping the struggling property market.NBS Chief Statistician Yu Weining noted that industrial firms still need stronger support, especially given the uncertain global environment and ongoing changes in growth drivers. The data covers companies earning at least 20 million yuan ($2.85 million) in annual revenue from their main operations.","China's industrial firms saw their profits drop by 13.1 per cent in November, from last year, marking the steepest decline in over a year.

The US Wall Street is hoping to mark a strong finish for the year, amid recent highs. The S&P 500 ended at a record high on Wednesday, ahead of the Christmas holiday , being just around 1 per cent short of the 7,000 mark for the first time.The S&P 500 is on track for its eighth straight month of gains, a trend not seen since 2017-2018. The benchmark index has grown nearly 18 per cent this year, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq is up 22 per cent.Investors remain optimistic, with the US stock market showing signs of continued growth despite earlier concerns over technology sector weakness, according to a Reuters report.""Momentum is certainly on the side of the bulls,"" said Paul Nolte, senior wealth adviser at Murphy & Sylvest Wealth Management, as quoted by Reuters. ""Barring any exogenous event, the path of least resistance for stocks, I think, is higher,"" he added.The Federal Reserve's recent actions are keeping investors on edge. The Fed cut rates by 75 basis points over its last three meetings of 2025, bringing them to 3.50 per cent-3.75 per cent. Markets are eagerly awaiting the minutes from the December meeting, due next Tuesday.Additionally, an interesting shift is happening in the market.While tech stocks have struggled lately, dropping over 3 per cent since November, other sectors are doing well. Key sectors to mark significant gains include- Finance, transport, healthcare, and small-cap stocks.Anthony Saglimbene from Ameriprise Financial sees this as a positive sign, saying, ""There are more investors that are buying in to the narrative that the economy is on pretty solid footing right now,"" he explained. ""And it has weathered a lot of potential roadblocks this year that might not be such roadblocks next year,"" he added.Investors are also watching for President Donald Trump's nomination for the next Fed chair, as Jerome Powell's term ends in May 2026. This decision could impact market movements in the coming week.","The US Wall Street is hoping to mark a strong finish for the year, amid recent highs.

China Sets New Record in Superconducting Maglev Propulsion

Chinese scientists have achieved a milestone in magnetic levitation technology. Researchers at China's National University of Defence Technology successfully propelled a one-tonne vehicle to 700 kilometers per hour in just two seconds on a 400-meter test track, setting a new world record for superconducting electric maglev systems.The test, shown in footage making rounds on social media and Chinese news outlets, displayed a chassis-like vehicle zooming across the track leaving a misty trail. This demonstrates significant progress in both extreme acceleration capabilities and high-power control systems.""It resolves core technical challenges including ultra-high-speed electromagnetic propulsion, electric suspension guidance, transient high-power energy storage inversion, and high-field superconducting magnets,"" CCTV stated, as reported by South China Morning Post (SCMP).This breakthrough could revolutionise various transportation methods, from hyperloop systems to aerospace launches.The same team had previously reached 648 km/h on the same track in January. Their decade-long research puts China at the forefront of global maglev technology, marking significant progress since developing their first manned maglev train thirty years ago.Professor Li Jie, who led Beijing's first commercial maglev subway line, believes this success will speed up China's ultra-high-speed maglev transport development.In 2020, CRRC Qingdao Sifang had tested a 600km/h prototype. In the meantime, Southwest Jiaotong University developed a high-temperature superconducting maglev system in Chengdu targeting speeds over 600km/h.The latest development includes a collaboration between the Third Research Academy of China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation and North University of China. The built a 2-kilometer experimental line in Datong for testing maglev trains in low-vacuum pipelines, with an aim for eventual speeds of 1,000 km/h.This technology has the potential to transform city-to-city travel through vacuum-sealed tubes and potentially revolutionise rocket launches by reducing fuel consumption during takeoff. It also offers new possibilities for testing high-speed flight equipment through ground-based simulations.",Chinese scientists have achieved a milestone in magnetic levitation technology. Researchers propelled a one-tonne vehicle to 700 kilometers per hour in just two seconds on a 400-meter test track. The same team had previously reached 648 km/h on the same track in January.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126204696,imgsize-722623,width-400,resizemode-4/article-66.jpg"

Silver price jumped nearly 9% to trade at a record high of $78.65, on Friday (local time) according to the New York Commodity Exchange. With this surge, the white metal has outpaced gold this year, with prices up more than 158% over the past 12 months.The rally extended across the broader metals market. Spot gold climbed to an all-time high of $4,549.71 an ounce, while platinum touched a record $2,454.12 after gaining around 10%, according to Reuters. Spot palladium also recorded the sharpest move of the session, rising more than 14% to $1,924.03 an ounce.Gold, meanwhile, edged up just over 1.2% to reach a high of $4,562.70.Silver rose on the back of tight supply, rising industrial demand and expectations of more rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. Analysts have also pointed to a mix of lower interest rates, growing use of silver in AI data centres, supply constraints and uncertainty around tariffs as key drivers behind the white metal’s surge this year.“Prospect of lower US interest rates is still supporting demand for gold and silver, lifting both metals to new record highs,” UBS analyst Giovanni Staunovo told Reuters. In early trading, silver crossed the $75-per-ounce level for the first time, as both precious and industrial metals rallied amid economic and political uncertainty.Gold is on course for its strongest annual performance since 1979, supported by Federal Reserve policy easing, geopolitical risks, central bank buying, higher ETF holdings and ongoing de-dollarisation. Silver has benefited from structural supply deficits, its designation as a US critical mineral and strong industrial demand, far outpacing gold’s nearly 72% rise.Platinum and palladium, widely used in automotive catalytic converters, have also advanced sharply amid tight supply conditions, tariff uncertainty and a shift in investment demand away from gold. Platinum has gained about 165% this year, while palladium is up more than 90% year to date.“Momentum-driven and speculative players have been powering the rally in gold and silver since early December, with thin year-end liquidity, expectations of prolonged US rate cuts, a weaker dollar and a flare-up in geopolitical risks combining to push precious metals to fresh record highs,” Kelvin Wong, senior market analyst at OANDA, told Reuters.“Looking ahead into the first half of 2026, gold could move towards the $5,000 level, while silver has the potential to reach around $90,” Wong further said.Traders are currently pricing in two US rate cuts next year, a support that continues to lift non-yielding assets such as gold and silver. At the same time, market sentiment has also been influenced by geopolitical developments, including US moves related to Venezuelan oil and strikes against Islamic State militants in northwest Nigeria following attacks on Christian communities.","Silver price jumped nearly 9% to trade at a record high of $78.65, on Friday (local time) With this surge, the white metal has outpaced gold this year, with prices up more than 158% over the past 12 months.

'Year of tariff consequences': Global trade in 2026 — another rough patch ahead?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/year-of-tariff-consequences-global-trade-in-2026-another-rough-patch-ahead/articleshow/126200153.cms,"'India Got Out Of The Gates Faster Than Most Nations', Says US Expert As Trade Deal Talks Nears End

2026 — The year of tariff consequences

The year 2025, reshaped global commerce in ways not seen for decades, moving into another uncertain phase, as pressures on growth and stability are expected to intensify. So will 2026 be another turbulent patch for global trade?Global merchandise trade managed to stay resilient through 2025, even as US President Donald Trump pushed ahead with higher tariffs that effectively raised barriers around the world’s largest economy. According to data cited by shipping industry veteran John McCown, global container volumes increased 2.1% in October compared with the same month last year, according to Bloomberg.Overall figures, however, revealed sharp regional divergences.While inbound container volumes into the US fell by 8%, imports into Africa, the Middle East, Latin America and India recorded strong growth, pointing to a rebalancing of global trade flows.“World container supply chains have already begun to adapt and reconfigure trading patterns,” McCown wrote in a research note cited by Bloomberg. He compared the current slowdown with last year’s rally, noting that after a 15.2% rise in US container imports in 2024, “to say that the annual total for 2025 will be in diametric contrast is an understatement.”McCown attributed much of this shift to Trump’s trade policies.In a LinkedIn post, he argued that if 2025 marked the peak of tariff announcements, the impact would be felt more fully in the year ahead. He wrote that if 2025 was the year of the tariff, 2026 will be the year of tariff consequences.Trade analysts said that several fault lines are already visible as 2026 draws closer. One of the most closely watched developments will be the review of the United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement, the North American trade pact that came into force in 2020. The agreement is due for reassessment just six years after implementation, an unusually short timeframe for such a deal.US trade representative Jamieson Greer told lawmakers this month that the process has drawn heavy engagement, with more than 1,500 responses submitted during the public consultation. “Many stakeholders expressed support for the USMCA and many explicitly called for the agreement to be extended,” Greer said, as quoted by Bloomberg.“At the same time, virtually all stakeholders also called for some sort of improvement to the agreement.” Any attempt to revise the deal is expected to be contentious, as gains for one member could come at the expense of another. Industries in both Canada and Mexico are already under pressure from US import duties, while diplomatic relations remain strained. Tensions worsened in October after Trump halted trade talks with Canada in response to anti-tariff advertisements featuring Ronald Reagan.At the same time, global shipping faces the prospect of fresh disruption. Industry experts warn that two developments, both seemingly positive, could strain supply chains.The first is a possible large-scale return of cargo vessels to the Red Sea, after shipping lines were diverted around southern Africa for nearly two years due to Houthi attacks. With hostilities easing since the Gaza peace plan took effect in October, the route has become safer. French carriers CMA CGM SA and Denmark’s A.P. Moller-Maersk A/S have already resumed limited transits through the area.But a full return to the Red Sea and the Suez Canal could overwhelm existing infrastructure. Lars Jensen, chief executive of consultancy Vespucci Maritime, warned during a Flexport webinar in November that it would “flood the market with a lot more capacity” and lead to “massive port congestion issues in Europe.”A second risk could emerge from stronger demand. Jensen said that if the US economy accelerates in 2026 as Trump administration officials predict, driven by lower interest rates and increased investment, a wave of inventory restocking could exceed the shipping sector’s ability.Uncertainty also surrounds the durability of the Trump administration’s recent trade agreements. While the White House has highlighted deals struck with several major economies in 2025, these arrangements lack the enforcement mechanisms typical of traditional trade pacts. Most include only short-term commitments, and the truce with China extends for just one year, leaving unresolved the US’s most imbalanced trading relationship.Concerns that these agreements could unravel have been reinforced by recent events. Indonesia has resisted US trade demands since Washington announced what it called a “landmark trade deal” in July, fearing constraints on its independence, with a revised agreement now expected in late January. China has raised objections with Malaysia and Cambodia over their trade deals with the US, warning against actions that undermine Beijing’s interests. The UK has also encountered fresh complications, Bloomberg reported.Greer said last week that difficult negotiations with the European Union and India are likely to continue into the new year. His office also warned of possible retaliation against the EU, citing what Washington views as excessive regulation of American technology firms.Adding to the uncertainty is a pending US Supreme Court decision on the legality of Trump’s reciprocal tariffs, the sweeping duties imposed on most major trading partners. A ruling against the administration could raise questions over whether importers would be refunded tariffs already paid.Kevin Hassett, director of the National Economic Council, told CBS’s Face the Nation that even in such a scenario, refunds were unlikely. It would be “pretty unlikely that they’re going to call for widespread refunds, because it would be an administrative problem,” he said.Betting markets currently assign roughly a 75% probability to Trump losing the case, a result that could push the administration to rely on alternative legal powers to maintain tariffs.","Global merchandise trade managed to stay resilient through 2025, even as US President Donald Trump pushed ahead with higher tariffs.

The Japanese government on Friday approved a record budget for the upcoming fiscal year, to pay for everything from bigger defence spending to ballooning social security costs as inflation persists.The 122.3-trillion-yen ($782 billion) budget for the fiscal year from April 2026 will include some nine trillion yen for defence spending, as Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi aims to accelerate Tokyo's sweeping upgrade of its military in the face of worsening relations with China.The defence ministry said in a briefing document that ""Japan faces the most severe and complex security environment since the end of the war,"" stressing the need to ""fundamentally strengthen"" its defence capabilities.At the core of its request is 100 billion yen for the so-called SHIELD coastal defence system, which would marshal drones to block any invasion by foreign troops.Japan is hoping that SHIELD -- Synchronised, Hybrid, Integrated and Enhanced Littoral Defence -- will be completed by March 2028, with no details yet on which part of Japan's coastline it will be linked to.The 122-trillion-yen figure compares with the 115 trillion yen sought for the current fiscal year to March, which was also a record.The expanding budget comes as the market worries about Takaichi's big spending policies adding to Japan's public debts.Japan already has the biggest ratio of debt to gross domestic product (GDP) among major economies, projected to reach 232.7 percent this year, according to the International Monetary Fund.Earlier this month parliament approved a massive extra budget, to pay for a 21.3-trillion-yen stimulus announced a month earlier.The market has reacted by driving down the value of the yen while the benchmark yield rose for Japanese government bonds.Some observers have drawn comparisons to the UK's 2022 bond market turmoil under then-premier Liz Truss.Takaichi has advocated big government spending to spur economic growth.""What Japan needs right now is not the undermining of our strength as a nation through excessive austerity fiscal policies, but rather the bolstering of our national strength through proactive fiscal policies,"" she told a press conference last week.In an interview Tuesday with the influential Nikkei business daily, Takaichi stressed her commitment to Tokyo's fiscal health, rejecting any ""irresponsible bond issuance or tax cuts.""The current size of the budget is unlikely to shock the bond market, Takahide Kiuchi, executive economist at Nomura Research Institute, wrote in a note ahead of Friday.But an increase to around 125 trillion yen or more, he said, would cause the ""turmoil in the bond market, already in crisis mode, to deepen further"".Kiuchi noted that, under Takaichi, the extra budget quickly ballooned, reaching $18 trillion yen.""Financial markets are likely on high alert for a similar occurrence. Should the fall of the yen and bond prices further accelerate due to the size of the budget, it would increase worries about adverse effects on the economy and people's lives.""A weaker yen raises prices of imports for resource-poor Japan, which relies heavily on foreign food, energy and raw materials to power its economy.Takaichi came to power in October with a pledge to fight inflation after anger over rising prices. Another challenge facing the country is its ageing population, caused by chronically low birth rates and a cautious approach to immigration. The draft budget needs to be approved by parliament.",The 122.3-trillion-yen budget for the fiscal year from April 2026 will include some nine trillion yen for defence spending.

US investors may soon have access to a greater array of products tied to asset classes like private credit and crypto as the Trump administration and SEC push to open markets, a change that some investment advisors say puts too much onus on individuals to protect themselves.Both the White House and the Securities and Exchange Commission, under Chair Paul Atkins, have embraced offering investors more choice in order to tap into some asset classes that can offer high returns. Still, some financial advisors caution their clients, who typically invest in stocks and bonds, may not be able to fully comprehend the influx of new offerings already underway that market analysts expect to increase in 2026.“Something negative will happen, and people will say, wait, I didn’t realise the risk I was taking,” said Mark Stancato, a founder of VIP Wealth Advisors in Decatur, Georgia a registered investment advisor. He is concerned that investors may struggle to make informed decisions, particularly when evaluating their retirement assets.The SEC and the White House said they remain focused on investor protection.“Chairman Atkins is committed to ensuring the SEC maintains fair, orderly, and efficient markets while protecting everyday investors,” said Taylor Rogers, a White House spokeswoman, adding that the US remained the “best and most secure place” to invest.An SEC spokesperson said the agency is focused on ensuring investors have access to “robust information to make informed decisions” on all new products.(Reuters)","US investors may soon have access to a greater array of products tied to asset classes like private credit and crypto.

Ruble surges in 2025: Russian currency emerges as top performer against US dollar; why it's a headache for its war economy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/russian-currency-ruble-emerged-as-the-top-performing-major-currency-against-the-us-dollar/articleshow/126177645.cms,"Representative image

The Russian currency Ruble emerged as the top-performing major currency against the US dollar this year, surging 45% since January. This unexpected strength caught Russian officials off guard and poses challenges for the country's war-affected economy. The currency is now trading around 78 per dollar, similar to levels before Russia's Ukraine invasion, as reported by Economic Times.The surge comes from several factors. Russians are buying less foreign currency due to international sanctions. High interest rates have also made ruble investments more attractive to locals. The central bank kept rates very high from October last year until June this year, before reducing them by 5 points to 16 per cent.This strong performance has exceeded government expectations, which predicted an average rate of 91.2 per dollar for the year. The ruble has stayed strong despite lower oil prices and new sanctions from the US and Europe. This strength is actually causing problems by reducing the value of export earnings when converted to rubles.The Bank of Russia has been supporting the currency by selling foreign currency, particularly yuan and gold, from the National Wellbeing Fund.This is helping offset declining energy revenues, with oil and gas income dropping 22% in the first 11 months of 2023.The ruble's impressive performance puts it among the world's top five performing assets this year, alongside precious metals like platinum, silver, palladium, and gold. Central Bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina sees this strength as helpful in fighting inflation, noting that its positive effects on prices haven't yet peaked.","The currency is now trading around 78 per dollar, similar to levels before Russia's Ukraine invasion.

A negative cycle

What's next?

Turned to artificial intelligence (AI) to help you stand out during the job process, but got rejected in the first round? Or are you a hiring manager who relied on AI to frisk through applications to select the best candidate, but ended up with not what you quite envisioned?The answer lies in the approach itself. Relying on artificial intelliegnce for job application might be doing you more harm than good.The growing use of artificial intelligence in recruitment is reshaping how Americans search for work, just as the country’s labour market shows signs of slowing. From automated interviews to AI-written cover letters, technology is now a part of almost every stage of the hiring process. But is it working?In 2025, more than half of organisations surveyed by the Society for Human Resource Management reported using AI tools to recruit workers. At the same time, almost one-third of ChatGPT users turned to the OpenAI chatbot for help with job applications. Yet recent research indicates that candidates who rely on AI during the application process are actually less likely to be hired, even as employers struggle to cope with a flood of applications.“The ability (for companies) to select the best worker today may be worse due to AI,” Anais Galdin, a researcher at Dartmouth told CNN Business.Galdin and Jesse Silbert of Princeton University examined tens of thousands of cover letters submitted on Freelancer.com, a job listing platform and found that after the launch of ChatGPT in 2022, cover letters became longer and more polished. However, employers placed less importance on them, making it harder to distinguish strong candidates from the wider pool.As a result, hiring rates dropped, and so did average starting wages, CNN reported.“If we do nothing to make information flow better between workers and firms, then we might have an outcome that looks something like this,” Silbert said, referring to the study’s findings.As application volumes rise, companies are increasingly automating interviews as well.According to a survey by recruitment software firm Greenhouse conducted in October, 54% of US job seekers said they had taken part in an AI-led interview. While virtual interviews became common during the pandemic in 2020, many employers now use AI systems to conduct interviews, without necessarily removing subjectivity from hiring decisions.“Algorithms can copy and even magnify human biases,” said Djurre Holtrop, a researcher who studies the use of asynchronous video interviews, algorithms and large language models in hiring.“Every developer needs to be wary of that,” CNN cited the expert.Daniel Chait, chief executive of Greenhouse, said the growing use of AI by both applicants and employers has created a negative cycle. “Both sides are saying, ‘This is impossible, it’s not working, it’s getting worse,’” Chait told CNN.Despite these concerns, adoption of the technology continues with one estimate projecting that the market for recruitment technology will grow to $3.1 billion by the end of this year. At the same time, resistance is mounting from lawmakers, labour groups and workers worried about discrimination.Liz Shuler, president of the AFL-CIO labour union, described AI-driven hiring as “unacceptable”.“AI systems rob workers of opportunities they’re qualified for based on criteria as arbitrary as names, zip codes, or even how often they smile,” Shuler said in a statement to CNN.Several US states, including California, Colorado and Illinois, are introducing new laws and regulations aimed at setting standards for the use of AI in hiring. However, a recent executive order signed by US President Donald Trump raised questions about the future of state-level oversight. Samuel Mitchell, a Chicago-based employment lawyer, said the order does not “preempt” state law but adds to the “ongoing uncertainty” around regulation.He added that existing anti-discrimination laws still apply, even when companies use AI systems, and legal challenges are already emerging. In a case supported by the American Civil Liberties Union, a deaf woman is suing HireVue, an AI-powered recruitment company, alleging that an automated interview failed to meet legal accessibility standards. HireVue denied the claim, telling CNN that its technology reduces bias through a “foundation of validated behavioral science”.Even with these challenges, more and more AI is getting hiring access. New tools have made resume screening more sophisticated, potentially helping some candidates who may have been overlooked. But for those who value personal interaction, the shift has been unsettling.Jared Looper, an IT project manager in Salt Lake City, Utah, who previously worked as a recruiter, recently underwent an AI-led interview during his job search. He described the experience as “cold”, and said he initially hung up when contacted by the automated system.Looper said he worries about job seekers who have yet to adapt to a hiring environment where appealing to algorithms has become essential.“Some great people are going to be left behind.”","The growing use of artificial intelligence in recruitment is reshaping how Americans search for work.

US 30-Year Mortgage Rates Fall to 6.18%: Are Buyers Still Cautious?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-mortgage-rate-us-30-year-home-loan-rates-edge-down-to-6-18-affordability-concerns-keep-buyers-cautious/articleshow/126164122.cms,"The average interest rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage in the US edged slightly lower this week but continued to hover within a narrow range that has prevailed for nearly two months, offering only modest relief to homebuyers.The benchmark long-term mortgage rate slipped to 6.18% from 6.21% last week, mortgage buyer Freddie Mac said on Wednesday. A year ago, the average rate stood at 6.85%, according to data cited by the AP.Borrowing costs moved the other way for 15-year fixed-rate mortgages, which are commonly used by homeowners refinancing their loans. The average rate rose to 5.50% from 5.47% a week earlier, compared with 6% a year ago, Freddie Mac said.Mortgage rates are influenced by a range of factors, including the Federal Reserve’s interest-rate decisions and investor expectations around inflation and economic growth. They typically track the 10-year US Treasury yield, which lenders use as a benchmark when pricing home loans.The 10-year Treasury yield stood at 4.15% by midday Wednesday, slightly higher than last week’s 4.12%.Freddie Mac data show that the 30-year mortgage rate has remained largely stable since October 30, when it dipped to 6.17%, its lowest level in more than a year.Rates began easing in July amid expectations of Federal Reserve rate cuts, which started in September and continued this month.While the Fed does not directly set mortgage rates, cuts to short-term rates can signal easing inflation or slower growth, prompting investors to buy US government bonds. That can push down long-term Treasury yields and, in turn, mortgage rates. However, rate cuts do not always lead to lower mortgage borrowing costs.Housing market conditions have improved slightly compared with a year ago. Home listings have risen sharply, and many sellers have lowered asking prices as properties take longer to sell, according to Realtor.com data. Buyers who can pay cash or manage current mortgage rates are in a stronger position than last year.Even so, affordability remains a major hurdle, particularly for first-time buyers without home equity. Economic uncertainty and concerns about the job market are also keeping many prospective buyers on the sidelines.Sales of previously owned US homes rose in November from the previous month, but slowed compared with a year earlier for the first time since May, despite mortgage rates hovering near their lowest levels of the year. Over the first 11 months of the year, home sales were down 0.5% from the same period last year.","The benchmark long-term mortgage rate slipped to 6.18% from 6.21% last week.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran Udaan until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.Udaan built an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business still accounts for a very small part of India’s overall retail market but can balloon to $150 billion in sales and yield a 100% return on capital invested in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co. estimates published in the Mint newspaper.Bengaluru-based Udaan has also ventured into financing through its fintech unit which helps shopkeepers get working capital loans to buy inventory. That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says.

Space sector start-up Sisir Radar to develop SAR on L/P band SAR,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/space-sector-start-up-sisir-radar-to-develop-sar-on-l/p-band-sar/articleshow/104558111.cms,"CHENNAI: Space sector startup, Sisir Radar Private Ltd has hit success at the prestigious iDEX DefSpace Challenge with its projects for development of “L/P band Continuous Wave SAR (synthetic aperture radar) payload for LEO Small Satellites” and “Unfurlable, Electronically Steering Antenna for L/P band SAR payload” for Indian Air Force (IAF), said a top company official.The company is promoted by former Director at the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) Tapan Misra and the brains behind the Indian space agency’s RISAT series of SAR satellites as well as the Dual Frequency SAR on the Chandrayaan 2 orbiter that is currently circling the moon.""A grant of Rs 3 crore is also there for development of the products,"" Misra told IANS.Synthetic Aperture Radar or SAR is a special kind of imaging radar technology that can provide extremely accurate high resolution imagery of the terrain through clouds, smoke and dust even in pitch dark conditions. SAR imagery provides much higher resolution than other forms of remote sensing technology such as hyperspectral and multispectral. SAR is a critical technology for strategic reconnaissance and planning as well as for disaster management.According to Misra, winning the challenge in just over a year of floating the company is a major booster.He said L and P band SAR have an advantage over other frequencies (like X band) when it comes to penetration capabilities through rain, clouds, foliage and vegetation in a tropical country like India, and underground penetration capabilities in dry terrain.Continuing further, he said the L band SAR will provide 1 metre resolution, spotlight resolution in Stripmap mode. The current industry standard is 5-10 metre in L band. Misra said both the L and P band will operate simultaneously from a satellite borne SAR. Recently, Sisir Radar successfully developed and tested the world’s highest resolution L-Band SAR fitted on a drone. With 0.2 metre resolution, this is by far the highest L band SAR in the world, he said.","Space sector startup, Sisir Radar Private Ltd has hit success at the prestigious iDEX DefSpace Challenge.

Explainer: What is 'Hindu rate of growth' and why Raghuram Rajan's remarks may be 'premature',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/explainer-what-is-hindu-rate-of-growth-and-why-raghuram-rajans-remarks-may-be-premature/articleshow/98482598.cms,"What is meant by Hindu growth rate

How India's GDP has been growing

What SBI report said on savings and investment

Incremental capital output ratio

NEW DELHI: India's gross domestic product (GDP) data for the third quarter (October-December 2022) received a word of caution from the former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan In an interview with news agency PTI, Rajan that India is ""dangerously close"" to the Hindu rate of growth in view of subdued private sector investment, high interest rates and slowing global growth.India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying"".However, a report released by the State Bank of India (SBI) economists on Tuesday dismissed arguments that India is dangerously close to Hindu rate of growth saying such statements are ""ill-conceived, biased and premature"".The term 'Hindu growth rate' was coined by late economist Raj Krishna in 1978 to describe the slow growth in the country.It basically refers to the low pace of economic growth rates during 1950s to 1980s. During this period, the Indian economy averaged 3.5%.A former lecturer at the Delhi School of Economics (DSE), Krishna noted that only if the rate of growth is persistently slow and accompanied by low per-capita GDP, then it will be known as Hindu rate of growth but it has to factor in population growth as well.Before economic reforms of 1991, India's economic growth remained stagnant and low, while per capita income averaged around 1.3%.Krishna termed this low growth situation to be a result of socialist policies of state control and import substitution.However, the economic situation changed when liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation (LPG) reforms came into effect in the year 1991, at a time when India faced balance of payment crisis.Over the years, many economists have strongly opposed the idea of 'Hindu growth rate' and the term never had universal acceptance.The Indian economy plunged into its very first technical recession in FY21 due to the impact of Covid-19 pandemic and the related nationwide lockdowns. GDP shrunk by an unprecedented 23.8% in the first quarter of the financial year 2020-21. However, due to spurt in economic activities in the subsequent quarters, the GDP decline started to narrow.However, if we look at the period before Covid-19 as well, India's growth curve shows a declining trend.From 8.26% in FY17, GDP growth plunged to 3.74% in FY20. Shutdown of economic activities in FY21 in wake of Covid-19 only made matters worse.As lockdowns started to ease and business activities resumed, India's GDP also started rising. In Q1 of FY22, growth jumped to 20.1% mainly on account of low base effect. By the fourth quarter of FY22, growth came down to 4.10%.Similarly, the new financial year 2022-23 brought fresh economic challenges in the form of Russia-Ukraine war that impacted almost all major economies of the world, slowed the pace of growth, pushed inflation to record highs.As a result, the central banks of all advanced economies spurred into action and opted for monetary policy tightening to curb the soaring inflation.With persistently rising interest rates, India's economy grew by 4.4% in Q3 of FY23, as the Centre revised upwards GDP growth for previous year to 9.10% from 8.7% earlier.The report weighed recent GDP numbers against the available data on savings and investments for the past decade and highlighted some interesting points.""Quarterly growth numbers are noisy and should be best avoided for any serious interpretation (on an average, India's GDP growth has witnessed Rs 2 lakh crore upward revision for the 3 year ended FY23),"" the report said.Gross capital formation (GCF) by the government touched a high of 11.8% in 2021-22, up from 10.7% in 2020-21.""This also had a domino effect on private sector investment that jumped from 10 per cent to 10.8% over the same period,"" it said.In fact, Ecowrap added that the trends in GCF to gross output ratio or the plough back of funds for creation of fresh capacity shows that for public administration the ratio attained fresh peak in 2021-22 owing to the emphasis on capital expenditure in recent budgets.At the aggregate level, gross capital formation is supposed to have crossed 32% in 2022-23, the highest level since 2018-19.According to the report, in 2021-22, gross savings have risen to 30% from 29% in 2020-21.""The ratio is supposed to have crossed 31 per cent in 2022-23, the highest since 2018-19. The household savings increased sharply during the pandemic period on account of sharp accretion in financial savings such as deposits,"" said the report by SBI's Economic Research Department.While household financial savings have since then moderated from 15.4% in 2020-21 to 11.1% in 2022-23, savings in physical assets have grown sharply to 11.8% in 2021-22 from 10.7% in 2020-21.The report further analysed Incremental Capital Output ratio (ICOR) -- which measures additional units of capital (investment) needed to produce additional units of output. It said that the ratio has been improving.""ICOR which was 7.5 in FY 12 is now only 3.5 in FY22. Clearly, only half of capital is now needed for next unit of output,"" the report noted.Such reducing ICOR in the current years reflects a relatively increasing efficiency of capital and shows that the economy is on a sound footing, the report said.""From that point of view, future GDP growth rates even at 7% could still mean a decent number by any standards!,"" it added.","India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%. Raghuram Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying""","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-98483158,imgsize-65724,width-400,resizemode-4/98483158.jpg"

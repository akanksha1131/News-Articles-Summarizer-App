He urged banks to ensure that grievances are properly addressed and escalated to internal ombudsmen when necessary, highlighting the importance of robust redress mechanisms. ""We have come across instances of rejected grievances not being escalated to the internal ombudsman of banks. I would like to urge the boards and their customer service committees to closely look into these aspects to ensure that banks have a genuine commitment to customer centricity,"" he added.Das emphasised that banks must adopt a genuine customer-centric approach and move beyond profit-driven motives. ""Boards should give a close look at service charges and penalties when they are treated as avenues of profit or when forced bundling of products is done, or when disclosures to customers are non-transparent or selective. Ensuring fair lending practices and implementing robust grievance redress systems are critical to protecting customers' interests,"" Das said.The governor noted that issues like forced bundling of products and non-transparent service charges need immediate attention from the board-level committees.

‘Work-life balance is controversial but...’: What Wipro’s Rishad Premji has to say days after Narayana Murthy reiterates 70-hour work week,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/work-life-balance-is-controversial-but-what-wipros-rishad-premji-has-to-say-days-after-narayana-murthy-reiterates-70-hour-work-week/articleshow/115484494.cms,"Rishad Premji’s comments come days after Infosys founder Narayana Murthy reaffirmed his position supporting a 70-hour work-week.

Work-life balance has become a frequently discussed subject lately, with Wipro executive chairman Rishad Premji acknowledging its significance as ""incredibly important"" whilst recognising it as a ""controversial subject"". He maintains that corporate hybrid working arrangements benefit employees.Rishad Premji’s comments come days after Infosys founder NR Narayana Murthy reaffirmed his position supporting a 70-hour work-week and expressed concern about India's transition from six-day to five-day workweeks in 1986, whilst rejecting the notion of work-life balance.Post-Covid, whilst Indian IT services companies adopted hybrid working arrangements, organisations like TCS, Infosys and Wipro have increasingly requested office attendance. However, many firms maintain flexibility.Speaking at the Bengaluru Tech Summit 2024, the Wipro group promoter said, ""Work-life balance is incredibly important. I learned this very early on in my early days before Covid, which is work life is something that you have to define for yourself, organizations are never going to work at it for you. So you have to define what it means and draw boundaries.""Also Read | When Narayana Murthy touched Ratan Tata’s feet Premji noted that the understanding of work-life has evolved significantly. Previously, it centered on office arrival and departure times, whereas now it might involve considerations such as managing ""Instagram access at work.""""The concept of what it means is simply not ours, it is also the freedom of what I can do with my time while at work, but not working,"" Premji elaborated.Premji said, ""The one model that IT industry has adopted, and I think the government has been supportive of is a more hybrid model of work. It is a controversial subject. But we, as a company, have said, we won't be able to come three days a week, but we want you to have the flexibility of having two days on your work place. That certainly helps with the workforce.""Addressing employee mental health and work-life balance, Premji noted the positive development of companies openly discussing these previously taboo subjects, particularly following the 2020 pandemic.He highlighted Wipro's initiative to train managers in recognising signs and conducting open discussions sensitively with staff.

(AI image)

Gold Loan EMIs: Following RBI 's identification of gaps in gold loan disbursements by banks and lending institutions, the sector is looking to start monthly amortisation schemes. The regulated bodies may require borrowers to start interest and principal payments through EMIs immediately upon loan approval. Additionally, lenders are considering term loan alternatives for gold-backed lending.On September 30, the RBI highlighted irregularities in lending against gold ornaments and jewellery. The central bank discovered issues in loan sourcing, valuation, diligence procedures, end-use monitoring, auction transparency, LTV ratio oversight, and risk weight application. The practice of rolling over gold loans with partial payments was deemed inadequate.""The regulator's diktat is clear, it wants lenders to examine the payment capacity of borrowers and not solely rely on the collateral,"" a senior banking official told ET. ""It is also unhappy with allowing rollover of such loans with part payment, which could lead to some delinquencies when repayments come up. We are now structuring monthly payment options for gold loans.""Currently, gold loan providers offer bullet repayment options, allowing borrowers to settle the entire amount at tenure end without EMI commitments.Alternatively, borrowers can make flexible partial repayments when funds are available, settling the complete principal and interest before the loan matures.This directive follows substantial growth in gold loan portfolios across banks and NBFCs recently. Crisil reports that bank-issued retail loans against gold jewellery grew 37% between April and August, coinciding with rising gold prices. Gold-loan-focused NBFCs recorded 11% growth in assets under management in Q1 FY25.""The sector faces underlying challenges as the continuous build-up of leverage raises concerns about borrowers' ability to service debt, especially given limited visibility into their cash flows or for that matter the end use of funds,"" said Prakash Agarwal, partner at consulting firm Gefion Capital.""A potential correction in gold prices could pose significant risks, as declining collateral values might create refinancing challenges and strain repayment capacity. Lenders must remain vigilant, balancing growth with prudent risk management to mitigate potential vulnerabilities.""As of September 30, banks' jewellery loan disbursements reached Rs 1.4 lakh crore, showing 51% growth compared to 14.6% in the previous year.Recent quarters have seen substantial growth in gold loans, supported by increased gold prices enabling additional top-ups on existing collateral. Limited access to unsecured and microfinance loans drove more borrowers towards gold loans.

"JSW MG's Windsor SUV pips Tata, Mahindra EVs",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/jsw-mgs-windsor-suv-pips-tata-mahindra-evs/articleshow/115540911.cms,"NEW DELHI: Is battery rental model , which allows customers easier affordability by paying only for a car, with battery costs being paid as monthly EMIs, working for electric cars?JSW MG's Windsor, the first electric car to come with 'battery as a service' (BAAS) model, was the largest selling green car last month, pipping much-established and fancied models such as Tata Nexon, Tata Curvv, Mahindra XUV4OO as well as its own ZS SUV.As per numbers provided by industry analysts, the Windsor sold 3,116 units in Oct, against 1,593 units of Nexon, 1,542 units of the Curvv, 1,017 units of Tiago and Tigor, 915 units of Punch, and 602 units of the XUV4OO (all electric versions). While sale in a single month may not be a fully accurate barometer of measuring a model's success, the lead based on an innovative scheme does point towards a trend where customer comfort can be seen.The battery rental model, a novel concept introduced by JSW MG at Windsor's launch in Sept this year, allows customers to pay for the vehicle, but minus the battery cost, which is a substantial part in the cost of an electric. This means that a customer is not burdened with a hefty price tag right at the time of purchase of an electric vehicle and can pay for it over a period of time through easy EMIs (MG fixed Rs 3.5 per km running as monthly instalment for the battery).The only drawback here is that against paying a GST rate of 5% that has been fixed for EVs, the monthly EMI on battery usage will mean that GST will be higher, where it is seen as a service. With the battery rental model, JSW MG also gave out other benefits such as a 'lifetime battery warranty' to the first owner, and one-year free charging at public stations. MG also gave an assured 60% buyback value for the car after three years or 45,000 km of run in another comforting factor for customers, who may still have doubts about buying an electric car.Parth Jindal, director at JSW MG Motor India, said the battery rental model helped the company ""create disruption"" in EV market. ""This vehicle embodies our commitment to delivering innovative, futuristic and sustainable mobility solutions... Windsor is driving democratisation of electric mobility.""Satinder Singh Bajwa, chief commercial officer for JSW MG, said that not only the metros, but the offer was also received good response in smaller towns and cities. ""Nearly 50% of Windsor's sales came from smaller cities, including Tier II and III locations, showing a growing acceptance of electrics beyond major urban centers.""","JSW MG's Windsor is the first electric car to come with 'battery as a service' (BAAS) model.

""To achieve higher growth, countries in the Global South need to step up investment in physical and social infrastructure, leverage technology and innovations and carry out institutional reforms. All these require congenial public policies, including monetary policies, to be growth supportive, while maintaining balance with inflation.""According to Das, Global South countries have a significant share of low-income population, with large developmental needs. They are more vulnerable to supply shocks, requiring fiscal support, which puts further burden on their limited budgetary resources.

Railway Budget 2024 : The government has wavered little in its efforts to spur a modernisation of railways in the country, pivoting on technology, to support the country’s economic ambitions. In line with expectations, Union Budget 2024-25 set the capex for railways at a record Rs 2.65 lakh crore, marking yet another year of successive increase in outlay. That takes forward the past policies and the government’s vision, which have paved the way for modernisation of the transport behemoth.In earlier decades, the government had focused on laying tracks on new routes, electrification and incremental rolling stock capacity addition. That was the need of the hour back then and has helped set up the base for a larger transformation.For instance, the massive Dedicated Freight Corridor ( DFC ) as well as locomotive factories at Marhaura and Madhepura in Bihar were conceptualised over a decade ago and we are seeing their completion now.More recently, the focus has shifted to modernisation—of rolling stock and safety systems, among other aspects.This year, emphasis has also been laid on the railways’ crucial role in industrial development. Commodity-specific corridors have been planned in eastern India and impetus given to port connectivity. Vande Bharat and technology-led upgrades in rolling stock remain in focus. Safety has been prioritised through budgetary allocations for the anti-collision systemKavach . That said, there are other cogs in the wheel that demand attention from a long-term perspective.First, the target for the Operating Ratio, the crucial efficiency gauge, has been set at 98.22% for 2024-25, compared with 98.65% in 2023-24. This reflects an imminent need for operational transformation. An effective overhaul of the world’s fourth-largest rail network will take many years and thus we need to start focusing on improving efficiency and reducing costs now.DFC is almost entirely operational and will be complete over the next few months. To ensure the project achieves its twin goals of reducing logistics costs and enhancing freight efficiency, railways need to attract more cargo on the corridor. This will help increase the rail coefficient and make the railways’ approach more market-oriented, which will in turn aid future corridors.A revamp of railway stations is on track, with sufficient funds dedicated to this end. But even though new coaches and wagons are increasingly being added to meet footfalls, the stations and passenger trains themselves remain synonymous with chaos.Just as safety, comfort and convenience have been prioritised, there is a need for solutions to address the capacity and demand challenges. As a first step, the government could target development of new stations and setting up of new coach production units.As a leading freight mover, Indian Railways carried a record 1,588 MT cargo in fiscal 2024, up from 1,095 MT in fiscal 2015. It accounts for 26% of the cargo moved in the country—by no means an easy feat. The railways aims to take this volume to 3,000 MT by 2030, which would require a 11% CAGR against the around 4.2% witnessed over the last 10 years. As per a report by TERI and Shakti Foundation, from carrying about 62% of freight traffic in 1990-91, Indian Railways’ share has declined to ~27% in 2014-15. This has been due to the expanding road network, cost competitiveness over railways, and door-to-door service. Thus, commencing the cycle of increasing the rail share again is commendable.DFCs, a high-capacity track network, high-power locomotives and improvement in wagon designs have set the ball rolling for larger capacity, faster freight trains that deliver better efficiency.Yet, achieving exponential growth is a tall ask given the current dynamics. Possibly, similar challenges might apply to other goals the railways might have for 2047.To be fair, despite its scale and complexity, Indian Railways has been able to achieve diverse developments at commendable speed.But the track ahead is long and it is time to start discussing the reinvention of the institutional set-up.Indian Railways sees substantial private sector involvement in the form of vendors and contractors. Policymakers could start mulling extreme options such as parallel privately-owned and operated railway infrastructure, coupled with centralised planning and an evolved role for the railways. This will need a robust policy framework from the Government of India.The time is perhaps also ripe to bring user charge and asset monetisation-driven segments for passengers as well as cargo to the discussion table. Globally, the separation of infrastructure and operations in railways has delivered mixed results, for example in the United Kingdom. The model should be analysed and revisited to understand its potential relevance in the Indian context.The key would be to retrace our steps and align our long-term goals to identify not just incremental changes but also ways to explore bold and path-breaking alternatives that put Indian Railways on a smooth track and bring it up to speed.","Union Budget 2024-25 set the capex for railways at a record Rs 2.65 lakh crore. In earlier decades, the government had focused on laying tracks on new routes, electrification and incremental rolling stock capacity addition. The focus has shifted to modernisation of rolling stock and safety systems, among other aspects.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112317825,imgsize-144990,width-400,resizemode-4/112317825.jpg"

Budget 2024 capital gains tax changes: The Narendra Modi government is considering suggestions for tweaks in the new long term capital gains tax regime that was announced by FM Nirmala Sitharaman in Union Budget 2024.The July 23 budget reduced the LTCG tax on property from 20% to 12.5%. The indexation benefit, which allowed taxpayers to adjust the acquisition cost for inflation before calculating capital gains and thus reduce their tax liability, is proposed to be eliminated for properties purchased on or after April 1, 2001. The government publishes the Cost Inflation Index (CII) annually for this calculation.India Inc is appealing to the government for a gradual shift to the long-term capital gains tax regime proposed in the FY25 budget, which aims to eliminate indexation benefits for property, gold, and other unlisted assets.According to an ET report by Deepshikha Sikarwar, the industry is suggesting alternatives such as a higher tax rate with indexation or a lower rate of 12.5% without indexation, as well as some form of grandfathering for ancestral properties.The finance ministry is currently reviewing these proposals and will discuss them with the Prime Minister's Office.

Budget 2024 for manufacturing sector : The recent Union Budget has struck a balance between fiscal consolidation and stimulating economic growth. While the middle class has been offered tax relief, the government's primary focus remains on judicious spending to maximize economic impact. The budget's core themes are employment, skilling, MSME development, and support for the middle class.Largely focus has remained intact on spending money judiciously to ensure that each penny spent creates a ripple effect in the entire economic landscape.Although at first glance, manufacturing might appear to have taken a backseat, a deeper analysis reveals a multifaceted approach to bolstering the sector. Initiatives like employment-linked benefits and internship programs, while primarily aimed at job creation and skill development, indirectly benefit manufacturing companies by expanding the talent pool.Extensive focus on the MSME manufacturing units by way of extending term loan facility for purchase of machinery and equipment without collateral or third-party guarantee, would help companies in augmenting their capital base/ capacity and strengthen the very foundation of the manufacturing ecosystem in the country. Development of a new credit-assessment model by Public Sector Banks to assess MSME credit shall provide much needed regulatory relief to the units.With respect to the large manufacturing entities, while there is no direct fiscal/ tax incentive introduced in this budget, some support has been provided with an extensive focus on development of ‘industrial parks’ in nearly 100 cities under the ‘plug and play’ model. Reforms proposed with respect to land administration, planning and management, shall also ease out acquisition related difficulties often faced by entrepreneurs/ business houses in acquiring lands for manufacturing set-ups.Targeted Customs duty interventions like, rationalization of Customs duty provisions in Mobile phone manufacturing setups, extension of Customs duty exemption on import of capital goods for manufacturing of solar cells and panels, full Customs duty exemption on import of 25 critical minerals,, shall provide the required impetus for enhancing domestic manufacturing environment.Governments’ focus on formulating an Economic Policy Framework to set the scope for next-gen reforms in the country, has a target to improve the productivity of factors of production, namely, land, labour, capital, entrepreneurship and technology. This shall pave the way for enabling achievement of a target of 25% manufacturing sector contribution to the nation’s GDP over the course of next 7-10 years.While the overall outlook is positive, the extension of tax benefits under Section 115BAB for manufacturing entities and the absence of new PLI schemes are notable omissions.The country’s manufacturing base is expanding as is reflective from the continuously increasing tax collections and expanding Purchasing Manager’s Index. It would be pertinent to see how the ground realities evolve vis-à-vis the vision envisaged, in the upcoming Financial Year.","While the overall outlook is positive, the extension of tax benefits under Section 115BAB for manufacturing entities and the absence of new PLI schemes are notable omissions.

Budget 2024: Armed with the vision to propel India to become a developed country by 2047, the Union Budget 2024 aims to focus largely towards strengthening the Make in India initiative and ease of doing business thereby providing the required stimulus to the manufacturing sector and enabling large scale job creation.On the Indirect tax front, the industry welcomes the much-needed announcement for a comprehensive review of the rate structure under Customs enabling ease in product classification and dispute reduction. The proposal of lowering of Customs duty on a plethora of raw materials and products including solar cells, critical minerals and bullion are encouraging measures. The rationale behind such reduction clearly indicates support towards domestic manufacturing, deepening value addition and supporting targets in reducing carbon footprint.Relevant amendments under the Customs law have been made to provide increased time limits for re-imports and re-exports to enhance competitiveness of the fledgling MRO sector. The government has extended significant duty reduction and exemption benefits to the healthcare and electronics sectors, continuing the impetus of incentives provided under the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme.Since their introduction in March 2020, the PLI schemes have indeed supported in revitalizing the manufacturing sector and strengthening the necessary supply chains. The success achieved in the mobile manufacturing sector has now enabled the Government to reduce customs duties on mobile phones and components, signalling a mature environment. The Budget proposals aim at reproducing similar outcomes for semiconductor and pharmaceutical industry by increasing the budgetary allocation.Buoyed by the increasing revenue collection under GST signalling a shift towards a mature tax regime, this Budget has harmonized the timeframes for the issuance of demand notices and adjudication orders for cases involving fraud, suppression or otherwise. Significant amendments to the GST legislations have been introduced reflecting the recommendations proposed by the GST Council such as regularizing non-levy of GST due to general practice which may turn out to be a breather for certain impacted industries reeling under huge tax demands.The Insurance sector has been provided much relief through the GST council recommendations which have been cemented in the present budget thereby ending long standing disputes on their business practices.The Government's efforts to push forward with its reform agenda are evident as plans to incentivize states for their business reform actions plans and digitalization through the Jan Vishwas Bill 2.0 is proposed. Further, setting up of e-commerce export hubs is envisaged to facilitate easier access to international markets for domestic players.The recent implementation of Budget proposals allows the government to maintain momentum in its reform agenda. These policy measures implicitly reaffirm the significance of India Inc as a crucial element in the development of infrastructure. However, there are still some expectations required to be met to march towards a Viksit Bharat 2047.","Union Budget 2024 aims to focus largely towards strengthening the Make in India initiative.

Budget 2024 : Real estate, a significant contributor to employment generation, has received a fair bit of attention in Budget 2024-25. Recent years have seen the sector transform rapidly, driven by factors such as favourable government policies, Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016, strong economic growth and changing consumer preferences.Added to that, the budgetary focus on job creation, skilling and employment-linked incentives, infrastructure, urban development, rural connectivity, digitalisation and land-related norms, all dovetail to promote growth of the sector.Launched in June 2015, the PMAY aims to provide affordable housing to all eligible beneficiaries. The budget unveiled PMAY Urban 2.0, under which the housing needs of 1 crore urban poor and middle class will be addressed with an investment of Rs 10 lakh crore.The central government’s additional Rs 2.2 lakh crore injection in the next 5 years to make housing more affordable has the potential to revitalise the affordable housing market.Such an approach can play an important role in realising the government's vision of Housing for All and push growth and development. Hence, the significant investment under PMAY Urban 2.0 is expected to alleviate urban housing deficits, spurring construction and economic growth.Steps to introduce technological reforms within the regulatory framework for land, such as digitalisation or GIS mapping of land records, will improve transparency.Rationalisation of stamp duty across states will also be critical to bring in uniformity and initiate land-related reforms such as urban planning, usage and building bylaws.These are steps in the right direction and will boost growth. Moreover, they will improve the ease of property transactions and strengthen municipal finances through increased property taxes. Rationalization of stamp duty with an emphasis on women homebuyers may boost home-buyer sentiment in major cities, too.The budget has also given ample attention to urban and rural development, with rental housing for industrial workers through the public private partnership model, interest subsidies for rental housing, and transit-oriented developments.The proposal to develop investment-ready plug-and-play industrial parks in 100 cities may attract industrial investment, leading to increased demand for industrial real estate and support the growth of ancillary services and residential developments in these regions.Initiatives for industrial parks and rental housing for industrial workers align with the country’s manufacturing goals and addresses worker accommodation needs.These steps are expected to promote industrial growth and stability in labour-intensive sectors, while also creating new opportunities for real estate developers specialising in rental and affordable housing.The changes in long-term capital gains (LTCG) tax, however, have evoked a mixed reaction. The government lowered the long-term capital gains tax from 20% to 12.5%, which is a welcome step. However, this came with the removal of the indexation benefit.The changes could encourage more liquidity in property transactions and potentially increase the effective tax burden depending on the property’s acquisition date.The launch of Phase IV of the PM Gram Sadak Yojana in 25,000 rural habitations will improve connectivity in rural areas, promoting rural development and making these regions more accessible for investment. The primary objective of PMGSY is to build robust, all-weather roads in rural habitations. This initiative focuses on enhancing connectivity and supporting economic development in rural areas.In essence, the budget is geared towards stimulating growth and investment in the real estate sector , fostering a more transparent and investor-friendly environment, and contributing to overall development. It aims to create a balanced and inclusive growth environment by addressing the needs of various segments, including affordable housing, industrial workers and urban infrastructure.The effectiveness of the initiatives, however, hinges on their implementation and continued support of complementary reforms.",The central government’s additional Rs 2.2 lakh crore injection in the next 5 years to make housing more affordable has the potential to revitalise the affordable housing market.

New Budget 2024 rule: Why Income Tax Department is likely to issue a huge number of tax notices this month,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/new-budget-2024-rule-why-income-tax-department-is-likely-to-issue-a-huge-number-of-tax-notices-this-month/articleshow/112186079.cms,"Taxing Times

Income Tax Notice on the way? The Income Tax Department is gearing up to send out a large number of notices in the coming month, as there are concerns that many taxpayers might escape the tax net due to the impending implementation of the new reassessment law on September 1, 2024.According to the amended regulation announced in Budget 2024 , the tax authorities can only go back a maximum of five years to reassess a taxpayer's records if the escaped income is at least Rs 50 lakh, and three years for an amount less than Rs 50 lakh.Previously, they could reassess cases up to 10 years old.According to an ET report, tax officials are now faced with the challenge of compiling and corroborating data on tax and income mismatches for the financial years 2013-14 to 2017-18 within the next few weeks, as these years will become time-barred for reassessment from September 1, 2024.The I-T department relies on information from various sources, such as banks, property registrars, and search findings from the investigation wing, to build reassessment cases.A tax officers' body has raised concerns about the feasibility of issuing notices under Section 148 (or 148A) in a large number of cases within a single month, given the overburdened nature of the jurisdictional assessing officers and the time-consuming process of obtaining sanction from the chief commissioner, who is the specified authority for such notices.Moreover, the law provides taxpayers with the right to explain their position before reassessment orders are finalized, a process that most believe cannot be completed by the end of August.Also Read | ITR refund status for FY 2023-24: How to check income tax refund status online - here’s a step-by-step guide for incometax.gov.in & NSDL websites The Central Board of Direct Taxes ( CBDT ) has been urged by its officers to postpone the effective date of the proposed amendment. However, this suggestion is unlikely to be well-received by corporations and high net worth individuals.""Capping the reassessment period at five years was a great decision as it would reduce hassles and litigation. But if the department fears there could be a genuine loss of revenue as it may not be possible to wrap up several matters by August 31, the government can think of strict parameters where time-bound cases can be selectively reopened - based on trails of steps taken in identifying escaped income,"" said Mitil Chokshi, partner at CA firm Chokshi & Chokshi.""Taxpayers may expect a rush of reassessment notices in August 2024. These notices are likely to be for the AYs 2018-19 and prior to that. It is pertinent to note that the Bombay High Court in a recent ruling in a case of Hexaware Technologies has taken a view on a proviso introduced in 2021, which can be interpreted to mean that AY 2017-18 (and prior years) got time barred on March 31, 2024. These reassessment notices (for AYs 2017-18 and prior) are likely to rake up new interpretation issues in the already muddled reassessment provisions,"" said Ashish Mehta, partner at law firm Khaitan & Co.The current situation is similar to the conflict between the Income Tax office and taxpayers in 2021. The reassessment law was amended in April 2021, allowing the tax office to reopen 10-year-old tax returns if the total undisclosed income exceeded Rs 50 lakh and reassess 4-year-old matters if the amount was less than Rs 50 lakh.Also Read | Latest NPS rules 2024: How much tax will you save with new NPS contribution benefit under new regime after Budget 2024? However, this change led to over 10,000 writ petitions being filed by companies, arguing that they were not given sufficient time to explain and that the notices were issued without considering the carve-out that cases which couldn't be reopened earlier couldn't be reassessed under the new law.The Supreme Court invoked its extraordinary powers under Article 142 of the Constitution on May 4, 2022, to uphold all reassessment notices issued after March 31, 2021. However, the court left room for judicial proceedings based on the merits of each case, and several such matters are currently pending before the court.","The Income Tax Department is gearing up to send out a large number of notices in the coming month.

How NPS will increase tax savings

NPS and EPF: Overlapping services

What is NPS Vatsalaya?

Latest NPS rules, news: In the Union Budget 2024 speech, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced two new initiatives with regard to National Pension Scheme (NPS) - extension of NPS 14% employer contribution benefits to private setcor and the intended launch of NPS Vatsalya.Budget 2024 announced the hiking of the tax deduction limit on private sector employers’ contributions to NPS from 10% to 14% of employees’ basic salaries, bringing it at par with the provisions available for government employees.Sriram Iyer, CEO, HDFC Pension Management told ET that with this move the “ground rules have been harmonised among government and non-government employees, which is a positive step.”Effectively, this means that now, private-sector employees can choose to reduce the taxable portion of employers’ contribution to their NPS corpus, thereby paying less tax and leaving greater funds in their pension deposits.“Employees will benefit from tax savings . More importantly, the 40% increase in contribution will have a significant impact on the terminal value of the retirement corpus,” remarked Iyer. The extended savings will “help in retirement planning, working as an option that is at par with the Provident Fund,” Dinesh Rohira, CEO & Founder, 5nance.com was quoted as saying.Moreover, the endeavour aims to increase NPS penetration by increasing tax incentives for the private sector, providing them a social security-cushion post-retirement.The scheme’s motive to widen the NPS subscriber base may not prove to be flawlessly effective, however. This is explained by Agrees Mrin Agarwal, Founder, Finsafe India: “While it’s good that the limit has been raised, it may not increase adoption as employees need to be educated in a big way. Also, the benefit is only for the salaried opting for the new tax regime,” she says.The mandatory contribution to the EPF, too, threatens to relegate the provisions of NPS under the umbrella of near-superfluity. This sentiment is echoed by Varun Sahay, a software engineer in a Delhi-based IT company: “When 12% of my salary is already deducted for the EPF, why should I put in more in the NPS and cut my take-home pay?”Rohira feels otherwise. “There’s no competition between the NPS and EPF as employees can contribute to both and build a 3-4 times bigger corpus while earning 3-4% higher returns via marketlinked options in the NPS,” he counters.Also Check | New Tax Regime 2023 vs 2024 After Budget: How Much Income Tax Will Salaried Taxpayers Save & How Do New Tax Slabs Compare To Old Regime? Top 10 Points You Must Know To jumpstart retirement savings for children, a new initiative called NPS Vatsalya has been unveiled in the Budget. This scheme allows parents and guardians to contribute to a minor's account, which can be converted into a regular NPS account once the child reaches adulthood.""It provides a very long duration for reaping the compounding benefits and accumulating a huge bounty at a later age. This can be a good way to plan a better future for kids who may not opt for a service segment in the future,"" says Rohira. Sriram Iyer agrees, stating, ""It’s a good move to help the child start his retirement journey. Even if a parent starts when the child is 10 years old, by the time he starts working, it can be a solid foundation for the compounding journey after that.""However, some experts question the utility of a product with such a long lock-in period, especially when parents cannot use the funds for essential goals like their child’s education amidst soaring education costs of 11-12%.""Parents are struggling to save for their own retirement, so it might be a bit of a stretch to expect them to save for their kids’ retirement. The need of the hour is a market-linked product that allows withdrawals only for the child’s education,"" says Mrin Agarwal, Founder of Finsafe India.Also Read | Latest NPS rules 2024: How much tax will you save with new NPS contribution benefit under new regime after Budget 2024? Though the NPS permits partial withdrawals, it allows only 25% of the corpus after three years of joining, and this can be done only three times during the entire tenure. A premature exit before 60 years with 100% withdrawal is only possible if the corpus is less than Rs.2.5 lakh, an amount insufficient for most children's goals.""In its current form, there won’t be any uptake,"" asserts Agarwal. Rohira concurs, ""It’s a vanilla product with a lock-in, which does not make it very attractive and it may not take off. However, the government may optimise it and introduce new features later."" Iyer adds, ""This is just a start and there may be more subscriber-friendly features as we take it to the market. The regulator is proactive and open to feedback.""","Budget 2024 announced the hiking of the tax deduction limit on private sector employers’ contributions to NPS from 10% to 14% of employees’ basic salaries.

Gold import duty cut in Budget 2024: The recent reduction in customs duty on gold imports in the Union Budget 2024 is expected to significantly impact the gold shopping habits of Indian consumers who frequently visit Dubai. Indian jewellers with stores in both India and the UAE believe that the narrowed duty differential will result in lower gold prices in India, making it less attractive for Indians to purchase gold in Dubai.The emirate had attracted gold-enthusiast Indians following a steep rise in customs duty in India in July 2022. In the fiscal 2024-25 budget, the duty on gold imports was more than halved.The duty cut is also expected to boost gold jewellery production in India, particularly the popular 'Kolkatti' jewellery from Kolkata, which is favored by Indian expats in Dubai and tourists from various countries. This move will encourage gold artisans to create new designs in both heavyweight and lightweight jewellery, attracting consumers to purchase gold from India.According to an ET report, Joy Alukkas, chairman of Joy Alukkas Group , estimates that nearly 50% of their UAE business will shift to India as Indian tourists who previously bought jewellery in Dubai will now prefer to shop in India. However, Indian expats living in Dubai and other customers may continue to buy from the UAE.Also Read | Gold losing sheen? Government cuts gold bond issuance target as investors look at better alternatives Rajiv Popley, director at Popley & Sons, believes that the perception of overseas gold being cheaper than in India is merely a mindset. He points out that the labour cost is significantly lower in India, and with the introduction of mandatory hallmarking and HUID numbers, the purity of gold in India is no longer a concern.Furthermore, NRIs in Dubai do not receive VAT refunds, and Indians travelling abroad only receive about 60% of the VAT back on their gold purchases. Gold trade analyst Bhargav Baidya suggests that the 1% duty differential between gold jewellery in India and Dubai will be offset by Indian jewellers offering discounts to retain and attract customers.Saurabh Gadgil, chairman of PNG Jewellers, notes that Indian import duty is now on par with the US, allowing Indian jewellers to offer competitive prices compared to other countries worldwide. The reduced customs duty is expected to make gold purchases in India more attractive and convenient for Indian consumers, potentially leading to a significant shift in their gold shopping preferences.","The reduction in customs duty on gold imports in the Union Budget 2024 is expected to significantly impact the gold shopping habits of Indian consumers.

Gold Bonds losing sheen

Gold losing sheen? The government has reduced its target for issuing gold bonds in the financial year 2024-25 by 38% compared to the previous interim budget goal, according to a senior official. The revised target stands at Rs 18,500 crore, down from Rs 29,638 crore estimated in the interim budget and Rs 26,852 crore (revised estimate) in 2023-24.The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told ET ""The decision followed a reassessment of various factors, including investor demand, other investment products and uncertainties around the global economy, as the situation has changed since the interim budget in February.""After accounting for redemptions, the net issuances of sovereign gold bonds are now estimated at Rs 15,000 crore for this fiscal year, a significant decrease from the Rs 26,138 crore projected in the interim budget and Rs 25,352 crore in the revised estimate for 2023-24.Harish Galipelli, director at ILA Commodities India, attributed this shift to retail investors increasingly opting for equities in anticipation of better returns. He also noted that people are uncertain about the potential for further increases in gold prices in the short-to-medium term following a recent rally. Additionally, Galipelli pointed out that savings in rural areas have been impacted by retail inflation and other factors.The gold bond and gold monetisation schemes were introduced by the government in late 2015 to discourage the physical purchase of precious metals and reduce imports, thereby mitigating the negative impact on the current account deficit.The gross collection through these two schemes is now projected to be Rs 20,030 crore in 2024-25, compared to Rs 31,168 crore in the interim budget and Rs 28,240 crore (revised estimate) in the previous fiscal year. Similarly, the net collection is estimated at Rs 16,433 crore, down from Rs 27,571 crore in the interim budget and Rs 26,653 crore in the previous year. However, the estimates for the gold monetisation scheme remain unchanged from the interim budget level.Also Read | Budget 2024: Duty cuts on gold, silver, platinum, and diamonds to make jewellery more affordable The sovereign gold bond scheme targets investors who view gold as an investment, encouraging them to purchase paper gold instead of physical gold.On the other hand, the gold monetisation scheme aims to bring out idle gold held by households, temple trusts, and others to increase domestic supply. Both schemes were designed to curb gold imports, which, along with crude oil, have been significant contributors to India's current account deficit. Gold bond issuances had moderated after reaching Rs 16,049 crore during the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020-21, before experiencing a surge in 2023-24.","The government has reduced its target for issuing gold bonds in the financial year 2024-25 by 38% compared to the previous interim budget goal.

This indicates a declining workforce demand, despite overall economic strength.The monthly average of weekly claims decreased by 3,750 to 217,750, smoothing out weekly fluctuations.Jobless benefit applications serve as an indicator of US redundancies.Following weakening employment figures and declining consumer prices, the Federal Reserve reduced its benchmark interest rate by 0.5 percentage points in September, followed by a 0.25-point reduction this month.Fed officials anticipated four benchmark rate reductions next year, following three cuts this year, as projected in September. However, this outlook has rapidly evolved.Recent robust economic indicators and President-elect Donald Trump's proposed policies have prompted a more conservative approach from the Fed, potentially resulting in fewer reductions and higher rates than previously anticipated.The central bank has shifted its priority from inflation control to employment support, aiming to achieve a delicate balance of reducing inflation without triggering economic decline.September's 0.5-point rate reduction marked the Fed's first cut in four years, following increases since 2022 that elevated the federal funds rate to 5.3%, a 20-year high.Despite October's slight increase, inflation has consistently declined over two years, approaching the Fed's 2% goal, leading Chair Powell to confirm its general containment.In late October, government reports showed a Fed-monitored inflation measure reached its lowest point in three-and-a-half years.Early 2024 saw jobless benefit applications averaging 213,000 weekly before rising in May. July figures reached 250,000, suggesting high interest rates were affecting US employment.The US economy generated only 12,000 jobs in October, though economists noted the impact of strikes and hurricanes on temporary unemployment.The Labour Department's August report revealed 818,000 fewer jobs were created from April 2023 through March than initially reported, indicating a gradual employment slowdown and influencing the Fed's rate reduction decisions.","US unemployment benefit applications dropped by 6,000 to a near seven-month low to 213,000 last week.

"Group of nations representing 30% of global GDP, 15% global GHG emissions commits to enhancing NDCs to align with 1.5°C pathway",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/group-of-nations-representing-30-of-global-gdp-15-global-ghg-emissions-commits-to-enhancing-ndcs-to-align-with-1-5c-pathway/articleshow/115536234.cms,"BATHINDA: A group of nations, representing roughly 30% of global GDP and nearly 15% of global GHG emissions, have committed to enhancing their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) to align with a 1.5°C pathway . This announcement demonstrates that limiting global warming to 1.5°C with limited overshoot is still possible with strong mitigation efforts. The countries have committed to a linear or steeper trajectory of emissions reductions as a floor for ambition in their next NDCs. This is a critical step towards achieving the Paris Agreement goals.This is the first time countries have explicitly defined how their individual emissions reduction goals will align with the collective global stocktake call at COP28. Recent analysis shows that if all countries reduce emissions on a straight line to net zero GHG—and those who have not yet set all-GHG net zero targets do so—global temperature rise would be limited to an average of 1.4C by the end of the century. This is a dramatic improvement from the average 2.7C temperature rise that the world is currently on track for.The United Kingdom, Brazil, and the United Arab Emirates have announced 2035 NDC targets that set a high bar for ambition. Bhutan, Madagascar, Panama, and Suriname have already achieved net zero greenhouse gas emissions.Canada, Chile, the European Union, Georgia, Mexico, Norway, and Switzerland aim to submit next NDCs that are consistent with the IPCC emissions trajectories and the global stocktake call for deep, rapid, and sustained reductions in greenhouse gas emissions in line with 1.5°C. Absolute, economy-wide reduction targets covering all greenhouse gases, sectors, and categories; and aligned with steep and credible emissions reductions toward their respective mid-century net zero goals, consistent with a linear or steeper trajectory.""Together, we recognize the urgency of action to address the climate crisis and the critical role of major emitters in putting the world on a 1.5°C pathway. We are committed to delivering on the goals of the Paris Agreement and keeping 1.5°C within reach and recognize the significant economic imperatives and opportunities of strong climate action ,"" read a joint statement.“GZERO Nations have set the standard for what true climate leadership looks like. We stand as living proof that net-zero emissions are attainable, even for nations with limited resources. We call on the rest of the world to rise to the occasion, match our ambition, and embrace transformational changes to keep 1.5°C within reach. Climate leadership knows no borders, and the time for bold action is now,” joint statement from Prime Minister Tshering Tobgay of Bhutan; President Andry Rajoelina of Madagascar, President Jose Raul Mulino of Panama, President Chan Santokhi of Suriname.“The Paris Agreement is working and keeping 1.5C within reach is both an environmental imperative and an economic opportunity. That’s why I join global partners to call for climate ambition as we commit to putting forward ambitious 2035 climate plans. Canada understands its responsibility and looks forward to securing an ambitious and hopeful outcome that delivers for the people and the planet at COP29”, said Steven Guilbeault, Canada's minister of environment and climate change.“Mexico is committed for renewed commitment to ambitious climate action as a foundational condition for social justice and shared prosperity. The next round of NDCs is not just our last chance to keep 1.5C within reach, but the greatest opportunity of this century to trigger structural transformation of our development model for people and the planet” said Mexico Minister Secretary of Environment and Natural Resources Alicia Bárcena.","The countries have committed to a linear or steeper trajectory of emissions reductions as a floor for ambition in their next NDCs.

Prior to this latest amalgamation of two of those groups, Group CEO Wu had also been CEO of the Taobao and Tmall Group and Alibaba's cloud division.Alibaba's e-commerce platforms have been under pressure both at home and abroad as aggressive new players such as PDD Holdings' Chinese platform Pinduoduo and international site Temu, along with ByteDance's domestic Chinese Douyin and international TikTok, gain market share selling low-cost goods.In April, co-founder Jack Ma expressed support for the internet giant's restructuring efforts, and acknowledged past mistakes in a lengthy memo to employees.The turnaround efforts have seen some success, with the international division growing rapidly under Jiang's leadership. In September quarter earnings last week, AIDC reported stand-out growth of 29%.China's challenging consumer environment has put pressure on all retailers and e-commerce platforms, though Alibaba appears to have halted some erosion of its lead in market share in recent quarters.After the government unveiled economic stimulus measures in September, this year's Singles Day sales festival, China's biggest shopping event, outperformed muted analyst expectations.Alibaba did not disclose sales figures for the almost month-long event, but said there was ""robust growth"" in sales and a record number of shoppers.",Alibaba Group will merge its domestic and international e-commerce platforms. The new Alibaba E-commerce Business Group will be run by one leader for the first time.

Early presale performance and growing interest suggest potential market enthusiasm for this concept. AI-generated projections highlight possible price points of $10, $50, and $100, reflecting its anticipated trajectory.The presale performance of Rexas Finance (RXS) has shown encouraging resultse. Through Stage 6 at $0.08 per token, RXS has raised around $8.95 million. Unlike many initiatives dependent on venture capital financing, the team behind Rexas Finance decided to forgo VC funding and instead involve the public in what they consider a revolution in tokenized assets. Key elements guiding the presale success—investment confidence and community involvement—have been strengthened by this decision. The inclusion of Rexas Finance (RXS) on main sites like CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko has given still another degree of visibility and confidence. Furthermore, the Certik audit has confirmed the dependability and security of the project, therefore increasing its appeal to institutional as well as individual investors. This strong basis and its goal of tokenizing a broad spectrum of assets—including intellectual property, art, and real estate—have driven the upward momentum of the token. Currently, artificial intelligence models predict when this momentum might propel RXS to significant price levels.Influenced by various key factors, the AI-driven analysis projects Rexas Finance (RXS) to hit the $10 mark by Q1 2025. Firstly the great demand and outstanding presale performance point to major market interest and possible adoption.

Moreover, as knowledge of RXS increases, a growing community is probably going to boost demand and trade activity, hence driving prices up. At $0.08 right now, a gain to $10 would be an amazing 12,400% increase, reflecting the past performance of other popular coins during bull markets.Guided by several key factors, AI analysis indicates that Rexas Finance may reach the $50 mark by the end of 2025. First, the user-friendly way the platform creates and trades asset-backed tokens is supposed to boost acceptance among companies and people. Furthermore appealing to institutional investors looking for exposure to the growing real-world asset (RWA) industry is Rexas Finance's Certik audit and creative use case. Moreover, past performance of projects with real-world value indicates that they perform remarkably well in bull markets, so Rexas Finance should gain from this trend. From its presale pricing, reaching a $50 price goal would be a notable improvement, therefore confirming RXS as among the best investment prospects available this cycle.Based on the artificial intelligence forecasts, Rexas Finance might hit the $100 mark by early 2027, in line with the accomplishment of notable events. By tokenizing billions of dollars worth of assets yearly, the platform is predicted to achieve mainstream adoption by this point and maybe become a major actor in the real-world asset (RWA) market. Moreover, as more areas adopt tokenized assets, Rexas Finance is probably going to take a sizable portion of this growing industry. Further potential for RXS token value growth could come from partnerships with traditional financial institutions and other blockchain initiatives , which may enhance liquidity and utility. With projections suggesting a $100 target, Rexas Finance is positioning itself as a noteworthy crypto asset with possible opportunities for investors.Its high presale pace, solid technological basis, and confidence built by its Certik audit appeal, especially to investors. These elements have made Rexas Finance the crypto prediction worth monitoring.

The company recently replaced Intel in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.

Nvidia continues to dominate the tech world, surpassing Wall Street’s expectations once again with its latest quarterly earnings. The company reported record revenue, driven by skyrocketing demand for its semiconductors, which are essential for artificial intelligence (AI) applications.In the quarter ending October 31, Nvidia's revenue nearly doubled, reaching $35.1 billion—an increase of 94 per cent from the same period last year. The company’s data centre business, a key driver of its success, reported $30.8 billion in revenue, a 112 per cent jump year-on-year.

Since Trump’s election victory on November 5, the broader crypto market has added over $800 billion in value, data from CoinGecko shows.Market analyst Joel Kruger from LMAX Group attributed the rally to increased institutional adoption, highlighting that the approval of spot bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs in 2024 signifies the ""maturation of the crypto market.""MicroStrategy, the largest corporate holder of bitcoin, saw its stock rise 10% on Wednesday, pushing its weekly gains to 39%.

Ford has 28,000 employees in Europe, and 174,000 worldwide.""The global auto industry continues to be in a period of significant disruption as it shifts to electrified mobility,"" the company said in a statement. ""The transformation is particularly intense in Europe where automakers face significant competitive and economic headwinds while also tackling a misalignment between CO2 regulations and consumer demand for electrified vehicles,"" the statement said.In Europe, automakers must sell enough electric vehicles to meet new, lower limits for fleet average carbon dioxide emissions in 2025, and face a longer term 2035 EU goal of reducing emissions to zero, which would mean the elimination of most vehicles with internal combustion engines.EV sales however have lagged as consumers weary of inflation have held back on spending and after major car market Germany dropped government purchase incentives for EVs. Electric vehicles sales fell by 5.8% in the first nine months of the year in an overall shrinking market for cars.

Remember Flappy Bird? That frustratingly fun game where you tap the screen to put a pixelated bird through a green pipe. It looked straight out of a Mario game and is now making a comeback! Originally, the viral sensation hit both the Apple App Store and Google Play Store in 2014. Ten years later, a group calling itself “The Flappy Bird Foundation Group” announced it had acquired the rights to the game to make sure it would stay playable by fans forever. What’s more, the Foundation says that fans will now be able to share in the success of the legendary brand’s relaunch.At its core, Flappy Bird is an endless runner game that challenges players to tap the screen to guide Flappy.

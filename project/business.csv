Universal Pension Scheme

Universal Pension Scheme : India is exploring a nationwide voluntary pension initiative that would provide social security coverage to all citizens, according to officials. Initial discussions have begun at the labour and employment ministry regarding this comprehensive pension programme.Officials indicate that the fundamental structure of the scheme, under the Employees' Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO), is currently under development.The objective is to provide benefits to workers in the unorganised sector, traders, self-employed individuals, and any person aged 18 and above who wishes to receive pension benefits after turning 60.""The scheme, which would be voluntary and contributory, will not be tied to employment and hence will be open for everyone to contribute and earn a pension,"" a senior government official told ET.Following the planning phase, the ministry will engage with stakeholders to finalise the Universal Pension Scheme details.The initiative aims to incorporate existing central schemes to enhance their appeal and simplify procedures whilst expanding coverage across society.The government is considering consolidating various pension programmes, including PM-SYM and NPS-Traders, into a comprehensive scheme. These optional programmes provide subscribers aged 60 and above with a monthly pension of ₹3,000, based on contributions ranging from ₹55 to ₹200, matched by government funding.Also Read | What is LIC Smart Pension Plan? Top 10 FAQs answered on new retirement planning scheme The unified scheme might incorporate the Atal Pension Yojana , which is presently overseen by PFRDA.The proposal suggests utilising the cess collected through the Building and Other Construction Workers Act to provide pensions for construction industry workers.The central government may encourage states to integrate their pension schemes into this unified programme, ensuring equitable distribution of government contributions, enhanced pension amounts and elimination of duplicate beneficiaries.By 2036, India's elderly population (aged 60 and above) is projected to reach 227 million, constituting 15% of the total population, increasing to 347 million (20%) by 2050.Several developed nations, including the US, Europe, Canada, Russia and China, maintain comprehensive social insurance systems encompassing social security, pensions, healthcare and unemployment benefits.Currently, India's social security framework primarily comprises the provident fund system, alongside old-age pensions and health insurance provided by the Centre to specific beneficiaries, predominantly those living below the poverty line.","The objective is to provide benefits to workers in the unorganised sector, traders, self-employed individuals, and any person aged 18 and above who wishes to receive pension benefits after turning 60.

Latest income tax calculation post Budget 2025: Starting April 1, 2025, individuals earning up to Rs 12 lakh in taxable income under the new income tax regime will not need to pay any tax. For those earning above this threshold, there are ways to structure their salary to maintain taxable income below Rs 12 lakh. Various allowances within the new income tax regime can assist in reducing the taxable income to this limit.ET quotes Harsh Bhuta, Partner of Bhuta Shah & Co., a tax consulting firm as saying, ""Under the new tax regime, there are certain allowances in the Income Tax Act that can help taxpayers to rejig their salary structure. These allowances are exempt from tax in the new tax regime if certain conditions are met. These allowances can help taxpayers to reduce taxable income under the new tax regime.""Also Read | ITR filing with latest income tax slabs post Budget 2025: Will taxpayers with income below Rs 12 lakh have to file tax return? Employers can reimburse work-related travel expenses incurred by employees. Bhuta says, ""The conveyance reimbursement received by an employee is exempt if the same is expended while commuting to the workplace. An employee is required to submit bills to claim reimbursement.""This provision applies to specially-abled individuals. Unlike conveyance reimbursement, this allowance covers travel between home and workplace. Bhuta says, ""The transport allowance received by specially-abled employees is exempted up to Rs 3,200 per month or Rs 38,400 per annum. Only those specially-abled employees are exempted if they are blind/deaf/dumb or orthopaedically handicapped with a disability of the lower extremities.""Salaried employees can receive tax exemptions for reimbursed telephone bills. According to Yogesh Kale, Executive Director of Nangia Andersen LLP, ""There is no limit prescribed concerning the exemption of telephone and internet bills under either of the old or new income tax regimes. However, as an ideal practice, the reimbursement amount should be reasonable, considering an employee's designation and the roles and responsibilities.""He further explains, ""As telephone and internet expenses generally go hand in hand, many employers provide exemptions in respect of internet reimbursements to employees under the income tax rules, though the said rules provide that telephone expenses incurred by the employer on behalf of the employees do not qualify as perquisites in the old or new tax regime and do not specifically mention internet expenses.""Also Read | New vs old income tax regime after Budget 2025: 8 salary perks to save around Rs 1.35 lakh income tax under old regime Staff members have the option to restructure their salary packages to incorporate telephone, mobile and internet bill reimbursements, potentially lowering their taxable income.Employers' car leasing arrangements can contribute to reducing taxable salary. When an employer provides a vehicle for both personal and official use, it is classified as a perquisite under the Income Tax Act.Kale explains, ""The perquisite value of a car given by the employer for the employee's personal and official use as per the income tax rules is very low. The valuation mechanism remains the same under the old and new regimes. The taxable value of such perquisite is Rs 1,800 per month if the engine's cubic capacity does not exceed 1.6 litres. An amount of Rs 2,400 per month would be taxable if the engine's cubic capacity exceeds 1.6 litres.""He continues, ""An amount of Rs 900 per month is added to the value of perquisite if the chauffeur is also provided to run the car. (Employees should remember that expenses on maintenance and running are met or reimbursed by the employer.) Thus, the amount taxable as perquisite in respect of a car given by the employer for the employee's personal and official use is much less as compared to the actual amount of expenditure that may be incurred by the employer.""The analysis presents two scenarios with varying basic salary percentages (30% and 40% of CTC). Higher basic salary percentages within the CTC enable greater tax savings at elevated CTC levels. Tax exemptions apply to mobile and conveyance reimbursements when bills are submitted timely to employers. Both cases include employer NPS contributions at 14% of basic salary under the new regime.The net taxable income reduces to Rs 12 lakh in both instances. This reduction occurs through submission of mobile and conveyance bills, claiming the Rs 75,000 standard deduction under the new regime, and employer NPS contributions under Section 80CCD (2) of the Income Tax Act.These calculations exclude additional income sources like share dividends, savings account interest, and fixed deposit returns. Including these would alter the final calculations.Kale states, ""The new tax regime from FY 2025-26 (AY 2026-27) offers lower tax rates but limits many salary-based exemptions and deductions. Although options such as the ones discussed above provide a bit of scope for reducing the tax burden, the opportunities are more limited than under the old regime.""Under the new regime, meal coupons (Sodexo) from employers are taxable, whereas the old regime allowed tax exemption up to Rs 26,400 yearly (Rs 2,200 per month).Also Read | Income Tax Slabs FY 2025-26 explained: 20 FAQs individual taxpayers should check to understand tax rates, income tax benefit under new tax regime",Several allowances are available for taxpayers to restructure their salary and lower their taxable income.

New Income Tax Bill 2025 : Representing a historic milestone in India’s tax landscape, Hon. Finance Minister – Madam Nirmala Sitharaman has presented the Income Tax Bill, 2025 (Bill) in the Parliament on 13 February 2025.The current Income tax law - Income Tax Act, 1961 (the current Act) was enacted more than six decades ago. With passage of time there were multiple amendments made to the law. Many believed this resulted in the current Act becoming difficult to read, complex to interpret and resulted in unwarranted litigation as well. Hence, it was indeed an opportune time to embark on an exercise to simplify the same. While an attempt was made to this effect a decade ago with the draft Direct Tax Code (DTC) – it never became legislation.Globally as well, countries like the UK, Australia etc., had undertaken similar exercises to enhance clarity and compliance in their taxation laws. Hence, a new simplified income tax law in India was definitely the need of the hour.Also Read | ITR filing with latest income tax slabs post Budget 2025: Will taxpayers with income below Rs 12 lakh have to file tax return? The Bill is prepared by investing more than 60,000 man-hours and has 23 chapters and 2.6 lakh words in comparison to 46 chapters and 5.12 lakh words respectively when compared with the Current Act. The number of Sections has also dramatically reduced from 800 plus sections to 536 Sections only.Secondly the language used in the Bill at many places is extremely lucid and is reader friendly as it has tables and formulas as against the traditional verbose style.One of the most significant aspects of the Bill is the elimination of the concepts of ‘previous year’ and ‘assessment year’. India is trying to join the league of comparable tax jurisdictions by using one single term ‘tax year’. The current terms of previous year and assessment year was apparently leading to mistakes by taxpayers while filing forms/ challans etc. With now only one term “tax year” it will hopefully avoid confusion.Largely, there are no changes to the definition of residency or even salary related provisions for that matter. In fact the choice of the two tax regimes continues to be available to individual taxpayers. There is no change to the tax rates and capital gains tax regime also remains the same.Also Read | New Income Tax Bill 2025 explained: Top 30 FAQs every taxpayer should check TDS and TCS provisions have been made easier to comprehend by providing tables instead of the existing provisions which have lengthy texts that are open to interpretation issues and quite often difficult to understand. The Bill now also gives the ability for individuals to apply for a Lower or NIL rate of TCS while they purchase a car, pay for foreign tour, or make remittance abroad under the Liberalised Remittance Scheme (LRS) of the Reserve Bank of India.It is also interesting to note that elaborate provisions have been enunciated for dealing with transition from the current Act to the new law.There is a clear focus on encouragement of compliance with the mantra of “Trust first, scrutinize later” – as stated by Hon. FM in her recent Feb 2025 Budget speech.As and when the Bill is enacted, the administrative measures for implementing them will be made operational (e.g., publishing of rules, IT infrastructure revamp etc.), keeping in mind the convenience of taxpayers and all stakeholders. For the common man, it is anticipated that the Bill will help in easy understanding of law and smoother tax compliances.","The current Income tax law - Income Tax Act, 1961 (the current Act) was enacted more than six decades ago.

The e-bikes maker is also preparing to enter overseas markets having cleared homologation (roadworthiness certification) for Europe for the F77 Mach2.Valued at $330 million in its last fund-raise in 2022, the company has sold around 1,000 units of the F77 since its launch in 2023. With rapid expansion beyond Bangalore - it has entered 11 new cities recently, including Delhi, Mumbai, Ahmedabad, Hyderabad, Pune, Chennai and Vizag - it hopes to corner higher sales. ""By the end of this year, the target is to reach around 50 cities."" The company's F99 racing prototype motorcycle had hit 258 kms per hour in Jan this year, which is the fastest for an India-made two-wheeler.Subramaniam said while the F77 (pitted against petrol bikes from brands such as Triumph, KTM and Royal Enfield) will continue to be the flagship model, the three motorcycles - to be available across multiple price segments - would primarily compete with petrol models that are in the 150-300cc segments. ""The price of these motorcycles will be relatively competitive when compared to the F77, and when fully launched, the portfolio can comfortably be priced under Rs 2 lakh. The new bikes will include an urban commuter and an adventure tourer. The scooter will also be an urban commuter, but will come with a long range option.""Rajmohan said the company's key focus is on indigenisation and building in-house capabilities. ""There was a near seven-year pre-launch R&D in areas such as battery technology , motor, battery management system, and vehicle control unit.""","Bangalore-based Ultraviolette Automotive sells the F77 bike (Mach2 and Super Street) priced upwards of Rs 3 lakh.

""Maintaining tax buoyancy in the 1.2-1.5 range could help the Govt of India achieve 6.5-7% GDP growth,"" the EY Report said.Indian economy is projected to grow in range of 6.3-6.8% in next fiscal. In current fiscal, the GDP growth is estimated to be 6.4%. EY report further said over the past decade, the govt has reduced its fiscal deficit to GDP ratio from 4.1% in FY15 to 3.4% in FY19, with the ratio expected to adjust to 4.4% by FY26. agencies","India has to maintain a tax buoyancy in the range of 1.2-1.5 to achieve a growth of 6.5-7%, a EY report said.

Adding to their pain is the tightening of post-education work visa norms, which dims chances of higher pay abroad and repay loan sooner back home.In six months, the rupee has depreciated by about 5% to 87.2 against the dollar from 83.5 in Aug. That's an increase of Rs 5 lakh on a Rs 1-crore tuition-plus-expenses budget.At the same time, the UK has proposed requiring international graduates to secure graduate-level jobs with salaries between 36,000-40,000 pounds to stay beyond two years. Canada too is tightening immigration rules for Indian students, by allowing officials to cancel permits and ending the Student Direct Stream visa program.""Earlier, students used the post-education work visa to earn in dollars and repay a large part of their loans. For Indian students in undergraduate programs, the impact could be severe as their total cost of education is in excess of Rs 1.5 crore in the US,"" said Ajay Bohora, co-founder of education loan company HDFC Credila.This means either a longer repayment period or higher EMIs on their education loans , said Bohora. The weak rupee also increases costs for students flying back. According to Bohora, the higher financial burden on families will require students to be more frugal.""I am now sending $800 a month instead of $900 for my daughter's food & board in the US. Govt has, on top of that, put TCS, which is an additional burden. So, on my tax-paid money, I am paying tax for the second time via TCS. Though I can get a refund, it has blocked my tax-paid money for a year,"" said Sudha Pai, a Mumbai resident.""While fluctuations are a regular phenomenon, this year there has been a huge upward rise in the dollar. Coupled with the uncertainty caused by the political scenario in the wake of elections, the impact on overseas education has been huge,"" said K P Singh, an education counsellor & founder, Institute of Management & Foreign Studies.According to Karan Gupta, a career counsellor, parents can 'lock in' foreign exchange rates by getting a loan sanctioned early and transferring funds to the university account to hedge against depreciation. ""Students should avoid foreign currency loans, as it would be more expensive to repay when they return to India. They should also apply to universities that offer financial aid and scholarships, thereby reducing their financial burden,"" said Gupta.Bohora attributes the restrictions on student work visas to ""economic patriotism,"" which is on the rise in the US, the UK, and Canada.The US has signalled its intent to attract highly skilled global talent to drive technological innovation and economic growth. Indian students who want to pursue higher education in the US would have to explore emerging fields such as GenAI, cybersecurity, distributed finance, blockchain, and digital currencies to enhance job prospects.According to Singh, students should not focus solely on traditional fields like coding and programming but should explore new-age areas. He added that those without the financial resources should not take risks by pursuing courses with limited employment potential.","In six months, the rupee has depreciated by about 5% to 87.2 against the dollar from 83.5 in Aug.

NEW DELHI: India is gearing up for the development of a 50km hyperloop corridor for commercial transport following the successful creation of a 422m test track by IIT Madras with backing from Indian Railways, Union Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw announced. If built, it could be the world's longest hyperloop track.""The first tube will go a long way in developing technologies. The time has come when after the first two grants of $1 million each (nearly ₹9 crore), the third grant of $1 million will be given to IIT Madras for further developing the hyperloop project in a nice way. And once we see the commercial or rather pre-commercial where the product is ready, then within the railway set-up we will start the first commercial project. We will decide a site, which can be used for good commercial transportation of 40km-50km and then we will go for it,"" Vaishnaw said during the closing ceremony of Asia's first Global Hyperloop Competition at IIT Madras.Sources indicate that the proposed test track for commercial operations will enable the railways to evaluate the feasibility of hyperloop technology, which can achieve speeds of up to 1,200 kmph. The first test track, completed in December last year, will serve as the foundation for further advancements.Hyperloop technology aims to revolutionize travel by drastically cutting journey times between cities, offering a faster alternative to conventional rail and air transport. The concept, first proposed in the 1970s by Swiss professor Marcel Juffer, saw early development efforts by Swissmetro SA in 1992, though the company was liquidated in 2009.Currently, eight major hyperloop projects are underway worldwide, including Virgin Hyperloop, which has been testing its systems in Nevada, and Canadian firm TransPod, which is constructing a test track to validate its design.Meanwhile, the railway ministry stated that IIT Madras and Indian Railways will also collaborate on vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) vehicles.","India is gearing up for the development of a 50km hyperloop corridor for commercial transport.

The city's highest recorded maximum temperature in the month of Feb was 39.6° C in 1966.For Wednesday, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) maintained a heatwave warning for Mumbai, Thane, and Raigad. For Thursday, it issued a warning for very likely hot and humid conditions in isolated pockets. The IMD declares a heatwave when maximum temperatures cross 37°C, and the departure is 4.5° above normal.At 38.7°C, the IMD Santacruz observatory's day temperature on Tuesday was 5.9° above normal and slightly higher than Monday's 38.4°C, while in the case of IMD Colaba observatory, which recorded 34.6°C, it was 3.6° above normal, but surprisingly lower than the previous day's 36.8°C .Echoing most Mumbaikars' sentiments, Marine Drive resident Mahendra Hemdev said he now carries a cap, sunglasses and a water bottle when he steps out. ""Such weather is generally not expected in the month of Feb. Now, I am worried about what will happen in May when the heat is at an all-time high,"" he added.The IMD attributed the heatwave conditions to a delayed sea breeze, strong easterly winds, and a mid-level anticyclone, which prevented air from rising. ""Heatwave warning has been issued for Wednesday as well, and day temperatures would be around 37-39°C. We appeal to the public to avoid sun exposure for a prolonged period,"" said Sushma Nair, a scientist at IMD Mumbai.Rajesh Kapadia, who runs the private weather forecasting blog Vagaries of the Weather, pointed out the stark contrast between day and night temperatures. On Tuesday, the IMD's Colaba and Santacruz observatories recorded minimum temperatures of 23.4°C and 20.9°C, respectively.""The city is currently experiencing dry heat, and temperatures may not necessarily rise further as summer sets in. While daytime temperatures are high, humidity levels remain comparatively lower, which is why we aren't perspiring as much as we do during peak summer. In summer, even at 33-34°C, high humidity makes it feel like 38-39°C,"" Kapadia explained. On Tuesday, the IMD recorded humidity levels of 54% at Colaba and 32% at Santacruz.Kapadia predicted that some relief from the heat could be expected into the weekend.Filmmaker Ashoke Pandit said outdoor shoots in the city can get very uncomfortable in such weather conditions.

NEW DELHI: While Tuesday's order sentencing Congress leader Sajjan Kumar to life imprisonment may offer some solace to a section of victims of anti-Sikh riots of 1984, Kumar remains the only heavyweight politician brought to justice till now.Before the Justice Nanavati Commission of Inquiry, several witnesses pointed fingers of suspicion at senior Congress leaders , including Jagdish Tytler , Sajjan Kumar, Kamal Nath, Dharam Dass Shastri and HKL Bhagat. However, in 2005, the panel recommended action only against Kumar and Tytler, after which the CBI registered fresh cases. Kumar's conviction is the outcome of one such case.Tytler, once a key Congress leader in Delhi, was also named in a report by the Nanavati Commission, but he initially benefitted from closure reports filed by CBI in courts. Between 2007 and 2015, CBI repeatedly informed the court that it had no evidence to prosecute Tytler. However, the closure reports were rejected by the courts, and it was only last year that the Congress leader pleaded not guilty to charges, including murder and provocation with intent to cause a riot that was related to the killing of three men outside Delhi's Pul Bangash gurdwara during the 1984 riots.Earlier, a court ordered the framing of charges, ruling that enough evidence was provided by the CBI to proceed to a trial. Apart from murder and intent to cause a riot, Tytler faces charges of unlawful assembly, rioting, disobedience to order, defiling a place of worship, abetment, mischief by fire and theft.Another Congress leader from Delhi who was named in commissions of inquiry was HKL Bhagat, and his role was investigated by the police. Bhagat, who was briefly jailed by a sessions court in the 1990s as his bail was rejected in one of the cases, passed away in 2009 but was never charged with any offence.In 2015, the Centre set up an SIT comprising a judge and two policemen, which began sifting through evidence and closed cases to examine steps that could be taken. It was only in 2019 that the SIT, under the watch of the Supreme Court, decided to reopen seven anti-Sikh riot cases, where the accused were either acquitted or the trial was closed.Last year, Delhi High Court sought the stand of the SIT on a plea seeking action against Kamal Nath for his alleged role in a case relating to the 1984 riots. The case relates to a mob of rioters storming the Gurdwara Rakab Ganj Sahib in the city. Nath has previously denied any link and dismissed all allegations of his involvement.While five persons were named as accused in the case, they were discharged for lack of evidence. However, Nath was never named in the FIR.","Sajjan Kumar remains the only heavyweight politician brought to justice till now.

Sahil Bloom with family

This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.

In a semi-kayfabe culture of productivity hacks and KPIs, Sahil Bloom has some real insights. The investor, entrepreneur, and author sits across from me in his office, occasionally glancing at what I imagine is a meticulously structured calendar. His recent book, “The 5 Types of Wealth,” has been gaining traction not just in business circles but among a broader audience seeking a more comprehensive approach to success.“Money is an enabler, not a goal,” Bloom states with conviction early in our conversation. It's a sentiment that might sound trite coming from someone else, but Bloom's background in finance and investing lends the observation a certain gravitas. “What gets measured gets managed,” he continues, referencing Peter Drucker . “Money's measurability means that for most people, that's the only thing they focus on and optimize around.”This observation forms one pillar of Bloom's philosophy: We've been measuring the wrong things. Through his research and conversations with successful individuals, Bloom identified four recurring themes that contribute to a fulfilling life: time, people, purpose, and health. The financial component, while important, serves primarily as an enabler rather than an end in itself.“A big part of the book, and the entire idea, is that we need to measure the bigger picture of what really matters in building a fulfilling life,” he explains. “These other things in addition to money. Money is not nothing. It simply can't be the only thing.”When pressed about the three most important decisions that shape our lives—where to live, who to be with romantically, and what to do professionally—Bloom resists offering prescriptive advice. “It's very hard for me to tell you what you should care about.” Instead, he emphasizes the meta-perspective: creating space to ask these questions in the first place. “You need to stop and pause and create the space necessary to come to your own answers for them,” he insists. “That is what's important. It's not someone telling you 'here are the answers.' It's that you are given and allowed and pushed to create the space to ask them in the first place.”This approach reflects Bloom's belief that self-awareness is paramount in decision-making. But how does one distinguish between authentic desires and mimetic ones—those we've absorbed from our environment? Bloom references a conversation with his friend Derek Thompson , a writer at The Atlantic: “Do you want the job, or do you want other people to see you have this job?”He elaborates: “Would you take that job or buy that thing if no one else in the world would figure out or find out that you had it? Would you still want to do it? That's a really good way of cutting through the noise.”I also asked Bloom about the evergreen skills that will remain valuable regardless of technological advances. His answer is immediate and confident.“I think the two skills that will continue to matter no matter what are storytelling and sales,” he says. “Storytelling and sales are fundamentally everything when it comes to your life. The CEOs of the biggest companies in the world are not the smartest people at their organizations. They are the best storytellers.”This perspective challenges conventional thinking about technical expertise. “Ten years ago, you would have said software engineering is such a durable skill. Well, I could create a case where software engineering is a totally obsolete skill because of AI in ten years,” Bloom observes. “What that means is that the meta-skills are what really matter.”But how does one become a good storyteller? Per Bloom, it's about deliberate practice and acute observation. “Every single time I talk about anything, I am paying attention to the things that are making your eyes light up. I'm paying attention to the things that are making you lean in. I'm paying attention to the things where you look confused,” he explains. “Every single time you are telling your story, you should be gathering information and data to make your story even better the next time you do it.”Perhaps the most striking aspect of my conversation with Bloom is his unwavering commitment to delayed gratification. In an era of instant validation, though, his approach seems almost ancient (and wise).“I fundamentally believe that delayed gratification is the key to life,” he states with remarkable certainty. “Delayed gratification is effectively the cheat code that allows you to build the life that you want.”This philosophy manifests in his daily routine and work ethic. “If all I have to do to provide for my family is wake up at 4am every single day, I have to be able to get myself up and do that,"" he says, his voice taking on an edge of intensity. “It doesn't matter how I feel, because if I followed how it felt on a daily basis, I would never get started on anything.”This willingness to override short-term discomfort for long-term gain permeates Bloom's thinking about relationships as well. “Marriage is sacrificing short-term freedom in order to achieve long-term freedom of a fulfilling, happy life,” he observes. “That is really the fundamental trade-off that we constantly come into tension with.”In between our discussion on productivity and discipline, Bloom endorses boredom. In our hyper-stimulated world, he sees deliberate periods of non-stimulation as essential.“Create space to retreat, to pause, to create solitude for yourself,” he advises. “This is like the hidden life hack that no one talks about—that you need to have a boredom ritual in your life.”Bloom cites Pascal: “Blaise Pascal said all of humanity's problems come from the inability to sit in a room alone, and that's very true.” For Bloom, these periods of boredom aren't extensive—""probably like 15 minutes a day of true boredom”—but they're non-negotiable. “It's very uncomfortable when you first do it because you're so unused to zero stimulation. The only time you ever have zero stimulation is when you're in the shower, and it's no wonder that you have your best ideas there.”This approach to intentional boredom connects to his journaling practice, which again reflects Bloom's pragmatic nature. Rather than lengthy introspection, he employs what he calls the “1-1-1 method”: “Three minutes, and you write down one win from the day, something you feel good about; one point of stress or tension, something you're stressed about; and then one point of gratitude, something that you were grateful for during the day. Takes literally two to three minutes, and you never have an excuse to not do it.”The primary benefit? Better sleep. “I fall asleep much more quickly. I feel way less anxious when I get into bed because I got that thing off my brain and onto the paper.”Bloom also offers a perspective on relationships that aligns with his long-term thinking. “I approach every single new relationship with a question: If I were to assume that I am going to know this person for the next 50 years, how would I approach this relationship, this first meeting?”The answer reflects his non-transactional philosophy: “I wouldn't ask for anything, for sure. I would probably just try to really understand a person and start to go deep and understand who this person is, what their motivations are, what they're all about. People that approach life quid pro quo and approach things in a transactional way very rarely achieve the best outcomes in life.”His approach to maintaining relationships is similarly intuitive rather than systematic. “I don't have a CRM. I just do everything off of feel. When I think something about someone, I just send them the text, and I do it right then, because I think that inspiration around relationships is very perishable.”As our time draws to a close, I ask Bloom what people most commonly misunderstand about building a fulfilling life. His answer crystallizes the philosophy that underpins his book and worldview.“The single biggest mindset shift people need to have is to recognize that investments in all of these areas of your life compound in the same way as financial investments,” he says with particular emphasis. “We don't think that way. We don't think about investments in relationships compounding. We don't think about investments in our health or in our purpose as compounding, but they do.”This insight leads to the final one: “Anything above zero compounds. Doing a tiny bit today—sending the one text, going for the 15-minute walk—all of those things are better than doing nothing. Anything above zero compounds. That mindset will change your life.”In a world fragmented by competing metrics and definitions of success, Bloom’s approach suggests that fulfillment may lie not in the grand gestures but in small, consistent actions across multiple dimensions of wealth—actions whose value, like compound interest, becomes apparent only with the passage of time.","Sahil Bloom is an investor, entrepreneur, and author.

Buffett’s assurance on cash reserves

Big bets on Japan’s trading giants

Berkshire Hathaway’s outlook

Billionaire investor Warren Buffett has reassured shareholders regarding Berkshire Hathaway’s substantial cash reserves, signaling that the funds will be strategically deployed to fuel future growth.Addressing concerns about the company’s massive $321.4 billion cash pile, Buffett, in his annual letter to shareholders, dismissed speculations that it signals an impending economic downturn. He emphasized his plans to make significant investments, particularly in one major emerging market.Despite the growing cash reserves, Buffett clarified that Berkshire Hathaway’s focus remains firmly on equity investments. He explained that while the firm’s cash reserves have reached unprecedented levels, the majority of Berkshire’s value remains tied up in equities, with no intention to shift away from this strategy. As of the last quarter, Berkshire had refrained from stock buybacks for the second consecutive period, leading some analysts to speculate that Buffett didn’t see the company’s stock as undervalued. However, Buffett reassured that the company’s core preference for equities would not change.Buffett also revealed where some of this enormous cash reserve will be allocated. Berkshire Hathaway has already made significant investments in Japan, particularly in the country’s five largest trading houses: Itochu, Marubeni, Mitsubishi, Mitsui, and Sumitomo. These companies, known as ""sogo shosha,"" are involved in diverse sectors ranging from commodities to shipping and steel. Buffett expressed confidence in these firms, citing their strong integration into Japan’s economy and their diversified business models, which closely mirror Berkshire Hathaway’s investment philosophy.Buffett indicated that Berkshire would likely increase its stake in these companies over time, noting that they had agreed to allow Berkshire to surpass the 9.9% ownership limit previously set. By the end of 2024, Berkshire’s holdings in these Japanese trading houses had reached $23.5 billion, with the potential for further growth. Buffett’s long-term vision for these investments reflects his strategy of investing in businesses he understands and trusts.Berkshire Hathaway’s total market value surpassed $1 trillion for the first time in 2024, a milestone that Buffett attributed to the company’s culture of long-term reinvestment and compounding returns. Despite a slight decline in profits, from $96.2 billion to $89 billion, Buffett encouraged investors to focus on operating earnings, which saw a significant rise from $37.4 billion to $47.4 billion in 2023.Buffett reiterated the importance of reinvesting Berkshire’s revenues, rather than paying dividends, which has yielded substantial returns over time. He credited the success of this approach to the power of compounding and sustained savings.","Billionaire investor Warren Buffett has reassured shareholders regarding Berkshire Hathaway’s substantial cash reserves.

Pi coin surges after Open Mainnet launch: Can it reach $100 or $500 by 2030?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/pi-coin-surges-after-open-mainnet-launch-can-it-reach-100-or-500-by-2030/articleshow/118563592.cms,"Pi coin (Photo: ET)

Can Pi coin reach $100?

Will Pi Coin ever hit $500?

What’s Next for Pi Coin?

Pi Network officially launched its Open Mainnet on February 20, 2025, marking a shift from a closed ecosystem to full decentralization. The launch resulted in price fluctuations, with Pi Coin initially surging to $1.97, before dipping to $0.737, and then rebounding 80% to $1.29.As of February 24, 2025, Pi Coin is trading at around $1.55, with a 24-hour trading volume exceeding $1.18 billion.Despite still being far from the $10 mark, some crypto analysts believe Pi Coin has significant growth potential, especially if adoption increases and major exchanges begin listing it. OKX has already announced plans to enable Pi Coin trading once the network meets its listing criteria and completes a successful transition. Market experts suggest that for Pi Coin to hit the $100 mark, it will need robust demand, increased trading liquidity, and widespread adoption as a digital asset.Looking ahead, reports like those from Fortune India suggest that if Pi Network evolves into a widely accepted digital currency with real-world use cases, its price could potentially exceed $500 by 2030. However, this depends on various factors, including continuous development, mass adoption, and regulatory compliance. Analysts warn that Pi Coin's long-term growth could face challenges without strong real-world utility and developer engagement.Following its Open Mainnet launch , the focus now shifts to whether Pi Coin can maintain momentum and attract wider adoption. While this is a significant step forward, Pi Coin’s future will depend on its ability to build utility and trust among users and investors. The trajectory of Pi Coin will be influenced by how the network navigates challenges in a competitive and regulatory-heavy environment, ultimately determining whether it can surge towards $100, $500, or beyond.Disclaimer: Recommendations, views, and opinions expressed by experts are their own and do not reflect the views of The Times of India.","Pi Network officially launched its Open Mainnet on February 20, 2025.

Tesla unveils self-driving feature in China after long regulatory hurdles,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/tesla-unveils-self-driving-feature-in-china-after-long-regulatory-hurdles/articleshow/118554100.cms,"Regulatory challenges and market expansion

China’s push for self-driving innovation

Tesla began rolling out advanced self-driving features for its cars in China, marking a milestone after years of regulatory hurdles in the world’s largest automobile market.In an announcement on its WeChat page on Tuesday, the US electric vehicle giant confirmed that a software update would gradually introduce ""automatic autopilot-assisted driving on city streets.""The update also included a rearview mirror function designed to detect whether drivers are paying attention.These features are similar to Tesla’s ""full self driving"" (FSD) capability available in the United States. However, the technology does not make vehicles fully autonomous and still requires driver supervision.Tesla stated that the update had already been released for some models and would be expanded to other compatible vehicles over time.China is a crucial market for Tesla, where it operates two factories and faces increasing competition from domestic manufacturers.The announcement comes shortly after Chinese automaker BYD, Tesla’s biggest rival in the country, revealed plans to introduce advanced self-driving technology across nearly all its models.Tesla has long been working to gain regulatory approval for FSD in China, a process complicated by strict data and privacy laws. CEO Elon Musk has visited the country multiple times in past years, allegedly to secure key data security clearances for Tesla’s locally produced vehicles.Chinese automakers and tech firms have invested heavily in self-driving technology, aiming to compete with industry leaders in the US. While fully autonomous cars are not yet available for purchase, China has approved multiple self-driving taxi services in major cities.In Wuhan, more than 500 driverless taxis operate as part of Baidu’s Apollo Go project, offering rides across large parts of the city.Meanwhile, BYD’s ""God’s Eye"" autonomous driving system, previously reserved for high-end vehicles, will soon be available in budget models priced under $10,000, further increasing competition in the market.As Tesla expands its self-driving capabilities in China, it faces an increasingly dynamic landscape where local companies are rapidly advancing their own autonomous technologies.","Tesla began rolling out advanced self-driving features for its cars in China.

Dubai-based cryptocurrency exchange Bybit suffered a heavy breach after hackers gained access to a wallet containing Ethereum and stole $1.5 billion.Despite what is believed to be the largest single digital heist in history, Bybit has reassured customers that their funds remain safe. CEO Ben Zhou confirmed on social media that the company would fully refund all affected users, even if the stolen assets are not recovered.“Bybit is solvent even if this hack loss is not recovered, all of clients assets are 1 to 1 backed, we can cover the loss,” Zhou posted on X.He added that Bybit holds $20bn in customer assets and can absorb the financial hit independently or through partner loans.Bybit, the second-largest crypto exchange by trading volume, has over 60 million users worldwide.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor ( CEA ) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

Gold price prediction today: Gold rates expected to maintain positive trend in coming months,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gold-price-prediction-today-where-are-gold-rates-headed-on-september-23-2025-and-in-the-near-term-mcx-gold-outlook/articleshow/124060479.cms,"Gold price outlook: The yellow metal may rise to $3800/$3850 in the coming months. Long-term target is $4000. (AI image)

Gold rates are likely to maintain their long-term positive bias, with dips and corrections serving as buying opportunity for investors, says Praveen Singh, Senior Fundamental Research Analyst- Currencies and Commodities at Mirae Asset Sharekhan.

The analyst shares his views on gold price outlook and what levels investors should watch out for:

Gold Performance:

Spot gold closed with a hefty gain of 1.1% at $3685 on Friday as the US Fed rate cuts helped the metal regain its bullish momentum. The yellow metal recorded its fifth straight weekly gain as it was up 1.1% in the week ending September 19.

On September 22, the metal extended its rally in the expectations of further rate cuts. The rally gathered pace ahead of the newly appointed Fed Governor Miran's speech, as following his vote for a 50-bps rate cut at the FOMC meeting concluded on September 17, markets have been hopeful that he would again press for outsized rate cuts. He was the only dissenter in the September 17 monetary policy decision meeting as he also wanted to cut rates by another 1.25 percentage points at the two remaining FOMC meetings this year, as compared to the Fed's median view of lowering rates by another 50-bps.

As widely expected, on Monday, he called the Fed's rate regime too restrictive and pushed for aggressive rate cuts.

The shiny metal was changing hands at $3743, up by 1.57%, at the time of writing this report, while the MCX gold October contract at Rs 112,200 was up by nearly 2%.

Stephen Miran' speech:

Speaking on 'economic outlook' at Economic Club of New York on September 22, Miran, President Trump's appointee to the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors, said that due to sharp declines in immigration, rising tariff revenue and aging population, Fed's rate should be closer to 2.5% rather than the current 4%-4.25%. He said that series of 50-bps cuts will recalibrate policy and it is better to move to neutral more quickly than less quickly. He sees CPI rent inflation falling below 1.5% in 2027 from 3.5%. Miran estimates neutral real rate, level of rate that neither boosts nor constrains economy, to be close to zero as immigration restrictions, higher saving rates because of tariffs and the raft of tax cuts passed earlier this year have significantly lowered estimates.

Other Fed speakers are cautious though:

St Louis Fed President Musalem said on Monday that he sees limited room for more reductions, and only under certain circumstances.

Atlanta Fed President Bostic in an interview published Monday in the WSJ said that he was hesitant to declare his support for another rate cut in October meeting as he finds that inflation has been too high for too long.

Upcoming data and events:

President Donald Trump will address on the first day of high-level General Debate at the 80th UN General Assembly (UNGA) beginning on September 22 in New York. The debate runs through Sept. 29.

Ukrainian President Zelenskiy will meet Trump on the sidelines of UNGA to persuade him to join a security guarantees framework.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell will speak on the economic outlook at the Greater Providence Chamber of Commerce in Rhode Island on Sept 23.

Major upcoming US data on tap this week include S&P global US PMIs (Sep. 23), new home sales (Sep. 24), Q2 GDP tertiary (Sep. 25), PCE Price Index (September 26), real personal spending (Sept. 26) and University of Michigan inflation expectations and consumer sentiment (Sept. 26).

The Eurozone's PMIs will be out on September 23.

Gold ETF holdings:

As of September 19, total known global gold ETF holdings stood at 95.83 Moz, a fresh cycle high, and now at the highest level since May 2022.

ETF holdings have risen for four straight weeks and are up 15.66% YTD.

Fiscal turmoil in Argentina:

Argentina, which must meet about $9.50 billion in debt payments next year, is witnessing a slump in its currency Peso. The Peso has declined around 4% since September 19 as investors started pulling out of Argentina after he suffered a local election defeat on September 7, which in turn raised the stakes of for midterm congressional election in October. The US as offered all the possible help to Argentina.

US Dollar Index and US yields:

Following a 3-day winning streak, the US Dollar Index declined on September 22 and at the time of writing was seen at 97.39, down nearly .3% for the day.

Ten-year US yields at 4.13% were up by 0.14%, while 2-year yields rose by 1.5 bps to 3.586%.

Geopolitical watch:

France and other countries were set to join Australia, Britain, Portugal, and Canada in recognizing a Palestinian state at the UN general assembly in New York.

France's rating downgrade:

France's credit rating was downgraded again within a week as following a downgrade by Fitch, Morningstar DBRS, on September 20, downgraded the rating to AA from AA (high) due to a deterioration in the outlook for its public finances amid challenges posed by growing domestic political fragmentation and reduced policy consensus in recent years.

Indian Rupee under pressure:

The Indian Rupee is under pressure on concerns over H1 visa fees hike, which supports domestic gold prices per se.

Gold Price Outlook:

Gold supported by a confluence of bullish factors like Fed rate cut expectations, geopolitical concerns, and political and fiscal worries is likely to trade with a positive bias. Healthy ETF inflows also support the bullish bias.

The yellow metal may rise to $3800/$3850 in the coming months. Long-term target is $4000.

The Fed Chair Powell’s speech on September 23 could be somewhat hawkish so that constitutes a possible downside risk to gold prices.

Nonetheless, overall outlook remains positive and buy the dips remains the preferred strategy.

Support is at $3700 (MCX gold October contract Rs 110,900)/$3650 (Rs 109,400). Resistance is at $3775 (Rs 113,200)/$3800 (Rs 113,900)/$3850 (Rs 115,400).

MCX gold rates at USDINR rate of Rs 88.29.

K Visa China: US says no to foreign workers with H-1B move; China says 'K' - Will Beijing score in visa game?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-says-no-to-foreign-workers-with-h-1b-move-china-says-k-will-beijing-score-in-visa-game/articleshow/124039263.cms,"AI-generated image

H-1B Crackdown! Trump Imposes $100k Fee; Indians & Tech Giants Face Major Hit; Know All About It

A sharp contrast with US visa curbs



What's in it for India?







While US might have an upper hand in tariff war, China seems to be scoring ahead in visa game. Beijing's K visa, which is set to take effect from October 1, is being billed as a strategic tool to attract young foreign science and technology talent. The order will take affect amid the H-1B visa chaos caused by the Donald Trump administration, driving away foreign talent from working in US companies in the long-run.The K visa specifically targets graduates in STEM fields and early-career researchers with at least a bachelor’s degree from recognized institutions worldwide. Unlike China’s existing work visas, it does not require applicants to secure a local employer before applying. Holders will be able to engage in education, research, entrepreneurship, and business activities, making it an especially flexible option for young professionals and innovators, according to a report by China Briefing.The launch comes as the US tightens its immigration policies. Trump’s latest move to restrict the H-1B visa, long a magnet for skilled foreign workers, mostly Indian, has fueled concerns among international students and professionals.China, by contrast, is sending the message: qualified talent is welcome here.In fact, US categorically said that the motive behind its H-1B move was driven by cheap ""foreign labour"" replacing American workers in several fields including STEM.""Unemployment among recent computer science graduates has reached 6.1 per cent and 7.5 per cent for computer engineering graduates - more than double the rates for biology or art history majors. The number of foreign STEM workers in the United States has more than doubled between 2000 and 2019, while overall STEM employment only increased 44.5 per cent during that time,"" it said.In contrast, China's K visa specifically targets young foreign science and technology professionals, and is seen as a part of Beijing’s broader push to lower barriers for global talent and channel their skills into China’s innovation drive.US government figures show that Indians account for over 70% of the 85,000 H-1B visas granted annually, with many beneficiaries having spent decades building their lives and careers in America. The H-1B visa move would act as a deterrent for the future generations looking to go out of the country for work.With India-China relations showing signs of easing through trade and border dialogues, and both nations facing common trade friction with the US over Russian oil purchases, Indian professionals may now see new opportunities emerging in the market next door.","Beijing's K visa, which is set to take effect from October 1, is being billed as a strategic tool to attract young foreign science and technology talent.

H-1B Crackdown! Trump Imposes $100k Fee; Indians & Tech Giants Face Major Hit; Know All About It

H-1B Visas: Wall Street Banks May Increase India Talent Dependence





US President Donald Trump ’s move to steeply hike the H-1B visa fees to $100,000 in a bid to create more jobs for Americans may actually end up backfiring! Major Wall Street banks are actually expected to increase their dependence on business support centres in India after Trump’s fee hike for new H-1B visa applications.Despite Trump's intention to safeguard American employment through immigration restrictions, analysts suggest these new regulations might encourage banks to strengthen their presence in Indian technology centres like Mumbai, Bengaluru and Hyderabad, which currently provide employment to over 1.9 million individuals.H-1B visas, extensively utilised by technology sectors in India and the US for skilled foreign workers, also see significant usage from financial and consulting organisations. During the US fiscal year ending September 2023, Indian nationals constituted 72.3% of total H-1B recipients, which includes both new and renewed employment.Also Read | The $100,000 H-1B gamble: Why Donald Trump’s visa tax won’t save American jobs - winners and losers According to a Bloomberg report, leading American banks, including Citigroup Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc., are significant employers at India's global capability centres, which handle various functions from trading assistance and risk assessment to technical support.These centres, employing software engineers, quantitative analysts and accounting professionals, provide cost-effective services whilst offering access to qualified professionals who are scarce in their domestic markets.US banks maintain substantial presence in this sector, enabling potential work relocation to India to navigate new visa regulations. The workforce numbers are significant: Citigroup maintains 33,000 personnel in India, Bank of America Corp. employs over 27,000, whilst JPMorgan has 10,000 staff.""Unless new restrictions are placed on offshoring, foreign banks will lean even more on their Indian capability centers,"" Umesh Chhazzed, founder of recruitment firm Anlage Infotech, who has worked with US lenders for more than two decades was quoted as saying in the Bloomberg report.According to EY data quoted in the report, Global Capability Centres have evolved into a $64 billion industry, showing 9.8% annual growth from 2019 to 2024. These centres are expected to increase from the current 1,700 to approximately 2,500 by 2030, with projected market value reaching $110 billion.""Banks would be calibrating a new strategy for the global capability centers. It appears, there will be onshoring of jobs to India adding new job functions,"" said Abizer Diwanji, founder of NeoStart Advisors LLP, a financial advisory firm. ""However, none will jump the gun amid evolving situations. They will wait for more clarity,” he was quoted as saying.Also Read | Alternatives to H-1B visas: After fee hike by Trump to $100,000, O1 & L1 visas gain traction; check cost, approval rates Research published in the Management Science journal indicates that companies typically respond to skilled immigration restrictions by increasing overseas recruitment. The 2023 study reveals that highly internationalised companies typically employ one overseas worker for each visa application rejection.According to the report, JPMorgan has welcomed the exemption of current H-1B visa holders from the new fee. Sjoerd Leenart, the bank's Asia-Pacific executive, during a Bloomberg Television interview on Monday indicated that an evaluation of the proposed modifications was premature.According to Parvathy Tharamel, partner at Trilegal law firm, India has established itself as the foundation of global capability centres for international banks, managing essential business, compliance, technology and innovation operations.""The new H-1B restrictions will only accelerate this trend, pushing more cross-border technology and high-value roles into India hubs,"" she was quoted as saying.Nevertheless, growth initiatives might be constrained by the possibility of additional US measures affecting banks' international strategies.","H-1B visas extensively utilised by technology sectors in India and US for skilled foreign workers.

NEW DELHI: The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) on Tuesday lifted India's economic growth forecast by 40 basis points for 2025-26, citing monetary and fiscal policy easing and reforms linked to the Goods and Services Tax (GST).""In India, higher tariff rates will weigh on the export sector, but overall activity is anticipated to be supported by monetary and fiscal policy easing, including the reform to the Goods and Services Tax, with growth projected to be 6.7% in 2025 and 6.2% in 2026,"" the Paris-based OECD said in its economic outlook.In a separate report, S&P Global Ratings retained India's GDP growth at 6.5% for the current fiscal year, citing robust domestic demand.

GDP growth in the June quarter was better than we expected at 7.8%,"" the agency said in a report. The ratings agency expects China's economy to slow to about 4% year-on-year in the second half of 2025 and 2026 due to weakening exports, tepid organic domestic demand, and contained macro stimulus.

IPO-bound PhysicsWallah plans to directly lend student loans,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/ipo-bound-physicswallah-plans-to-directly-lend-student-loans/articleshow/124075024.cms,"



Edtech unicorn PhysicsWallah’s lending arm, Finz Finance Pvt Ltd, has received a certificate of registration from the Reserve Bank of India last week to operate as a non-banking finance company (NBFC), people familiar with the matter told TOI.The company had disclosed having secured RBI’s approval for the license in August, earlier this month via its updated draft red herring prospectus (DRHP) with the Securities and Exchange Board of India. The latest clearance formally allows the Noida-headquartered group to start lending directly to students, reducing its reliance on external NBFCs and banks for course financing.The shift comes as PhysicsWallah prepares for a Rs 3,820 crore initial public offering . With the license in place, the company can bring student loans and other credit-linked services under its own umbrella, giving it greater control over pricing, collections and scale.“This approval means they will no longer need to route loans through third parties. It gives them greater control over pricing, collections and scale. The company does not want to depend too much on outside lenders as it looks to expand financing for its students,” said one of the people cited above, adding that this was the key reason the NBFC license was sought ahead of the IPO.TOI’s queries on the development did not elicit a response till press time.Until now, PhysicsWallah offered installment-based financing for its courses through tie-ups with lenders. “Once a student avails a loan, the banking institution pays the tuition fees to us and collects the principal and interest payment from the student over an agreed period of time,” the company disclosed in its updated DRHP, filed with Sebi earlier this month. PhysicsWallah also runs Finz Fintech Pvt Ltd for lead generation and collection support.Over the years, PhysicsWallah has built its business around a mix of online learning, offline coaching centres and acquisitions in the test-prep space. It counts subsidiaries such as Xylem Learning in Kerala and Utkarsh Classes in Rajasthan, alongside platforms like iNeuron and PrepOnline, broadening its reach beyond its flagship NEET and JEE offerings. The company also operates offline centres under the PW Vidyapeeth brand, catering to high school and competitive exam aspirants across multiple states.The push into student lending underscores PhysicsWallah’s effort to diversify its revenue streams as it heads to the public markets. In the financial year ended March 2025, the company reported consolidated revenue from operations of Rs 2,887 crore, up from Rs 1,940 crore in FY24. Total income rose to a little over Rs 3,039 crore from Rs 2,015 crore a year earlier. Net loss for the year narrowed to Rs 243 crore from Rs 1,131 crore in FY24.","The shift comes as PhysicsWallah prepares for a Rs 3,820 crore initial public offering.

MUMBAI: Hikal shareholders have approved the reappointment of Bharat Forge vice-chairman and joint MD Amit Kalyani to the board of the chemicals company, with almost all votes cast supporting his continuation. Interestingly, his aunt Sugandha Hiremath and her family, who own about 35% of Hikal, also voted in his favour. Her action comes amid an ownership dispute between the Hiremath and Kalyani families over Hikal, where Amit and family own 34%.""Yes, there are disagreements in our family, as in many others. But these differences must remain separate from professional responsibilities. My husband built Hikal from the ground up, with the support of my father. It has evolved into a strong company over time, creating value for all involved-shareholders, employees, and partners. This vote honours that legacy, ensuring that the company he nurtured continues to thrive for generations to come. I consciously separated the personal from the professional...to me, it expresses our family's values and Hikal's spirit,"" said Sugandha, who is also the non-executive director of Hikal, explaining her family's decision to vote in favour of Amit's reappointment.Voting results show that 99.59% of votes polled supported Amit's reappointment, while only 0.14% votes were against the resolution. Also, 99.88% of votes from promoter shareholders and 0.04% from public shareholders backed Amit.If the Hiremaths had not supported his reappointment, he would not have been able to retain his board seat despite the backing of his family and public shareholders. ""The difference between those for and against the resolution would have been very slim. But they matter,"" said a chartered accountant. Amit's reappointment fell under an ordinary resolution, requiring the majority of votes polled to back his candidacy.Amit, 50, has been on Hikal's board since 2012 but plays no role in its day-to-day affairs. His continuation allows the Kalyani family to represent their ownership interests in the company. Otherwise, they would have been like other shareholders with large stakes in a company but no directorship. An example is the Pallonji Mistry family, who have no directorship in Tata Sons despite being the company's largest and long-time minority shareholder. Previously, Sugandha and her family had voted against Amit's father Baba Kalyani's board reappointment at Hikal. Baba's 31-year tenure on Hikal's board ended in Jan 2024.","Amit Kalyani has been on Hikal's board since 2012 but plays no role in its day- to-day affairs.

MUMBAI: For several small mom-and-pop stores across the country, passing on the benefits of the reduced GST cuts to the consumers immediately is becoming a challenge.For one, they have bought their stock from the distributors at the old rates and selling products to customers at lower rates would mean incurring losses, which many cannot afford. ""There are some issues on the ground. It will take 15-20 days for things to settle. For small kirana stores which do not make very large sales daily, taking a hit on their margins is not something they can afford,"" said a trader, requesting anonymity. Also, not all kirana store owners based out of smaller towns or remote areas may be aware of the changes in rates.""It might take some time for the messaging to reach them. Small shopkeepers tend to keep stock for a week only and they have fixed margins. The value of their stock is not much than a few lakh,"" said another trader, adding that shops in larger colonies are not facing much implementation issues. ""The real impact of the GST can be seen 10-15 days later,"" he said.New packs with revised prices are expected to hit the markets by mid-Oct. Firms have been actively sending circulars and communication on revised rates to distributors and retailers but it can be challenge for companies to track millions of packets of FMCG products sold by outlets across the country.""While Q2 may remain somewhat volatile due to transitional issues, we are very bullish going into Q3. The period immediately following the GST announcement usually sees some slowdown as everyone waits for the new rates and market transitions take place,"" said Godrej Consumer Products MD & CEO Sudhir Sitapati.Wipro Consumer Care CEO Neeraj Khatri said the company is monitoring the firm's channel partners to ensure that the benefits reach the last mile at the earliest. There's also some confusion among consumers too as they are seeking discounts on products where GST has not been changed, traders said.For some retailers, it is taking time to educate the sales staff and consumers on the revised rates. ""Although our IT systems are updated, we are trying to place tags in the stores detailing old and new rates to communicate it to consumers. Also, sales staff need to be trained on the new rates. It's a challenge but things should get smooth in a few days,"" said Anupam Bansal, MD at Liberty Shoes.For Godrej Appliances, the key focus currently is to ensure clear communication of the new GST rates at the shopfloor.

"Rupee hits a new low of 88.80/$, down over 3.5% in this year",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/re-hits-a-new-low-of-88-80/-down-over-3-5-in-this-year/articleshow/124078427.cms,"



MUMBAI: The rupee closed at 88.76 against the dollar on Tuesday, down 46 paise from its previous close of 88.30 - its steepest one-day fall in nearly a month. The currency opened at 88.59 and hit a day's low of 88.80. It has now lost over 3.5% this year, making it one of the weakest performers in Asia.The fall is paradoxical because it comes even as the dollar is weakening globally, with the US currency sliding against almost every major unit. This divergence is seen as temporary: analysts say the rupee is unlikely to keep sliding while the dollar index is in a broad downtrend. In fact, traders expect the rupee to recover in Oct, as both currencies cannot weaken in tandem for long.Tuesday's slide was triggered by a sharp hike in H-1B visa fees and the imposition of 50% US tariffs on Indian goods - the highest in Asia. The measures have raised concerns over India's IT sector, with technology stocks down 0.7% on the day and nearly 18% lower for the year, even as the broader market has gained 6.5%.Traders said the RBI likely stepped in intermittently to smoothen volatility but avoided defending a specific level, signalling it may allow gradual depreciation.Most banks were reported to be buying dollars, though reserves of over $700 billion provide a buffer against sharper falls.""Today saw some month-end and half-year-end outflows by general importers. While there may be some volatility in the coming days, the rupee is unlikely to weaken very sharply as the dollar is weakening against all currencies,"" said forex consultant KN Dey. ""Going forward, I expect the rupee to strengthen in Oct as you cannot have both the rupee and the dollar index weakening simultaneously.""More than a fourth of India's total forex remittances by overseas workers could be hit if the US doubles down on restrictions for Indian IT workers. Market participants see further risks if curbs on services exports widen or tariff rollbacks are delayed.Traders also noted that recent meetings between Indian ministers and the US administration have been positive, though tariffs and visa issues continue to weigh on sentiment.","The rupee closed at 88.76 against the dollar on Tuesday, down 46 paise from its previous close of 88.30.

Gold Price Outlook

Gold price prediction today: Gold prices Last week saw a blend of inflation trends & political interference which involved Fed independence risk created a wave of uncertainty, boosting safe haven appeal for gold as it continued to hit record highs.In the US, mixed inflation data, cooling labour markets, and weakening consumer sentiment kept expectations of a Fed rate cut in place. In Europe, political instability in France added to economic pressure, while the ECB held rates steady. China grappled with deflationary pressures & Japan prepared for snap elections.Other asset classes included, global equity markets ending the week higher, while US Treasury yields, & the US dollar weakened, while oil prices edged up.Gold recorded repeated all-time highs edging near to $ 3,700 per oz in the current week. Gold ETF investors continued to be heavy buyers continuing their purchase for third consecutive months with net holdings rising steadily. led by Western funds. (YTD Inflows: 472.7 tonnes inflows. Vs 6.8 tonnes outflows in 2024).In India, Gold ETFs recorded inflows of Rs 2,190 crore in August, the largest since January’s Rs. 3,751 crores.Global central banks now own more gold than US Treasuries for the first time since 1996, indicating a substantial shift in their foreign exchange holdings. Gold has already surpassed the euro as the second most important reserve asset after the US dollar. Adjusting for over four decades of inflation the spot price of gold, also surpassed its inflation adjusted peak of $ 850 set on January 21, 1980 which comes to around $3590 per oz.The current week remains most crucial for gold as the US Fed may announce its monetary policy on September 17, midnight. It is widely expected that the central bank may go ahead to slash its interest rates by 25 bps, as a slight possibility of a 50 bp cut also exists. Overall possibility of 3 rate cuts persists by the end of the year. Having said that, a summary of economic projections which includes projections on interest rate cuts to be released by the US Fed during the meeting remains crucial to be assessed for further direction in precious metal prices.Overall, a likely hawkish cut could bring in profit booking moves in prices. However, chances of any major correction lower remains' limited, as the US labour market shows signs of weakening, where major supports lie at around $ 3620 – 3570 zone (CMP $ 3685). On the higher side, prices could turn volatile in the coming session post release of Fed statement as strong upside barriers could persist at around $ 3,720 – 3,750 per oz in spot. This could translate to a level of Rs. 1,12,000 - 1,12,500 // 10 gm on MCX futures contract on a higher side on a weekly basis.","Gold recorded repeated all-time highs edging near to $ 3,700 per oz in the current week.

What is the penalty for filing a belated return?



Can I claim a refund in a belated return?



How to file ITR after the due date?





Can a belated return be revised?







The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) on Monday extended the income tax return (ITR) filing deadline for individual taxpayers by one day, from September 15 to September 16, 2025 for AY 2025-26.The extension applies to those not required to undergo an income tax audit. This deadline has not been extended further.So, what happens if one misses the deadline?Taxpayers missing the deadline can still file a belated return until December 31, 2025, but it may attract penalties and other consequences.Any ITR filed after the due date is considered a belated return and can be submitted until December 31, 2025. While filing a belated ITR allows taxpayers to comply with the law, it comes with certain limitations, including late fees and other potential consequences.Tax experts advise taxpayers to act promptly and file their ITR by September 16 to avoid unnecessary penalties and complications.Chartered Accountant Hitesh Jain, Partner – Direct Tax, N. A. Shah Associates LLP, explained that under Section 115BAC, effective from Assessment Year 2024-25, the new tax regime is the default option.Jain said, “So if a taxpayer wants to opt for the old regime, then ITR needs to be filed before the due date prescribed under Section 139(1) which is September 15, 2025 for FY 2024-25 (AY 2025-26).”This means that taxpayers without business income can select the old tax regime only through the original ITR filed on or before the due date. Jain added that deductions such as house rent allowance (HRA), home loan principal and interest under Section 80C, leave travel allowance (LTA), and others cannot be claimed if the ITR is filed after the deadline. In cases where the total tax liability is lower under the old regime, missing the September 15 deadline could lead to a higher effective tax liability.Taxpayers who miss the September 16 deadline for filing their ITR must pay a late fee of up to Rs 5,000. Those with an annual income exceeding Rs 5 lakh will be liable for a Rs 5,000 fee, while individuals earning below Rs 5 lakh will pay Rs 1,000. No late fee is charged for filing a nil belated return.A belated ITR is treated the same as a return filed on or before the original deadline when it comes to refunds. Taxpayers can claim a refund when filing a belated ITR, provided they complete all necessary bank validation and compliance requirements.One has to file an ITR after the due date (belated ITR) by logging into the ITR filing portal and then select the filing section as 139(4). The rest process is the same as filing an original ITR.Belated ITRs can be revised, but only until December 31, 2025. Any revision requests submitted after this date will not be accepted.","The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) on Monday extended the income tax return (ITR) filing deadline for individual taxpayers by one day, from September 15 to September 16, 2025 for AY 2025-26.

Kenvue stock rebounds: Tylenol maker rises 6% after Donald Trump’s autism claims; analysts see limited legal impact,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/kenvue-stock-rebounds-tylenol-maker-rises-6-after-donald-trumps-autism-claims-analysts-see-limited-legal-impact/articleshow/124074082.cms,"



Shares of Tylenol maker Kenvue rebounded sharply on Tuesday, recovering from a steep fall triggered by President Donald Trump’s unfounded remarks linking the drug to autism.At the opening bell, Kenvue shares climbed more than 6 per cent, a day after plunging 7.5 per cent, AP reported. Trump had repeatedly instructed pregnant women to avoid Tylenol during a White House press conference on Monday, also cautioning mothers against giving the drug—known as acetaminophen in the US and paracetamol in many other countries—to infants.“Don’t take Tylenol,” Trump told pregnant women around a dozen times, despite relying on older studies rather than significant new research. His comments coincided with Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a vaccine skeptic, promoting the “Make America Healthy Again” campaign, which has focused on potential causes of autism.Kenvue strongly rejected the claim, saying there is no proven link between acetaminophen and autism. The company warned that pregnant women could face “a dangerous choice” if they avoid Tylenol, potentially exposing themselves to untreated fevers or riskier alternatives.Citi Investment Research analyst Filippo Falorni told AP “limited risk of new lawsuits after Trump’s announcement” but cautioned that “there could be risk to Tylenol consumption given the negative headlines.”He expected a positive market reaction given the absence of new scientific evidence.Kenvue, spun off from Johnson & Johnson’s pharmaceutical and medical device divisions in 2023, makes Band-Aids, Listerine and other well-known brands in addition to Tylenol. The company has already faced hundreds of lawsuits over alleged ties between Tylenol and autism, but most have been dismissed.The consumer health firm’s recovery also comes in the shadow of Tylenol’s troubled history. In the 1980s, seven people in the Chicago area died after taking cyanide-laced Tylenol capsules, an incident that sparked nationwide panic and led to sweeping reforms in over-the-counter medicine packaging. No one was ever charged.","Shares of Tylenol maker Kenvue rebounded sharply on Tuesday, recovering from a steep fall triggered by President Donald Trump’s unfounded remarks linking the drug to autism.

US stock indexes slipped on Tuesday as Wall Street took a breather following a relentless rally that pushed all major indexes to record highs on Monday. The S&P 500 fell 0.5%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 69 points, or 0.2%, and the Nasdaq composite dropped 0.7% as of 1:30 p.m. Eastern time, AP reported.After surging from a bottom in April, the broad US stock market is facing criticism for rapid gains, with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell noting that stock prices “broadly look fairly highly valued.”Tech heavyweight Nvidia weighed on the market, giving back 2.7% of its previous day’s gains after announcing a partnership with OpenAI to expand data centers. AutoZone shares fell 1.2% after reporting weaker-than-expected quarterly profit margins.Boeing rose 1.8% after Uzbekistan Airways agreed to buy 14 Dreamliner airplanes, with a possibility of eight more. Kenvue climbed 3%, rebounding from Monday’s decline after President Donald Trump raised unproven concerns about Tylenol and autism; the company has disputed any link.Gold continued its record-breaking rally, topping $3,800 per ounce, up nearly 45% this year, fueled by expectations of Fed rate cuts to support a slowing US job market.Inflation worries, combined with high government debt, have also boosted demand for the safe-haven metal.Powell, speaking publicly for the first time since last week’s rate cut, reiterated that the Fed faces a unique challenge as job market concerns rise while inflation remains stubbornly above 2%. Fed officials have signaled potential additional rate cuts, but caution that lower rates may exacerbate inflation.US Treasury yields ticked lower, with the 10-year yield easing to 4.12% from 4.15% late Monday. Preliminary reports indicate US business activity is growing but at a slower pace, as tariffs raise costs for companies unable to fully pass them on to customers, according to S&P Global.Markets abroad were mixed: France’s CAC 40 rose 0.5%, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng fell 0.7%, and Japan remained closed for a holiday.","The S&P 500 fell 0.5%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 69 points, or 0.2%, and the Nasdaq composite dropped 0.7%.

China’s internet watchdog has moved against two major platforms, Bytedance owned news app Jinri Toutiao and Alibaba’s internet browser company UCWeb, accusing them of spreading harmful material. The move was announced on Tuesday, a day after Beijing launched a two-month campaign to tighten control over online content.The Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) said on Monday it would crack down on material that fuels “malicious incitement of conflict” or encourages “negative outlooks on life such as world-weariness”.Authorities in Beijing already require social media firms to heavily police their platforms, keeping out anything they judge subversive, pornographic, vulgar or otherwise damaging.This month, the CAC had already penalised three well-known sites, Weibo, Kuaishou and Xiaohongshu, for what it called poor oversight of content. The regulator has not disclosed what punishment they faced.Toutiao, the news app came under fire for allowing “harmful content” to appear on the main page of its trending searches. The CAC said the company had failed in its duty to manage information properly and in doing so had “damaged the online ecosystem”.Actions taken against the firm include “summoning the company for a meeting, ordering rectification within a specified time limit, issuing a warning, and strictly dealing with those responsible”. No further details were released.“Internet regulators will continue to focus on prominent illegal and non-compliant activities that undermine the online ecosystem,” the CAC said in its statement cited by AFP.Alibaba’s UCWeb also faces sanctions. The CAC accused the browser service of posting entries linked to “extremely sensitive and malicious” issues, citing subjects such as “online violence and the privacy of minors”.The two-month campaign, launched on Monday, will target a wide range of online behaviour. The regulator said the drive is designed “to regulate the malicious incitement of conflict and the promotion of violence and vicious currents”.It also wants to stamp out attempts to exploit trending events by “forcibly associate identity, region or gender with other information, stigmatising and hyping them.”","Bytedance owned news app Jinri Toutiao and Alibaba’s internet browser company UCWeb accused of spreading harmful material.

Low oil prices pose challenges



Renewable energy outlook







US President Donald Trump’s tariffs are creating uncertainty into the global economy, impacting investment decisions more than supply chain costs, said Shell India’s Robin Mooldijk, president of projects and technology.“The primary effect is on our supply chain. It becomes more expensive and for a company like Shell it's something that we could actually deal with,” Mooldijk said.“But the bigger (effect) is even on the investments. Does it change the business climate and the supply-demand balance to the extent that—a little bit cheaper or a little bit more expensive project, doesn't really matter—do we want to do it or not,” he added, as quoted by ET.He noted that Shell’s global chemicals business has seen demand impacts, with the speed of recovery remaining uncertain.Shell continues to face low oil prices, with crude trading below $70 per barrel and forecasts predicting sub-$60 levels next year due to a supply glut.“We have an incredibly resilient upstream portfolio,” Mooldijk said. “So, while (low oil price) hurts, it doesn't hurt fundamentally at that level where we have to disappoint shareholders.”In India, Shell operates an LNG terminal in Gujarat, a small fuel retail chain, and the renewable energy platform Sprng Energy. Most of its 13,000 Indian employees work in Global Capability Centres (GCC) in Chennai and Bengaluru.Chennai hosts Shell’s global monitoring centre for assets worldwide.“(It) allows us to optimize across different assets. Because typically if assets are on a different continent, they don't really talk to each other. But now you see that there's similar work done by people sitting next to each other for different assets,” Mooldijk said.Bengaluru houses one of Shell’s three key global R&D hubs. “Bangalore for me is probably the key to commercialisation of technology,” he added, highlighting Shell’s Changemakers of Tomorrow initiative, which brings together startups, academics, suppliers, and industry executives to foster energy innovation.Mooldijk emphasised that Shell’s India presence is no longer just about cost efficiency.“It may have started off a long time ago as cost efficiency. We're so way beyond that. We reached the point that we cannot do without our presence in India and the same applies to our IT organisation,” he said, as quoted by ET.Shell is collaborating with Indian universities and suppliers to develop frugal technologies that enhance competitiveness.While some global oil companies have scaled back renewable ambitions due to market challenges, Shell continues to develop technology for sustainable energy.“It's the market that drives how fast we go. The will is there and especially on technology development, we will continue to develop, but we still need to have a market,” Mooldijk said. “If nobody buys it, what are you going to do with it?”On green hydrogen, he cautioned that price parity with conventional hydrogen is unlikely this decade.“It currently costs about five times more and would require fundamental technological breakthroughs to achieve a steep cost reduction,” Mooldijk added.","US President Donald Trump’s tariffs are creating uncertainty into the global economy. “The primary effect is on our supply chain.

Mixed signals from Federal Reserve



Currency and commodity markets







Asian share markets looked set to extend recent gains on Tuesday, driven by strong investor optimism around artificial intelligence (AI) and tech stocks, while bets on further US interest rate cuts pushed gold to fresh record levels.Wall Street had reached another record after Nvidia announced it would invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI, with the first data centre equipment expected in the second half of 2026.""With US tech/AI currently in red-hot form, we'd need to see something leftfield to derail the upbeat flows that are the driving force of Oracle, Apple, Nvidia, Tesla, and some of the US hardware plays,"" said Chris Weston, head of research at broker Pepperstone, as quoted by Reuters.Weston noted that the seemingly inexorable rise in tech has been attracting money from momentum funds and options traders, becoming almost self-fulfilling. Investors are also hedging their exposure to equities by buying gold, which hit a fresh record of $3,755.47 per ounce, up nearly 9% so far this month.The tech rally has boosted chip sectors across Asia. South Korean stocks rose 0.2%, having surged almost 9% this month, while Taiwan climbed nearly 7%.Japan’s Nikkei was closed for a holiday but has risen 6.5% in September. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.3%, up 5.5% for the month. Chinese blue chips edged up 0.1%.European equities have generally lagged behind the tech surge. EUROSTOXX 50 futures gained 0.1%, FTSE futures rose 0.1%, and DAX futures added 0.2%. S&P 500 and Nasdaq futures were largely unchanged after reaching new peaks overnight.Equities globally have been underpinned by expectations of further rate cuts from the Federal Reserve following last week's easing. Futures indicate roughly a 90% chance of a quarter-point cut in October and a 75% probability of another cut in December.Markets remain dovish despite mixed messaging from the Fed. Speaking on Monday, new Fed Governor Stephen Miran, handpicked by US President Donald Trump, argued for sharply lower rates, while three colleagues stressed the need for caution on inflation. Fed chair Jerome Powell is scheduled to speak later Tuesday on the economic outlook and policy.Treasuries have also been supported by expectations of lower short-term rates, even as markets brace for a large government and corporate debt issuance this week: $69 billion in two-year notes on Tuesday, followed by $70 billion in five-year notes and $44 billion in seven-year paper. Investors are also watching the September 30 US government funding deadline.In currencies, the dollar eased after three consecutive sessions of gains. The euro remained steady at $1.1809, rebounding from a $1.1726 low on Monday, while the dollar slipped to 147.68 yen from a high of 148.37. Sweden’s crown held at 9.3497 per dollar ahead of a central bank meeting, where futures imply about a one-in-three chance of a rate cut.Oil prices were restrained as concerns of oversupply outweighed geopolitical tensions in Russia and the Middle East. Brent crude eased 0.2% to $66.46 a barrel, while US crude dipped 0.1% to $62.21 per barrel.","Asian share markets look set to extend recent gains, driven by strong investor optimism around artificial intelligence (AI) and tech stocks.

Singapore firm rejects $1 billion Sri Lankan pollution damages,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/singapore-firm-rejects-1-billion-sri-lankan-pollution-damages/articleshow/124059210.cms,"



SINGAPORE: A Singapore shipping company told AFP on Tuesday it will refuse to pay Sri Lankan court-ordered damages of US$1 billion for causing that country's worst case of environmental pollution.In an exclusive interview, X-Press Feeders chief executive Shmuel Yoskovitz said he believed paying would have wide-ranging implications on global shipping and ""set a dangerous precedent"".The company operated the MV X-Press Pearl that sank off Colombo Port in June 2021 after a fire -- believed caused by a nitric acid leak -- that raged for nearly two weeks.Its cargo included 81 containers of hazardous goods, including acids and lead ingots, and hundreds of tonnes of plastic pellets.The ship was refused permission by ports in Qatar and India to offload the leaking nitric acid before it arrived in Sri Lankan waters.Tonnes of microplastic granules from the ship inundated an 80-kilometre (50-mile) stretch of beach along Sri Lanka's western coast. Fishing was prohibited for months.Sri Lanka's Supreme Court in July ordered the company to pay Colombo an ""initial"" US$1 billion in damages within a year, with the first tranche of US$250 million to be paid by Tuesday.It also ordered the company ""to make such other and further payments"" in the future as the court may direct.'Hanging guillotine'Yoskovitz rejected the open-ended nature of the penalty.""We are not paying because the whole base of maritime trade is based on the limitation of liability. This judgment undermines this limitation of liability,"" he told AFP.""Any payment towards the judgment could set a dangerous precedent for how maritime incidents will be resolved in the future,"" he said.Yoskovitz said the absence of limitations could lead to higher insurance premiums, which would be ultimately passed on to consumers.The chief executive again apologised for the incident, saying the company recognised the disaster and was trying to make amends.He said X-Press Feeders had already spent $170 million to remove the wreck, clean up the seabed and beaches, and compensate affected fishermen.""We are not trying to hide... We are willing to pay more, but it has to be under certain marine conventions and an amount that is full and final and then it can be settled, and we can move on,"" he said.""But to live under this hanging guillotine -- it is simply impossible to operate like this.""Long-term effectsIn Colombo, Sri Lanka's Supreme Court has scheduled a hearing on Thursday about the implementation of its decision.One of the petitioners who sought compensation for the pollution has called for further research to determine the full extent of the damage to the island's marine ecosystems.""If you visit the coastlines today, there is nothing visible in terms of plastic pollution. A major clean-up took place soon after the X-Press Pearl incident, but the effects of the pollution will be felt for a long time,"" said Hemantha Withanage from the Centre for Environmental Justice.It remains unclear how Sri Lanka's Supreme Court could enforce its decision.However, in its 361-page decision in July, the court ordered the police and the state prosecutor to initiate criminal proceedings for non-compliance if the parties were present in Sri Lanka.Yoskovitz expressed concern over the ship's Russian captain, Vitaly Tyutkalo, who has been banned from leaving Sri Lanka for more than four years, as well as the company's third-party agents there.The firm had offered to pay a fine for the skipper's release, but this was refused, according to Yoskovitz.X-Press Feeders obtained an order from London's Admiralty Court in July 2023, limiting its liability to a maximum of 19 million pounds (US$25 million), but Sri Lanka has challenged that.The Sri Lankan government also filed a lawsuit against the ship's owners in the Singapore International Commercial Court. But that has been stayed pending the result of the case in London, with a pre-trial hearing expected in May 2026.","Sri Lanka's Supreme Court in July ordered the company to pay Colombo an ""initial"" US$1 billion in damages within a year.

"The $100,000 H-1B gamble: Why Donald Trump’s visa tax won’t save American jobs",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/the-100000-h-1b-gamble-why-donald-trumps-visa-tax-wont-save-american-jobs-winners-and-losers/articleshow/124050520.cms,"AI image for representation only.

TL;DR: Driving the news

TACO Storm: MAGA Torches Trump Over $100K H-1B Fee Backtrack, Calls Him ‘Weak’

The Financial Times estimated US employers could face $14 billion in added costs annually under the plan.

Why it matters

The H-1B program, created by Congress in 1990, is the main gateway for highly skilled immigrants, particularly in STEM fields. It supplies engineers, computer scientists, doctors, and professors to US companies and universities.

The sudden shock of a $100,000 barrier risks:

Disrupting tech and healthcare workforces that already face shortages.

Forcing companies to offshore projects to India, Mexico, or Canada.

Weakening US universities’ appeal, since foreign students often stay on through H-1Bs.

Rutgers economist Jennifer Hunt told the Wall Street Journal: “This misguided measure could shut down the H-1B program entirely. And if that happens, it’ll have a very detrimental effect on the economy as a whole.”

The big picture

A 2015 paper by economists Giovanni Peri, Kevin Shih, and Chad Sparber found influxes of foreign-born workers raised wages for US-born workers.

A 2023 study by economist Britta Glennon showed that when H-1B immigration is restricted, US multinationals simply shift jobs abroad.

George Mason University’s Michael Clemens told WSJ: “H-1B visas cause innovation, they cause entrepreneurship, they cause more R&D investment. They cause higher productivity in the whole US economy, which generates job opportunities and higher earnings for native workers.”

Between the lines:

Who’s affected most

Tech giants: Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft, and Apple employ thousands of H-1B holders. A $100,000 fee could drive them to expand offshore capability centers instead of hiring in the US.

Companies most dependent on US based employees with H-1B visas

Universities and hospitals: Nonprofits rely heavily on H-1Bs for professors, researchers, and physicians. Immigration lawyer Karin Wolman told Bloomberg: “The intended effect is to make the H-1B unreachable for entry-level professionals … The impact on health care alone will be devastating.”

Startups and smaller firms: Many can’t afford a six-figure visa bill, leaving them shut out of the global talent market.

India’s role: Indians account for about 70% of H-1B visas.

The whole idea is, no more will these big tech companies or other companies train foreign workers. … If you’re going to train somebody, you’re going to train one of the recent graduates from one of the great universities across our land. Commerce secretary Howard Lutnick

What they are saying

Proponents: Trump told reporters in the Oval Office, “We’re having people come in, people that in many cases are very successful or whatever, as opposed to walking over the borders.”

MAGA activists blasted him for softening the measure by making the fee one-time instead of annual. One fumed on X: “This isn’t miscommunication. Trump chickened out yet again.”

Critics: Nasscom, India’s IT industry body, warned the move could disrupt business continuity and cause “ripple effects on America’s innovation ecosystem.”

Workers: At San Francisco airport, immigrants rushed home after companies urged staff to return before the fee deadline. “It’s quite tragic. We have built a life here,” one engineer told Reuters.

Zoom in: MAGA backlash

The $100,000 fee didn’t go far enough for some of Trump’s supporters. MAGA hardliners mocked him with the nickname “TACO” - Trump Always Chickens Out — after the White House clarified the fee would be a one-time charge and apply only to new visas after March 2026.

Activists demanded the fee extend to renewals and transfers.

Some want to dismantle OPT (Optional Practical Training) and L-1 visas, which allow student graduates and corporate transferees to work in the US.

David Frum, a former George W Bush speechwriter, warned the backlash reveals a deeper American pessimism: “The people behind Maga are people who are not optimistic about the future of the United States. Maga is strongest where America is least competitive.”

The reverse brain drain

India’s tech sector is already preparing to welcome back H-1B talent. Analysts say the new policy could turbocharge growth in global capability centers (GCCs) in India, Canada, and Mexico, where US firms are shifting strategic work.

“The ‘American Dream’ for aspiring workers will be tough,” said Ganesh Natarajan, former CEO of Zensar Technologies. “I expect firms to restrict cross-border travel and get more work done out of India, Mexico and the Philippines.”

Indian startups see an opportunity. Manav Garg, founder of Together Fund, told the Economic Times: “Right now, AI is the gold rush. Many of them may launch startups or join as early employees. That is a massive talent shift.”

A Nasscom-S&P report noted Indian IT firms already employ 207,000 people in the US and generate $396 billion in US sales output. Sending skilled professionals back home could tilt global innovation further east.

What’s next

Immigration lawyers say the proclamation is vulnerable to lawsuits because fees must reflect processing costs and go through public comment. “It was timed to create pandemonium,” Karin Wolman, a New York-based lawyer, told the NYT. “No one else will be able to afford it - startups, small companies, nonprofits, universities, hospitals.”

Sophie Alcorn, CEO of Alcorn Immigration Law, told Reuters she expects “several lawsuits will be immediately forthcoming this week.”

Legal challenges could slow or overturn the policy. Courts have struck down past attempts to raise H-1B wage thresholds.

Congressional pressure: Some Republicans quietly worry the crackdown could hurt US competitiveness. But MAGA-aligned lawmakers want Trump to go further.

Business adaptation: Tech firms and universities may accelerate offshore hiring, automation, or near-shoring to Mexico and Canada.

Talent shift: If the fee survives, expect a sharper “ghar wapsi” wave - Indian engineers leaving the US to build startups at home.

The bottom line





American President Donald Trump’s proclamation to impose a $100,000 fee on new H-1B visas has jolted corporate US, global talent, and many immigrant communities – particularly Indian-Americans. Rolled out with little warning, the six-figure charge is meant to curb what Trump and his allies call the “most abused visa” and force tech giants to hire American workers instead.But economists, immigration experts, and industry leaders say the move is more likely to backfire - slowing US innovation, pushing jobs overseas, and accelerating a talent shift back to India.H-1B visas have long been a political lightning rod. Critics argue companies use them to replace Americans with lower-paid foreigners. Proponents point to decades of research showing they boost wages and productivity for native workers by spurring innovation.Many H-1B workers go on to found startups, file patents, and create jobs. Others teach, work in hospitals, or support US universities through research.Denying them entry—or pricing them out—may give American tech workers a brief reprieve. But in the long run, it’s a surefire way to stifle the innovation ecosystem that supports the entire economy, the WSJ report said.The new fee could accelerate a “reverse brain drain”: skilled engineers returning to India and fueling its AI and SaaS boom.“Trump’s $100,000 H-1B fee is economic suicide for America,” Vivek Wadhwa, a former fellow at Harvard Law School, told the TOI . “It will force Indian talent to go home … driving innovation out of the US and handing India an economic gift.”Trump’s $100,000 H-1B fee might win applause from immigration hardliners, but the economic evidence suggests it won’t protect most American workers. Instead, it risks exporting US jobs, draining talent, and undermining competitiveness - while giving India’s tech sector an unexpected boost.(With inputs from agencies)","The H-1B program, created by Congress in 1990, is the main gateway for highly skilled immigrants, particularly in STEM fields.

US stocks slipped on Monday as Wall Street took a breather following a string of record highs last week. The S&P 500 dipped 0.2%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 228 points, or 0.5%, and the Nasdaq composite eased 0.1% as of 9:35 a.m. Eastern time, AP reported.All three indexes had hit fresh all-time highs on Friday.Market analysts noted the pullback is modest compared with the surge since April, driven by optimism that President Donald Trump’s tariffs will not disrupt global trade and expectations that the Federal Reserve will continue cutting interest rates to support the US economy. The Fed made its first rate cut of the year last week and signalled additional cuts may follow this year and into 2026.“Every time the market seems to be running out of momentum, it fools most of us by pushing to higher heights,” said Jay Woods, chief market strategist at Freedom Capital Markets.Investors remain wary that the Fed may not cut rates as many times as expected, with inflation staying above the 2% target. An update on Friday will show the Fed’s preferred inflation measure, with economists anticipating a slight acceleration for August.Stocks are also seen as expensive by many professional investors after recent gains.Among notable movers, Coinbase Global fell 3.8% but remains up nearly 33% for the year amid strong interest in cryptocurrencies.Corporate deal activity lifted some stocks: Pfizer agreed to buy Metsera, a development-stage obesity drugmaker, in a deal valued at $4.9 billion, potentially rising by nearly 50% if regulatory approvals and milestones are met.

US social security 2026: COLA rises slightly; what does this mean for retirees’ take-home pay?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-social-security-2026-cola-rises-slightly-what-does-this-mean-for-retirees-take-home-pay/articleshow/124048849.cms,"2026

cost-of-living adjustment

(COLA) provides limited relief





Disabled and low-income Americans are facing increasing obstacles in accessing Social Security benefits, a report scheduled for release next month finds. Advocates warn that changes under the Trump administration--including staff reductions, updated phone systems, and policy tweaks--have made high-touch support harder to obtain, raising risks of food insecurity, housing instability, and mental health crises.The research, conducted by California State University, Sacramento; University of Wisconsin-Madison; and State University of New York, Binghamton, draws on interviews with 14 benefits specialists, attorneys, and other advocates who assist multiple claimants, according to US-based news portal Axios. The findings highlight difficulties in navigating Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and disability benefits, particularly for those without reliable internet access.“Every time I went to the appointment, they said it's only for 10 minutes,” said F. Johnson. She described efforts to restore SSI benefits for her 19-year-old disabled grandson, noting little success until legal counsel intervened. Advocates report similar experiences nationwide, with short office visits and rerouted calls frustrating claimants.SSI recipients include nearly 900,000 individuals with intellectual disabilities, 800,000 autistic or developmentally disabled people, and 350,000 living with schizophrenia.Recipients cannot hold more than Rs2,000 ($24) in the bank, and the rules for reporting changes to the SSA are complex. Barton Mackey, press officer at the SSA, said, “The commissioner recently named a dedicated executive to lead SSI, a first for the agency, bringing a heightened focus on reducing complexity and easing the ability for recipients to report changes. ”The agency has implemented electronic verification of wages and assets to reduce claimant burden and improve payment accuracy. Customer satisfaction data indicates that nearly 90% of callers were satisfied or beyond satisfied. Commissioner Frank Bisignano noted that most interactions occur online: “We do 1.5 trillion transactions on the web a day and only 130,000 visitors to our field office.”Despite these improvements, advocates say navigating the system remains challenging. “Processes have become not easier, but much harder,” a Denver-based benefits specialist noted. Legal Services of Philadelphia attorney Jen Burdick reported clients losing payments, facing eviction notices, or becoming homeless, highlighting the stakes for low-income beneficiaries.Adding to the financial pressures, Social Security’s 2026 cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) is projected at 2.7–2.8%, slightly above the 2.5% increase in 2025. For the average retiree receiving Rs2,008 ($24,000 annually), this translates to roughly Rs54 ($0.64) per month. Rising Medicare Part B premiums, projected to increase by Rs21.50 ($0.25) monthly, will reduce the net gain to around Rs32–33 ($0.38), limiting the benefit of the COLA increase.Other 2026 changes include increasing the full retirement age to 66 years and 10 months for those born in 1959, raising the taxable wage base, and adjusting earnings thresholds for retirees under full retirement age.Financial planners advise retirees to factor in rising healthcare and prescription drug costs when budgeting and to consider supplemental income sources to preserve long-term stability. While the COLA offers some relief, systemic barriers in accessing SSI and disability benefits remain a pressing concern for millions relying on Social Security as a lifeline.The SSA will announce the final 2026 COLA in mid-October along with Medicare premium adjustments. The upcoming research report will provide further insight into the obstacles facing disabled and low-income beneficiaries, highlighting a system under strain even as modest adjustments offer limited financial relief.","Advocates warn that changes under the Trump administration have made high-touch support harder to obtain.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021.

How India's GDP has been growing

What SBI report said on savings and investment

Incremental capital output ratio

NEW DELHI: India's gross domestic product (GDP) data for the third quarter (October-December 2022) received a word of caution from the former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan In an interview with news agency PTI, Rajan that India is ""dangerously close"" to the Hindu rate of growth in view of subdued private sector investment, high interest rates and slowing global growth.India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying"".However, a report released by the State Bank of India (SBI) economists on Tuesday dismissed arguments that India is dangerously close to Hindu rate of growth saying such statements are ""ill-conceived, biased and premature"".The term 'Hindu growth rate' was coined by late economist Raj Krishna in 1978 to describe the slow growth in the country.It basically refers to the low pace of economic growth rates during 1950s to 1980s. During this period, the Indian economy averaged 3.5%.A former lecturer at the Delhi School of Economics (DSE), Krishna noted that only if the rate of growth is persistently slow and accompanied by low per-capita GDP, then it will be known as Hindu rate of growth but it has to factor in population growth as well.Before economic reforms of 1991, India's economic growth remained stagnant and low, while per capita income averaged around 1.3%. Krishna termed this low growth situation to be a result of socialist policies of state control and import substitution.However, the economic situation changed when liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation (LPG) reforms came into effect in the year 1991, at a time when India faced balance of payment crisis.Over the years, many economists have strongly opposed the idea of 'Hindu growth rate' and the term never had universal acceptance.The Indian economy plunged into its very first technical recession in FY21 due to the impact of Covid-19 pandemic and the related nationwide lockdowns. GDP shrunk by an unprecedented 23.8% in the first quarter of the financial year 2020-21. However, due to spurt in economic activities in the subsequent quarters, the GDP decline started to narrow.However, if we look at the period before Covid-19 as well, India's growth curve shows a declining trend.From 8.26% in FY17, GDP growth plunged to 3.74% in FY20. Shutdown of economic activities in FY21 in wake of Covid-19 only made matters worse.As lockdowns started to ease and business activities resumed, India's GDP also started rising. In Q1 of FY22, growth jumped to 20.1% mainly on account of low base effect. By the fourth quarter of FY22, growth came down to 4.10%.Similarly, the new financial year 2022-23 brought fresh economic challenges in the form of Russia-Ukraine war that impacted almost all major economies of the world, slowed the pace of growth, pushed inflation to record highs.As a result, the central banks of all advanced economies spurred into action and opted for monetary policy tightening to curb the soaring inflation.With persistently rising interest rates, India's economy grew by 4.4% in Q3 of FY23, as the Centre revised upwards GDP growth for previous year to 9.10% from 8.7% earlier.The report weighed recent GDP numbers against the available data on savings and investments for the past decade and highlighted some interesting points.""Quarterly growth numbers are noisy and should be best avoided for any serious interpretation (on an average, India's GDP growth has witnessed Rs 2 lakh crore upward revision for the 3 year ended FY23),"" the report said.Gross capital formation (GCF) by the government touched a high of 11.8% in 2021-22, up from 10.7% in 2020-21.""This also had a domino effect on private sector investment that jumped from 10 per cent to 10.8% over the same period,"" it said.In fact, Ecowrap added that the trends in GCF to gross output ratio or the plough back of funds for creation of fresh capacity shows that for public administration the ratio attained fresh peak in 2021-22 owing to the emphasis on capital expenditure in recent budgets.At the aggregate level, gross capital formation is supposed to have crossed 32% in 2022-23, the highest level since 2018-19.According to the report, in 2021-22, gross savings have risen to 30% from 29% in 2020-21.""The ratio is supposed to have crossed 31 per cent in 2022-23, the highest since 2018-19. The household savings increased sharply during the pandemic period on account of sharp accretion in financial savings such as deposits,"" said the report by SBI's Economic Research Department.While household financial savings have since then moderated from 15.4% in 2020-21 to 11.1% in 2022-23, savings in physical assets have grown sharply to 11.8% in 2021-22 from 10.7% in 2020-21.The report further analysed Incremental Capital Output ratio (ICOR) -- which measures additional units of capital (investment) needed to produce additional units of output. It said that the ratio has been improving.""ICOR which was 7.5 in FY 12 is now only 3.5 in FY22. Clearly, only half of capital is now needed for next unit of output,"" the report noted.Such reducing ICOR in the current years reflects a relatively increasing efficiency of capital and shows that the economy is on a sound footing, the report said.""From that point of view, future GDP growth rates even at 7% could still mean a decent number by any standards!,"" it added.","India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%. Raghuram Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying""","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-98483158,imgsize-65724,width-400,resizemode-4/98483158.jpg"

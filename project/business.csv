At 9:16 AM, Nifty50 was trading at 25,862.30, up 72 points or 0.28%.

Trump’s weaponisation of tariffs has already impacted global trade and particularly countries which have been targeted with penal tariffs.

The charges leveled against the Fed chief Jerome Powell is an example of the fact that Trump will go against anyone who doesn’t fall in line.This unprecedented, unstable, unpredictable behaviour of the US president will continue to weigh on markets. From the Indian market perspective, the necessity of a US-India trade agreement was evident yesterday when the market bounced back sharply when the US ambassador Sergio Gor declared that the US is determined to have a trade agreement with India and the talks will resume as early as January 13th.

The positive momentum reflected a broader shift in investor focus beyond US-centric risks.In currency markets, the dollar remained under pressure on Tuesday after the Trump administration initiated a criminal probe into Powell, an action that has reignited worries over the Federal Reserve’s independence and raised fresh questions about confidence in US assets.Foreign portfolio investors were net sellers of Indian equities to the tune of Rs 3,638 crore on Monday, while domestic institutional investors provided support by purchasing shares worth Rs 5,839 crore.",Nifty50 and BSE Sensex opened in green on Tuesday.

Vaidya also lost his brother-in-law and two young nieces in the incident, AP reported.Jury selection in the case is expected to begin on Monday, with opening statements likely on Tuesday afternoon or Wednesday, according to court proceedings.“It is hard to believe that my entire family was wiped out in an instant incident in such a horrific way,” Vaidya said in a statement published on the website of his attorneys at Clifford Law Firm. “I still cry and my wife, Hiral, still cries when we think of the horror of the last moments of our loved ones’ lives.”The Vaidya family, which lived in Canada, was travelling to Kenya, the homeland of Kosha Vaidya, at the time of the crash.Relatives of Vaidya’s brother-in-law and nieces had filed a separate lawsuit against Boeing, which was settled out of court in July 2025.The Ethiopian Airlines crash followed a similar fatal accident involving a Lion Air 737 MAX aircraft in Indonesia in October 2018.

US in trouble? Trump flags financial risks if SC strikes down tariffs; trillions in repayments at stake,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-in-trouble-trump-flags-financial-risks-if-sc-strikes-down-tariffs-trillions-in-repayments-at-stake/articleshow/126495260.cms,"Representative image (AI-generated)

US President Donald Trump on Monday warned that Washington could face severe financial repercussions if the Supreme Court rules his sweeping global tariffs illegal. The warning comes as the country’s top court prepares to hear the high-stakes case this week.In a post on Truth Social, Trump wrote: “If the Supreme Court rules against the United States of America on this National Security bonanza, we're scre***!”The nation's apex body is expected to issue rulings as early as January 14, though it does not announce in advance which cases will be decided. The challenge to Trump’s tariffs has emerged as a major test of presidential authority and could have wide-ranging implications for the US and global economy.Trump’s warning comes amid legal scrutiny of tariffs imposed under the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), which he invoked by declaring a national emergency over the US trade deficit.During oral arguments in November, a majority of judges had expressed skepticism about whether the law allows a president to impose broad global tariffs without congressional approval.In his Truth Social post, Trump said the financial exposure would go far beyond tariff revenues already collected.He argued that if the court rules against the government, the US could be forced to repay “many Hundreds of Billions of Dollars” in tariff revenue, along with additional claims tied to private investments made to avoid the levies.“The actual numbers that we would have to pay back if, for any reason, the Supreme Court were to rule against the United States of America on Tariffs, would be many Hundreds of Billions of Dollars and that doesn’t include the amount of “payback” that Countries and Companies would require for the Investments they are making on building Plants, Factories, and Equipment, for the purpose of being able to avoid the payment of Tariffs. ” Trump wrote.“When these Investments are added, we are talking about Trillions of Dollars! It would be a complete mess, and almost impossible for our Country to pay,” Trump further wrote.He rejected suggestions that refunds could be handled quickly, saying the process would be complex and drawn out.“Anybody who says that it can be quickly and easily done would be making a false, inaccurate, or totally misunderstood answer to this very large and complex question. It may not be possible but, if it were, it would be Dollars that would be so large that it would take many years to figure out what number we are talking about and even, who, when, and where, to pay,” his post read.According to government data, the federal government collected roughly $200 billion more in tariff revenue in 2025 as a result of Trump’s import duties. Tariffs are paid by companies when they bring goods into the US. More than half of that revenue has come from tariffs imposed under IEEPA.Trump has repeatedly argued that the tariffs strengthened US manufacturing and boosted investment.Lower courts have already ruled against the administration. A federal appeals court in August upheld a finding that Trump exceeded his authority by imposing global tariffs under emergency powers.The case now before the Supreme Court was brought by a group of businesses and 12 US states, most of them governed by Democrats, who argue that only Congress has the constitutional power to impose taxes and that IEEPA does not mention tariffs.Opponents also dispute whether trade deficits qualify as a national emergency. At the November hearing, Justice Amy Coney Barrett observed that any refund process could become a “complete mess,” a phrase Trump later echoed.Trump has said he is preparing a “Game 2 plan” to pursue his tariff agenda if the court rules against him, though he has acknowledged that alternative legal routes would be slower, according to USA Today.A ruling against the tariffs would deal a major blow to one of the centrepieces of his domestic and trade policy and could reshape US relations with key trading partners, including the European Union, Japan, South Korea, the UK and India.","US President Donald Trump on Monday warned that Washington could face severe financial repercussions if the Supreme Court rules his sweeping global tariffs illegal.

Gold shines amid uncertainty

Asian share markets rose on Tuesday, led by a strong rally in Japanese stocks as investors bet on technology and AI-led growth. At the same time, uncertainty over the independence of the US Federal Reserve lifted gold prices and pressured the dollar.Japan’s Nikkei index surged after reopening from a holiday, jumping 3.4% to record highs as a weaker yen and expectations of fiscal stimulus lifted sentiment. Gains in Japan helped push regional markets higher, with South Korean and Taiwanese stocks also touching all-time peaks, while Chinese blue-chip shares climbed to a four-year high.MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.8% to a fresh record. In Europe, EUROSTOXX 50 futures gained 0.2%, Germany’s DAX futures added 0.1%, while FTSE futures were flat, according to Reuters.Analysts said that enthusiasm around artificial intelligence continued to support global equities.“We see global equities continuing to climb in 2026, targeting around 10% upside for the MSCI AC World by year-end,” Citi analysts said, while cautioning that high valuations leave little room for disappointment if earnings fall short.US stock futures edged lower ahead of key inflation data, with S&P 500 futures down 0.2% and Nasdaq futures off 0.3%. Markets are awaiting the December US consumer price index, with forecasts pointing to core inflation rising to 2.7%, though some expect a higher reading of 2.8%.The US earnings season also begins this week, with major banks including JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Bank of America due to report.Bank executives are expected to face questions over President Donald Trump ’s call for a one-year cap on credit card interest rates at 10% starting January 20. Banks have warned such a move could restrict access to credit for millions of households and small businesses.Investors were wondering how the US Justice Department’s criminal investigation into Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell could affect markets. Analysts fear the Fed may be pushed to keep interest rates too low for too long, increasing the risk of higher inflation later.The uncertainty weighed on the dollar, with the dollar index stuck near 98.88 after falling over 0.25% overnight. The euro edged up to $1.1665, while the dollar slipped against the Swiss franc.The dollar was steadier against the yen at 158.40, even as Japan’s currency hovered near multi-year lows. Japan’s finance minister Satsuki Katayama said she had raised concerns about the yen’s one-sided weakness with US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.Gold rose as investors felt uncertain, climbing above $4,600 an ounce for the first time before falling slightly.“Gold serves as a catch-all, and a default hedge of last resort for fear and uncertainty given its reputation as a safe haven and store of value, the fact that it is non-debaseable, and is no one else's liability,” said Christopher Louney, a gold strategist at RBC Capital Markets.Louney added that the prices could rise as high as $5,200 by the end of the year.Oil prices also climbed, reaching seven-week highs on concerns that unrest in Iran could disrupt supplies. Brent crude rose 0.5% to $64.19 a barrel, while US crude gained 0.5% to $59.81. Adding to tensions, Trump warned that any country doing business with Iran would face a 25% tariff on its trade with the United States.","Japan’s Nikkei index surged after reopening from a holiday, jumping 3.4% to record highs.

NEW DELHI: Centre’s gross direct tax collections went up 4.1% to Rs 21.5 lakh crore, dragged down by sluggish growth in income tax, where govt had offered significant concessions in the last budget.During the financial year up to Jan 11, non-corporate tax, as govt refers to income tax, was 1.2% higher at Rs 10.6 lakh crore, according to the latest data released by the Central Board of Direct Taxes. Corporation tax increased 7.7% to around Rs 10.5 lakh crore during this period.Refunds were, however, 16.9% lower at Rs 3.1 lakh crore with a 25% fall in the case of non-corporate tax (to Rs 1.3 lakh crore) and a 10% decline for corporate tax (Rs 1.8 lakh crore).On a net basis, collections were 8.8% higher at nearly Rs 18.4 lakh crore. “A 9% net collection growth is encouraging and seems to indicate that govt may be on track to achieve the yearend target. However, it is on the back of significantly lower refunds being released to both corporate and individual taxpayers. Exact details of why the trends on refunds diverging significantly from previous year are not very apparent,” said Rohinton Sidhwa, partner at Deloitte India.","During the financial year up to Jan 11, non-corporate tax, as govt refers to income tax, was 1.2% higher at Rs 10.6 lakh crore.

Three banks appeal relief granted to Anil Ambani,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/three-banks-appeal-relief-granted-to-anil-ambani/articleshow/126495112.cms,".

MUMBAI: Three banks on Monday appealed against interim relief granted to industrialist Anil Ambani last month by a single-judge bench of the Bombay high court. The judge had restrained the lenders from taking action against Ambani’s accounts based on a forensic audit report (FAR) of 2020.The HC, had in Dec, agreed with Ambani’s contention that the FAR 2020 report essentially flouts a 2024 master direction issued by Reserve Bank of India on “fraud risk management in commercial banks”. Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, representing one of the banks in the appeal hearing before the HC division bench of Chief Justice Shree Chandrashekhar and Justice Gautam Ankhad, argued that unless the order is stayed, it would lead to “disastrous” consequences.Mehta submitted that the findings recorded by Justice Milind Jadhav were not based on facts pleaded in the suit filed by Ambani or argued in court during the hearing of his plea for interim relief. He also argued that “the RBI master circular of 2024 has been given a retrospective effect, which is patently impermissible”.The audit report points to findings on facts, including that funds “were misused” and “siphoned off”, Mehta submitted in his submissions online from Delhi, adding that Ambani never challenged the FAR on merits.The report by an external auditor was under a 2016 RBI circular, which was complied with, was the banks’ case.Ambani’s counsel earlier argued that the 2024 RBI master directions mandatorily superseded the earlier 2016 directions and require an “external auditor” appointed for forensic audits to be an auditor under the Companies Act.","Three banks on Monday appealed against interim relief granted to industrialist Anil Ambani.

Ensure Chinese carmakers don’t take EU FTA route to India: BMW,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/ensure-chinese-carmakers-dont-take-eu-fta-route-to-india-bmw/articleshow/126495087.cms,".

TOI.

NEW DELHI: BMW has cautioned that Chinese carmakers may use the India-EU trade agreement to enter the domestic market and has asked govt to ensure checks to avoid possible misuse while suggesting that cars only above a certain threshold be allowed to take advantage of the proposed deal.“The apprehension is if small cars start coming into India, then they will spoil existing investment. The cost of production is very high in other countries. I don’t think we will be able to ever match the pricing in India. But if there is still any apprehension, they can always put a cap of, let’s say, cars above 20,00030,000 euros (over Rs 21 lakh). That is possible, which can help the luxury car buyer without really impacting small buyers. The second important thing is to make sure that the Chinese do not circumvent this… it’s very important that this part is taken care of,” BMW Group India president and CEO Hardeep Singh Brar toldIndian carmakers are wary of Chinese electric vehicle players entering India through the “backdoor” and have petitioned govt to have checks under the trade pact, which is in the final stages of negotiation. They have suggested a high price threshold, limited quotas and high level of value addition be prescribed under the trade pact with the European Union.Brar said BMW will be pushing EVs and has lined up 10 new products this year, of which six will be new models and four would be upgrades in the existing portfolio. Three of the new products planned will be EVs.The company plans to offer EVs at near price parity with internal combustion models and focus on long-wheelbase cars. “A combination of electrification and a long wheelbase is what really helped us,” he said.Underlining the need for strengthening the EV and luxury market, Brar said charging infrastructure was the most critical gap and suggested the PPP route to install and maintain chargers.","BMW has warned that Chinese carmakers may use the India-EU trade agreement to enter the domestic market.

Cigarette tax hike: Experts warn of surge in illicit trade; fear major revenue losses for government,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/cigarette-tax-hike-experts-warn-of-surge-in-illicit-trade-fear-major-revenue-losses-for-government/articleshow/126334324.cms,"Representative image

A sharp increase in taxes on cigarettes, along with a new excise duty structure on tobacco products, could trigger a surge in illicit trade and lead to significant revenue losses for the government, experts have warned.Earlier this week, the finance ministry notified amendments to the Central Excise Act, introducing a fresh excise duty ranging from Rs 2,050 to Rs 8,500 per 1,000 cigarette sticks, depending on their length.The new excise duty, which comes into effect from February 1, will be levied in addition to the existing 40 per cent Goods and Services Tax ( GST ).This change implies an overall tax hike of around 60–70 per cent, varying by cigarette length, compared with the current overall tax incidence of about 50–55 per cent.The move marks a transition from the GST compensation cess to an excise-based regime for demerit goods.The unexpected nature of the tax increase has raised concerns about higher smuggling and illegal trade in tobacco products.According to news agency PTI, Ranganath Tannir, secretary general of Think Change Forum, said the steep rise could prove counterproductive. “Public finance theory is clear that excessive taxation of inelastic goods fuels illicit trade, not compliance,” he said, adding that cigarettes in India are already among the least affordable globally based on World Health Organization affordability indicators.Making them more expensive is unlikely to curb demand, but could push consumers towards illegal and smuggled products, undermining tax collections, he noted.Brokerage reports have echoed similar concerns. According to JPMorgan’s Asia Pacific Equity Research, a higher tax rate for the King Size Filter Tip (KSFT) segment increases the risk of consumers downtrading to cheaper options and may also lead to higher consumption of illicit cigarettes.Illicit tobacco already accounts for about 26 per cent of India’s total tobacco market, making the country the fourth-largest market globally for smuggled tobacco, PTI reported.Nomura, in its research note, said that while higher taxes are aimed at reducing consumption, they often have unintended consequences. “High taxes on cigarettes… fuel the growth of illicit cigarettes and push consumers towards cheaper, non-tax paid smuggled cigarettes,” the brokerage said.Jefferies, citing a report by the Tobacco Institute of India (TII), said the industry body has urged the government to review the proposed excise structure.A wider gap between legal and illegal prices could benefit non-duty-paid cigarettes and result in higher tax leakage, the report noted.Experts also pointed to international experience to underline the risks. Australia’s repeated tobacco tax hikes between 2012 and 2020 led to a sharp rise in cigarette prices and were followed by a jump in illicit tobacco consumption from under 2 per cent to around 14 per cent of the market.Calling the proposed excise levies “unprecedented”, an analyst said there is still time to reassess the decision before it comes into force.“Since they take effect from February 1, 2026, the government has an opportunity to revisit and rectify them before they spawn a much larger problem of uncontrollable illicit networks,” the analyst warned, as per PTI.","The finance ministry notified amendments to the Central Excise Act, introducing a fresh excise duty ranging from Rs 2,050 to Rs 8,500 per 1,000 cigarette sticks. The new excise duty, which comes into effect from February 1, will be levied in addition to the existing 40 per cent Goods and Services Tax.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126334411,imgsize-878401,width-400,resizemode-4/untitled-design-11.jpg"

Trump Ignites WW3 Over Greenland? Denmark PM Warns Of ‘Decisive Moment’ As NATO ‘Readies’ Troops

: US President Donald Trump is on the warpath against Venezuela, Cuba, Iran, Greenland -- and the Federal Reserve. In a move that has rattled financial markets and political circles alike, the Trump administration’s Justice Department has launched a criminal investigation into Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, marking an unprecedented clash between the executive branch and the nation’s central bank.The probe, confirmed late Sunday by Powell himself, centers on statements he made during June testimony before the Senate Banking Committee about cost overruns on a long-running renovation of the Federal Reserve’s headquarters in Washington, DC, which Trump has characterized as a scandal. This development comes as the President has repeatedly expressed frustration with the Fed's reluctance to slash interest rates, a policy he claims is stifling economic growth.The investigation, which Powell says began with grand jury subpoenas served to the Federal Reserve, threatens the chair with potential criminal charges—a move he described in a video message as “unprecedented” and a threat to the independence of the Federal Reserve. He insisted that the subpoenas are being used as a tool of political pressure, not because there is credible evidence of wrongdoing.The controversy has its roots in a multi-year project to renovate the nearly 90-year-old Marriner S.Eccles Building and adjacent offices, a project first approved by the Fed’s board in 2017. Originally projected to cost about $1.9 billion, the current estimate stands near $2.5 billion, reflecting inflation, supply chain disruptions, asbestos abatement, and unforeseen construction challenges.Trump, who appointed Powell in 2018 and whose second term began in January 2025, has repeatedly assailed the Fed for its refusal to cut interest rates as aggressively as he desires. Lower interest rates are widely popular with investors and borrowers because they reduce borrowing costs and can stimulate economic growth—a key element of Trump’s economic strategy. But the Fed, tasked with controlling inflation and maintaining long-term economic stability, has kept rates at levels it deems appropriate given lingering inflationary pressures.Trump’s criticism of Powell intensified over the renovation costs after he took office last January. He has publicly derided the project as excessive and has even joked about firing Powell over it—though legally, the Fed Chair can only be removed “for cause,” and not at the president’s whim.Powell, in turn, has corrected the president’s public statements about the project’s costs, noting that Trump has, on occasion, overstated figures or conflated unrelated expenditures. Trump himself is splurging up to $ 400 million – from an initial estimate of $ 200 million – on a new ballroom attached to the White House, which critics say is over-the-top.The criminal inquiry was reportedly authorized last November by US. Attorney Jeanine Pirro, Trump’s appointee in the District of Columbia, and involves a review of Powell’s public testimony and internal spending records. Officials familiar with the matter say prosecutors have contacted Fed staff seeking documents related to the renovation.The legal escalation has galvanized lawmakers across party lines, including some from the GOP. Republican Senator Thom Tillis, a member of the Senate Banking Committee, vowed to block all Fed nominations—including Powell’s potential successor, possibly Trump surrogate Kevin Hassett—until the investigation concludes, warning that the move undermines both Fed and Justice Department independence. Some Democratic lawmakers and economists have drawn parallels to historical assaults on central bank autonomy, cautioning that politicizing the Fed could erode market confidence and destabilize the broader financial system.Markets reacted swiftly. US. stocks fell sharply, with the S&P 500 sliding more than 1 percent on Monday before recovering, as investors grappled with the uncertainty. The US dollar weakened, and gold prices surged to record highs above $4,600 an ounce, a traditional safe haven during times of institutional stress. Analysts warn that any perceived encroachment on the Fed’s independence could inject long-term volatility into stocks, bonds, and currencies.Supporters of the investigation, particularly among segments of Trump’s political base, argue that Powell should be held accountable if he indeed misled Congress or mismanaged federal resources. Conservative commentators have characterized the central bank as an unaccountable “fourth branch” of government, and some have cheered Trump’s willingness to challenge it.But critics—ranging from mainstream economists to former Treasury officials—say the probe risks undermining the very foundation of US monetary policy. The Federal Reserve’s independence, established by law and respected by both Democratic and Republican administrations for decades, is widely credited with enabling policy decisions insulated from short-term political pressures. Eroding that independence could complicate efforts to tame inflation or respond to future recessions, with repercussions across the globe.Powell, whose term as Fed Chair is set to expire in May 2026, has vowed not to resign and to continue fulfilling the Fed’s dual mandate: price stability and maximum employment. “Public service sometimes requires standing firm in the face of threats,” he said, defiantly pushing back against Trump.As Washington wrestles with this extraordinary confrontation between the executive branch and a cornerstone of the economic establishment, investors and policymakers alike are watching closely. What began as a dispute over interest rates and construction costs has ballooned into a national debate over institutional independence, democratic norms, and the future of US. economic governance.","The Justice Department has launched a criminal investigation into Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.

Netflix deal: Paramount Skydance sues Warner Bros Discovery; seeks disclosure on $82.7 billion deal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/netflix-deal-paramount-skydance-sues-warner-bros-discovery-seeks-disclosure-on-82-7-billion-deal/articleshow/126488675.cms,"Donald Trump Attacks $72B Netflix–WBD Deal, Demands CNN Be ‘Sold Or Included’ In Mega Merger

Paramount Skydance on Monday sued Warner Bros Discovery seeking greater disclosure on its proposed $82.7 billion deal with Netflix, escalating a high-stakes battle for control of one of Hollywood’s most storied media groups.The David Ellison-led company also said it plans to nominate directors to the Warner Bros Discovery board and prepare a proxy contest, marking one of its most aggressive moves yet to persuade shareholders that its hostile $30-per-share all-cash bid is superior to Netflix’s $27.75-per-share cash-and-stock offer.In a letter to shareholders, Paramount said it would also propose an amendment to Warner Bros Discovery’s bylaws requiring shareholder approval for any separation of the company’s cable television business, a central component of the Netflix transaction.The lawsuit, filed in Delaware Chancery Court, seeks to compel Warner Bros Discovery to disclose how it valued the Netflix deal, the planned spin-off of its Global Networks assets and any associated debt transfers. Paramount said shareholders cannot make an informed decision without those details.“WBD has provided increasingly novel reasons for avoiding a transaction with Paramount, but what it has never said, because it cannot, is that the Netflix transaction is financially superior to our actual offer,” Paramount wrote in a letter to Warner Bros Discovery shareholders.“Unless the WBD board of directors decides to exercise its right to engage with us under the Netflix merger agreement, this will likely come down to your vote at a shareholder meeting,” it added.Paramount said last week that the proposed cable spin-off was virtually worthless and reiterated its amended $108.4 billion offer after another rejection by the Warner Bros Discovery board. The revised proposal includes $40 billion in equity personally guaranteed by Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, the father of Paramount chief executive David Ellison, and $54 billion in debt.In a separate press release, Paramount said Warner Bros Discovery’s refusal to engage left shareholders as the ultimate decision-makers. “Over the last few days, following the decision by Warner Bros. Discovery (‘WBD’) not to engage with Paramount on our $30 per share cash offer to acquire all of WBD… we keep getting the same question: what happens next?” the company said.It added that it would nominate a slate of directors at Warner Bros Discovery’s 2026 annual meeting and, if necessary, seek votes against approval of the Netflix transaction.“Paramount will propose an amendment to WBD's bylaws to require WBD shareholder approval for any separation of Global Networks... to ensure that you get the final decision on which offer is better for you,” the release said.Paramount argues that its all-cash bid offers greater certainty and fewer regulatory hurdles than the Netflix deal, which involves a combination of cash, Netflix shares and a planned spin-off of cable assets. It has also pointed to the weak performance of Versant, Comcast’s cable spin-off, as evidence that such transactions destroy shareholder value.Shares of Warner Bros Discovery were down 1.5 percent in early trading, while Netflix rose 0.8 percent and Paramount gained 0.3 percent. Netflix and Warner Bros Discovery did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Warner Bros Discovery, which owns HBO, CNN and Warner Bros Studios, is prized for its film and television assets and extensive content library, including the Harry Potter and DC Comics franchises.

Trump vs Powell: What’s the fuss about?

Why are markets wary?

US President Donald Trump ’s fresh attack on the Federal Reserve seems to have revived the ‘Sell America’ sentiment in the stock market and strategists and market experts are warning that the selloff may deepen over time if the tiff between the government and the central bank snowballs.Market sentiment turned cautious on Monday as a growing ‘Sell America’ narrative gained traction following intensified criticism of the Federal Reserve by the Trump administration, reviving worries about the central bank’s independence in determining interest rates.The dollar, Treasury bonds and US equity futures all edged lower. Although the moves were modest, the renewed focus on the Fed’s autonomy and its broader implications for financial markets unsettled investors.US Fed Chair Jerome Powell said on Sunday evening that the central bank had received grand jury subpoenas from the Justice Department linked to his testimony before Congress regarding renovation work at the Fed’s headquarters. The episode marks another flashpoint in a series of confrontations that have included attempts to remove Governor Lisa Cook and repeated demands for sharp interest rate cuts.Trump has repeatedly urged the Federal Reserve to reduce interest rates more aggressively to stimulate growth and lower government borrowing costs.In contrast, Fed policymakers have remained cautious, citing inflation risks. Paul Volcker, appointed Fed chair in 1979, is widely credited with taking tough measures to rein in inflation, a problem many believe had been allowed to worsen after the central bank yielded to pressure from then President Richard Nixon.Speaking to NBC News on Sunday, Trump said he was unaware of any Justice Department investigation involving the Federal Reserve.Hebe Chen, senior market analyst at Vantage Global Prime Pty., said the investigation involving Powell currently appears to be “more smoke than fire,” though she cautioned that its durability remains uncertain. “The longer-term and more deeply embedded consequences could be far more significant,” she added.At the heart of investor unease is the extent to which the US president can, or should, exert influence over monetary policy, an area that has largely remained shielded from political intervention for decades. This has revived questions over whether global investors should scale back exposure to US assets and the dollar, echoing concerns that swept markets last April after President Donald Trump announced blanket tariffs.“Any development that raises questions about the Fed’s independence adds uncertainty around US monetary policy,” said Gary Tan, portfolio manager at Allspring Global Investments, which manages more than $600 billion in assets according to a Bloomberg report. “This is likely to reinforce existing trends of diversification away from the dollar and increase interest in traditional hedges such as gold.”According to Bloomberg, Ian Lyngen, head of US rates strategy at BMO Capital Markets wrote in a note: To characterize the events as putting the Fed independence discussion into uncharted waters would be an understatement. We remain skewed toward higher yields in the near-term.Market strategists cautioned that the recent decline could intensify if political and policy frictions worsen. JPMorgan Asset Management highlighted the possibility of a sharper steepening in the US Treasury yield curve, where longer-dated yields rise faster than short-term rates, driven by expectations of deeper interest-rate cuts.Lombard Odier warned that both the dollar and Treasuries could face sustained pressure, while Invesco Asset Management noted that assets outside the US, including European and Asian equities, appear relatively more attractive.“This is a bad time to be worrying about Fed independence for the market,” said Bhanu Baweja, chief strategist at UBS Investment Bank, who added that US inflation is expected to pick up in the months ahead. “The one common theme for this year seems to be not just a weaker dollar, but equity volume going higher,” he was quoted as saying by Bloomberg.The latest developments risk reviving the “Sell America” theme, according to Gerald Gan, chief investment officer at Singapore-based Reed Capital Partners. He said the situation reflects an administration intent on rebuilding public support ahead of the midterm elections, even if that comes at the cost of weakening institutional credibility.US financial assets have faced similar pressure before. Last year, markets were jolted after President Donald Trump unexpectedly unveiled sweeping global tariffs, triggering sharp volatility.The subpoena involving the Federal Reserve adds to concerns that US assets are losing appeal, said David Chao, global market strategist at Invesco Asset Management, which manages over $2 trillion. He argued that the US is not only retreating behind what he described as “Fortress America” policies, but is also adopting a more aggressive stance that unsettles investors.Others urged restraint, noting that the dollar’s entrenched status as the world’s primary reserve currency, the depth and liquidity of the Treasury market, and the artificial intelligence-driven momentum in equities could limit the downside and even create buying opportunities. “Independence is always a concern, but we will monitor developments and respond once the economic implications become clearer,” said Marvin Loh, senior macro strategist at State Street in Boston.Even so, pressure linked to the ‘Sell America’ narrative is unlikely to fade.",US President Donald Trump’s fresh attack on the Federal Reserve seems to have revived the ‘Sell America’ sentiment in the stock market.

Why Trump is pressuring the Fed



Economists warn of risks to Fed independence



The US Justice Department’s threat to criminally indict Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has triggered a fresh confrontation between the White House and the central bank, intensifying concerns over the Fed’s independence and the direction of US monetary policy.The subpoenas, served on Friday, relate to Powell’s June testimony on the $2.5 billion renovation of Federal Reserve buildings, including its Washington headquarters, AP reported. Powell has said the legal action is a pretext aimed at forcing the Fed to comply with President Donald Trump ’s demand for sharp interest rate cuts.“I have carried out my duties without political fear or favor, focused solely on our mandate of price stability and maximum employment,” Powell said in a video statement on Sunday night. “Public service sometimes requires standing firm in the face of threats.”Markets reacted negatively on Monday, with US stocks falling after Powell disclosed the subpoenas.Trump has repeatedly criticised Powell over the past year for resisting aggressive rate cuts, arguing that inflation is no longer a threat and that lower rates are needed to support growth. Powell, however, has maintained that inflation remains elevated, partly due to the impact of Trump-era tariffs, and has favoured a cautious policy approach.The conflict reflects a deeper dispute over how much influence the White House should have over monetary policy. Powell’s current term as Fed chair ends in May, but he could remain on the Fed’s board until January 2028, a move that would prevent Trump from immediately filling another vacancy.Asked whether Powell planned to stay on as a Fed governor, Kevin Hassett, director of the White House National Economic Council and a potential candidate to succeed Powell, said he was unaware of Powell’s intentions.“I’ve not talked to Jay about that,” Hassett said.Trump had earlier signalled his intent to escalate the confrontation, telling reporters in late December that his administration would “probably” sue Powell over the renovation costs.“He’s just a very incompetent man,” Trump said. “But we’re going to probably bring a lawsuit against him.”The legal action has drawn sharp criticism from economists and former policymakers, including several who previously led the Federal Reserve.A bipartisan group of former Fed chairs and top economists said on Monday that the White House’s actions amounted to “an unprecedented attempt to use prosecutorial attacks to undermine” the central bank’s independence.“This is how monetary policy is made in emerging markets with weak institutions, with highly negative consequences for inflation and the functioning of their economies more broadly,” the statement said. “It has no place in the United States whose greatest strength is the rule of law, which is at the foundation of our economic success.”The statement was signed by former Fed chairs Ben Bernanke, Janet Yellen and Alan Greenspan, along with former Treasury secretaries Henry Paulson and Robert Rubin.Republican Senator Kevin Cramer of North Dakota, a frequent Powell critic, also expressed discomfort with the criminal probe.He said he does not believe Powell is “a criminal” and added that he hopes “this criminal investigation can be put to rest quickly,” according to CNBC.Powell, who has largely avoided public confrontation since Trump began attacking him last year, said the subpoenas were intended to undermine the Fed’s ability to set policy independently and described them as a “pretext” to force interest rate cuts.The episode marks one of the most direct challenges to the Federal Reserve’s autonomy in modern US history, with implications for markets, borrowing costs and the broader economy, according to analysts.",US Justice Department threatens to indict Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.

The US dollar weakened against major currencies such as the euro and Swiss franc amid concerns that the Federal Reserve’s independence in setting interest rates to control inflation could be under pressure.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 432 points, or 0.9 per cent, as of 9:35 am Eastern time, while the Nasdaq composite was nearly flat.The market reaction followed developments over the weekend in which the US Department of Justice subpoenaed the Federal Reserve and threatened a criminal indictment over Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s testimony regarding renovations at the central bank’s headquarters.In an unusual video statement released on Sunday, Powell said his testimony and the renovations were being used as “pretexts” for the threat of criminal charges, which he described as “a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the President.”President Donald Trump, in a brief interview with NBC News on Sunday, said he was unaware of the investigation into Powell. Asked whether the probe was intended to pressure the Fed chair on interest rates, Trump said, “No. I wouldn’t even think of doing it that way.”Powell’s term as chair ends in May, and Trump administration officials have indicated that a potential successor could be named as early as this month. Trump has also sought to remove Fed Governor Lisa Cook.The Federal Reserve and the White House have been locked in a public feud over interest rates, with Trump repeatedly calling for deeper rate cuts to stimulate borrowing and economic growth. While the Fed cut its benchmark rate three times last year and has signalled the possibility of further reductions this year, it has moved cautiously — prompting Trump to label Powell “Too Late.”The Fed has long operated independently of political influence, a structure designed to allow it to take difficult and sometimes unpopular decisions, such as keeping rates high to rein in inflation, even at the cost of slower growth.On Wall Street, financial stocks were among the biggest losers after Trump separately proposed a one-year cap of 10 per cent on credit card interest rates, a move that could dent profitability for card issuers. Capital One Financial fell 6 per cent, while American Express dropped 4 per cent.In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year US Treasury edged up to 4.19 per cent from 4.18 per cent late Friday.Overseas, stock markets were mostly higher. European equities rose broadly, while Asian markets advanced sharply, with Hong Kong gaining 1.4 per cent and Shanghai climbing 1.1 per cent after reports that Chinese leaders were preparing additional measures to support economic growth.","The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 432 points, or 0.9 per cent, as of 9:35 am Eastern time.

Data from 2025 suggests those concerns were only partly true. While the cost of some imported goods, including beef, coffee and tomatoes, rose sharply, overall price increases remained broadly steady. The labour market, however, weakened noticeably, CNN reported.Average monthly job growth in 2025 was the lowest seen in decades outside recessionary periods. The December jobs report, released on Friday, showed the unemployment rate rising by 0.4 percentage points over the year to 4.4%.Hiring had already begun to slow before 2025, but Trump’s wide-ranging tariffs, and the repeated changes to them, added to the pressure. Faced with uncertainty over future trade policy, many companies froze recruitment plans, while some moved to reduce their workforce.“There’s no compelling reason to be out there hiring en masse,” said University of Central Florida economist Sean Snaith. “That is a rational response when you’re dealing with this kind of uncertainty.”Tariffs have also reshaped business decisions around investment and profitability. “Companies are seeing higher prices, depressing profitability; and in terms of new investment, they’re hesitant because tariffs make a lot of investments that have been profitable unprofitable,” Dean Baker, senior economist at the Center for Economic and Policy Research told CNN.Demand has softened as well, with customers delaying purchases amid shifting tariff levels. The Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond noted in its latest Beige Book that several manufacturing contacts “said that their customers reduced new orders due to uncertainty about tariffs.”Confusion has not been limited to consumers. Trump’s unpredictable trade moves have left many firms unsure how to respond. So far, many have chosen to absorb higher tariff costs rather than pass them on, helping to prevent a broader rise in inflation, CNN reported.That balance could shift depending on the outcome of a major Supreme Court case that may overturn Trump’s most significant tariffs. If the levies are struck down, companies could be entitled to substantial refunds for duties already paid, though resolving such claims could take considerable time.",US President Donald Trump introduced a fresh round of tariffs a year ago.

Who benefits most from the COLA



What about people still working?



Why Social Security now moves $1.6 trillion a year



Why Americans still call it a “stimulus”



When the first Social Security cheques of 2026 start landing on January 14, nearly three-quarters of the US will experience a familiar but quietly consequential ritual. A new cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) kicks in, lifting monthly benefits in line with inflation. For 2026, that figure is 2.8 percent. On paper it looks like a solid raise. In reality, much of it is being eaten away by healthcare costs and taxes.Here is what is really going on inside America’s $1.6 trillion retirement system.Roughly 75 million Americans receive Social Security or Supplemental Security Income (SSI). Every January, their benefits are adjusted using an inflation formula based on the CPI-W index. For 2026, that adjustment was set at 2.8 percent, slightly higher than last year’s 2.5 percent.For the average retired worker, this means about $56 more per month, pushing the typical cheque to around $2,071. Married couples on dual benefits will average about $3,208. SSI recipients see their federal maximum rise to $994 for individuals and $1,491 for couples. That is the headline. The lived reality is less generous.The purpose of COLA is to stop inflation from eroding purchasing power. But inflation does not hit seniors evenly.A much larger share of older Americans’ spending goes on healthcare, which has been rising faster than general prices. In 2026, Medicare Part B premiums rise sharply, and for most retirees this increase is automatically deducted from their Social Security cheques.For a typical beneficiary, roughly $18 of the $56 COLA disappears immediately just from the Medicare hike. Higher-income seniors pay even more through income-related Medicare surcharges.On top of that, many retirees also have federal income tax withheld from their benefits if they still work, draw pensions, or have other income. So while the gross cheque rises, the take-home increase is often far smaller.Social Security no longer arrives on one single day. Payments are staggered by birth date.For January 2026, the schedule looks like this:People who receive both SSI and Social Security, or who started benefits before May 1997.Those born 1st to 10th of any month.Born 11th to 20th.Born 21st to 31st.SSI follows a different calendar. Because January 1 was a holiday, most SSI recipients already received their January payment on December 31, 2025.Nearly all payments now go by direct deposit or Direct Express card, with paper cheques almost entirely phased out.Because COLA is percentage-based, people with larger existing benefits get much bigger increases in dollar terms.Someone receiving $1,200 a month gains about $34.Someone receiving $3,000 a month gains about $84.At the very top end, the maximum Social Security benefit for someone retiring at age 70 rises to $5,181 per month in 2026. To qualify for that, a worker must have earned at or above the taxable wage cap for 35 years. That cap is now $184,500, meaning more income is being taxed to support the system.Many retirees are no longer fully retired.In 2026, people collecting Social Security but not yet at full retirement age can earn up to $24,480 before benefits are reduced. Above that level, $1 is withheld for every $2 earned.That higher limit gives working seniors more room to supplement their income without losing too much of their cheque.Behind these monthly deposits sits one of the largest financial systems in the world. In 2026, the Social Security Administration is projected to pay out around $1.6 trillion across retirement, disability and SSI benefits.That scale explains why even a modest-sounding 2.8 percent COLA carries enormous fiscal weight, and why Washington keeps raising the taxable wage base and tightening rules around higher-income beneficiaries.Technically, this is not a stimulus. It is an inflation adjustment written into law decades ago.But for tens of millions of Americans who depend on Social Security as their primary or sole income, January’s COLA-boosted payment behaves exactly like one. It determines whether rent gets paid, whether prescriptions are filled, and whether grocery bills can be met.In 2026, that “stimulus” arrives on time, with a modest bump. How much of it actually reaches people’s wallets after healthcare costs and taxes take their share is another matter.","The first Social Security cheques of 2026 start landing on January 14.

‘On its way to US’: Trump makes big claim on Venezuela oil; says ‘yes’ to 50 million barrels worth $4.2bn,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/on-its-way-to-us-trump-makes-big-claim-on-venezuela-oil-says-yes-to-50-million-barrels-worth-4-2bn/articleshow/126474150.cms,"Oil Tankers Flip Trump’s Game? Venezuela’s ‘Dark Mode’ Fleet TRICKS US, Then Comes Back. Here’s Why

Washington is working “along really well” with Venezuela, US President Donald Trump said on Sunday (local time), pointing to oil shipments from the country. Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One, Trump was talking about US's approach towards the new leadership in Caracas after Nicolas Maduro was captured by American forces. “Venezuela is really working out well. We're working along really well with the leadership, and we'll see how it all works out,” he said.The US President further added that the acting President of Venezuela, Delcy Rodriguez, asked US if they could ""take 50 million barrels of oil."" ""I said, 'yes, we can' — that's $4.2 billion, and it's on its way right now to the United States,” Trump further added highlighting the scale of the deal.This comes as the Trump administration is pushingimed at claiming control over Venezuelan oil production and sales. Earlier this week, the president invited oil executives to the White House and pressed them to move quickly into Venezuela, saying the administration was seeking around $100 billion in private investment to revive the country’s oil industry and fully tap its large reserves.Trump said that Washington had seized tankers carrying Venezuelan oil and would now take over the sale of between 30 million and 50 million barrels that had previously been under sanctions, with the US controlling sales globally for an indefinite period.In the meeting with oil industry leaders, Trump told executives, “You have total safety.” “You’re dealing with us directly and not dealing with Venezuela at all. We don’t want you to deal with Venezuela.”He stressed that the expected investments would come from private companies rather than public funds. “Our giant oil companies will be spending at least $100 billion of their money, not the government’s money. They don’t need government money. But they need government protection,"" Trump said.According to the president, security assurances would be provided through cooperation with Venezuelan leaders and their people, rather than the deployment of US troops, although he added that companies would “bring over some security.”Trump also acknowledged the risks involved, noting that oil executives were accustomed to operating in challenging environments, even as Venezuela remains vulnerable to economic collapse.The White House meeting came shortly after US forces seized a fifth tanker in the past month linked to Venezuelan oil. The seizure reflected the administration’s determination to take control of Venezuela’s oil exports, refining and production, signalling continued US involvement in the sector as it pushes for firm investment commitments from private companies.","US President Donald Trump says Washington is working ""along really well"" with Venezuela.

US President Donald Trump said that he may bar ExxonMobil from operating in Venezuela, criticising the oil giant after its leadership questioned the viability of investing in the country after the capture of former president Nicolas Maduro by US forces.Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One on Sunday as he departed West Palm Beach, Florida, Trump said he was unhappy with the company’s stance. “I didn’t like Exxon’s response,” he said. “They’re playing too cute.”The remarks came days after Trump met oil executives on Friday in an effort to calm industry concerns about Venezuela. During the meeting, he told companies that any engagement would be handled directly with the United States rather than through the Venezuelan government. However, not all executives were reassured.Darren Woods, chief executive of ExxonMobil, described the current situation in stark terms. “If we look at the commercial constructs and frameworks in place today in Venezuela, today it’s uninvestable,” he said.On the same day, Trump also signed an executive order aimed at protecting Venezuelan oil revenues from being used in judicial proceedings. The order, released publicly on Saturday, warned that allowing such funds to be seized could “undermine critical US efforts to ensure economic and political stability in Venezuela.”The country has long faced state asset seizures, US sanctions and prolonged political uncertainty.Securing investment from US oil companies to help rebuild Venezuela’s infrastructure has become a key objective of the Trump administration following Maduro’s capture.The White House has presented the approach as an economic strategy, with Trump already having seized tankers transporting Venezuelan oil, announced that the US is taking control of the sale of 30 million to 50 million barrels of previously sanctioned crude, and stated plans to oversee those sales globally on an indefinite basis.",Trump criticises ExxonMobil after its leadership questioned the viability of investing in the country.

"Federal Reserve Chair Powell says DOJ has subpoenaed central bank, threatens criminal indictment",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/federal-reserve-chair-powell-says-doj-has-subpoenaed-central-bank-threatens-criminal-indictment/articleshow/126474005.cms,"US DOJ ‘Backtracks’ On Full Epstein Files Release; ‘Over 2 Million Docs To Take 8 Years…’

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Sunday the Department of Justice has served the central bank with subpoenas and threatened it with a criminal indictment over his testimony this summer about the Fed's building renovations.The move represents an unprecedented escalation in President Donald Trump's battle with the Fed, an independent agency he has repeatedly attacked for not cutting its key interest rate as quickly as Trump prefers. The subpoena relates to his testimony before the Senate Banking Committee in June, Powell said, regarding the Fed's $2.5 billion renovation of two office buildings, a project that Trump criticized as excessive.Powell on Sunday cast off what has up to this point been a restrained approach to Trump's criticisms and personal insults, which he has mostly ignored. Instead, Powell issued a video statement in which he bluntly characterized the threat of criminal charges as simple ""pretexts"" to undermine the Fed's independence when it comes to setting interest rates.""This is about whether the Fed will be able to continue to set interest rates based on evidence and economic conditions - or whether instead monetary policy will be directed by political pressure or intimidation,"" Powell said.It's a sharp departure from the Fed's understated response to Trump this year. The central bank has attempted to placate the administration by dialing back some policies, such as efforts to consider the impact of climate change on the banking system, that the administration clearly opposed.In a brief interview with NBC News Sunday, Trump insisted he didn't know about the investigation into Powell. When asked if the investigation is intended to pressure Powell on rates, Trump said, ""No. I wouldn't even think of doing it that way.""Powell's term as chair ends in May, and Trump administration officials have signaled that he could name a potential replacement this month. Trump has also sought to fire Fed governor Lisa Cook, an unprecedented step, though she has sued to keep her job and courts have ruled she can remain in her seat while the case plays out. The Supreme Court will hear arguments in that case Jan. 21.At the Senate Banking Committee hearing in June, Chairman Tim Scott, a Republican from South Carolina, said the Fed's building renovation included ""rooftop terraces, custom elevators that open into VIP dining rooms, white marble finishes, and even a private art collection.""Powell disputed those details in his testimony, saying ""there's no new marble. ... there are no special elevators"" and added that some items are ""not in the current plan."" In July, Russell Vought, director of the Office of Management and Budget, said in a letter to Powell that his testimony ""raises serious questions about the project's compliance"" with previous plans approved by a planning commission.Still, later that month, Trump visted the building site and, while standing next to Powell, overstated the cost of the renovation. Later that day, Trump, speaking to reporters, downplayed any concerns with the renovation. He said, ""they have to get it done"" and added, ""Look, there's always Monday morning quarterbacks. I don't want to be that. I want to help them get it finished.""When asked if it was a firing offense, Trump said, ""I don't want to put that in this category.""The Justice Department in a statement Sunday said it can't comment on any particular case, but added that Attorney General Pam Bondi ""has instructed her US Attorneys to prioritize investigating any abuse of tax payer dollars.""Timothy Lauer, a spokesperson for U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro's office, said they don't comment on ongoing investigations.With the subpoenas, Powell becomes the latest perceived adversary of the president to face a criminal investigation by the Trump administration's Justice Department. Trump himself has urged prosecutions of his political opponents, obliterating institutional guardrails for a Justice Department that for generations has taken care to make investigative and prosecutorial decisions independent of the White House.The potential indictment has already drawn concern from one Republican senator, who said he'll oppose any future nominee to the central bank, including any replacement for Powell, until ""this legal matter is fully resolved.""""If there were any remaining doubt whether advisers within the Trump Administration are actively pushing to end the independence of the Federal Reserve, there should now be none,"" said North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis, who sits on the Banking Committee, which oversees Fed nominations.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Startups will play important role in helping India become 3rd largest economy: CEA Nageswaran,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/startups-will-play-important-role-in-helping-india-become-3rd-largest-economy-cea-nageswaran/articleshow/105332523.cms,"Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran





THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor (CEA) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran Udaan until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.Udaan built an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business still accounts for a very small part of India’s overall retail market but can balloon to $150 billion in sales and yield a 100% return on capital invested in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co. estimates published in the Mint newspaper.Bengaluru-based Udaan has also ventured into financing through its fintech unit which helps shopkeepers get working capital loans to buy inventory. That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says.

How India's GDP has been growing

What SBI report said on savings and investment

Incremental capital output ratio

NEW DELHI: India's gross domestic product (GDP) data for the third quarter (October-December 2022) received a word of caution from the former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan In an interview with news agency PTI, Rajan that India is ""dangerously close"" to the Hindu rate of growth in view of subdued private sector investment, high interest rates and slowing global growth.India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying"".However, a report released by the State Bank of India (SBI) economists on Tuesday dismissed arguments that India is dangerously close to Hindu rate of growth saying such statements are ""ill-conceived, biased and premature"".The term 'Hindu growth rate' was coined by late economist Raj Krishna in 1978 to describe the slow growth in the country.It basically refers to the low pace of economic growth rates during 1950s to 1980s. During this period, the Indian economy averaged 3.5%.A former lecturer at the Delhi School of Economics (DSE), Krishna noted that only if the rate of growth is persistently slow and accompanied by low per-capita GDP, then it will be known as Hindu rate of growth but it has to factor in population growth as well.Before economic reforms of 1991, India's economic growth remained stagnant and low, while per capita income averaged around 1.3%.Krishna termed this low growth situation to be a result of socialist policies of state control and import substitution.However, the economic situation changed when liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation (LPG) reforms came into effect in the year 1991, at a time when India faced balance of payment crisis.Over the years, many economists have strongly opposed the idea of 'Hindu growth rate' and the term never had universal acceptance.The Indian economy plunged into its very first technical recession in FY21 due to the impact of Covid-19 pandemic and the related nationwide lockdowns. GDP shrunk by an unprecedented 23.8% in the first quarter of the financial year 2020-21. However, due to spurt in economic activities in the subsequent quarters, the GDP decline started to narrow.However, if we look at the period before Covid-19 as well, India's growth curve shows a declining trend.From 8.26% in FY17, GDP growth plunged to 3.74% in FY20. Shutdown of economic activities in FY21 in wake of Covid-19 only made matters worse.As lockdowns started to ease and business activities resumed, India's GDP also started rising. In Q1 of FY22, growth jumped to 20.1% mainly on account of low base effect. By the fourth quarter of FY22, growth came down to 4.10%.Similarly, the new financial year 2022-23 brought fresh economic challenges in the form of Russia-Ukraine war that impacted almost all major economies of the world, slowed the pace of growth, pushed inflation to record highs.As a result, the central banks of all advanced economies spurred into action and opted for monetary policy tightening to curb the soaring inflation.With persistently rising interest rates, India's economy grew by 4.4% in Q3 of FY23, as the Centre revised upwards GDP growth for previous year to 9.10% from 8.7% earlier.The report weighed recent GDP numbers against the available data on savings and investments for the past decade and highlighted some interesting points.""Quarterly growth numbers are noisy and should be best avoided for any serious interpretation (on an average, India's GDP growth has witnessed Rs 2 lakh crore upward revision for the 3 year ended FY23),"" the report said.Gross capital formation (GCF) by the government touched a high of 11.8% in 2021-22, up from 10.7% in 2020-21.""This also had a domino effect on private sector investment that jumped from 10 per cent to 10.8% over the same period,"" it said.In fact, Ecowrap added that the trends in GCF to gross output ratio or the plough back of funds for creation of fresh capacity shows that for public administration the ratio attained fresh peak in 2021-22 owing to the emphasis on capital expenditure in recent budgets.At the aggregate level, gross capital formation is supposed to have crossed 32% in 2022-23, the highest level since 2018-19.According to the report, in 2021-22, gross savings have risen to 30% from 29% in 2020-21.""The ratio is supposed to have crossed 31 per cent in 2022-23, the highest since 2018-19. The household savings increased sharply during the pandemic period on account of sharp accretion in financial savings such as deposits,"" said the report by SBI's Economic Research Department.While household financial savings have since then moderated from 15.4% in 2020-21 to 11.1% in 2022-23, savings in physical assets have grown sharply to 11.8% in 2021-22 from 10.7% in 2020-21.The report further analysed Incremental Capital Output ratio (ICOR) -- which measures additional units of capital (investment) needed to produce additional units of output. It said that the ratio has been improving.""ICOR which was 7.5 in FY 12 is now only 3.5 in FY22. Clearly, only half of capital is now needed for next unit of output,"" the report noted.Such reducing ICOR in the current years reflects a relatively increasing efficiency of capital and shows that the economy is on a sound footing, the report said.""From that point of view, future GDP growth rates even at 7% could still mean a decent number by any standards!,"" it added.","India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.

An employee is entitled for a 50 per cent amount of the last drawn salary as pension.OPS was discontinued by the NDA government in 2003 with effect from April 1, 2004.Under the new pension scheme (NPS), employees contribute 10 per cent of their basic salary towards pension while the government contributes 14 per cent.Governments of Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand have informed the central government/ Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA about their decision to restart OPS for their employees.The government of Punjab on November 18, 2022, issued a notification regarding implementation of OPS for the state government employees who are being covered under NPS. Jharkhand too has decided to revert to OPS.",Former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan has expressed his concern over the decision of some states to restart the old pension scheme.

All the state governments were asked to open procurement centres for coarse grains in producing districts, especially, in tribal areas. State governments were asked to encourage consumption of coarse grains as well.The conference also deliberated on fighting anaemia and nutritional deficiencies in various parts of the country by suitably creating awareness on benefits of fortified rice.The issues related to smart Public Distribution System (PDS) and One Nation One Ration Card scheme for seamless delivery of foodgrains to migrant beneficiaries were also discussed.FCI (Food Corporation of India) is the government's nodal agency that undertakes procurement and distribution of foodgrains for the PDS and welfare schemes.The best practice of command control centre by Andhra Pradesh for real time data on procurement, storage, quality and distribution of foodgrains was also discussed, for which all states have been urged to learn and adopt the methods to make their systems effective and efficient.Further, implementation of additional minimum threshold parameters for online procurement operations, i.e. integration of power validation of milled rice quantity with electricity consumption and tracking of vehicles used for transporting food grains were also deliberated upon for improving efficiency and transparency in procurement operations.During the discussion, it emerged that sufficient jute bags are available as per requirement of ensuing season.

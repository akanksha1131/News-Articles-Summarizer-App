New labour codes: From layoff guidelines to timely wages; new checklist issued for employers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/new-labour-codes-from-layoff-guidelines-to-timely-wages-new-checklist-issued-for-employers/articleshow/128589758.cms,"Labour and employement ministry has detailed a compliance checklist for employers in order to tighten accountability and minimise legal disputes. The ministry has listed almost two dozen requirements under the four labour codes: the Code on Wages, the Code on Social Security, the Industrial Relations Code and the Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions Code.A senior government official told ET that although most of the requirements existed under the earlier labour framework, the newly prepared handbook is meant to remove ambiguity and clearly spell out employer responsibilities during the transition. ""It will act as a to-do list for establishments to ensure that no evasion on compliances happens for lack of clarity due to transition from the old labour laws to the new labour codes,"" the official said on condition of anonymity.The four labour codes came into force on November 21, 2025, replacing 29 central labour laws with a unified structure.Under the new system, employers must complete seven foundational compliances from the time a business is set up or a new worker joins. Beyond this, establishments are also required to meet four monthly and five annual compliance obligations. The framework further specifies six event-related compliances that become applicable in situations such as workplace accidents, disease outbreaks, employee exits, maternity benefit cases, large-scale layoffs, and lockouts or strikes within factory premises.Officials indicated that the ministry is in the final phase of finalising central rules under the four codes. The government’s intent is to ensure employers begin complying with statutory requirements early, thereby reducing the scope for litigation later.Among the basic obligations are registering the establishment and securing required licences, maintaining key records on attendance, wages, deductions and overtime, fixing wage periods, ensuring minimum workplace safety standards, enrolling eligible workers for social security, and forming work committees along with grievance redressal bodies.Every month, employers must ensure timely wage payments, deposit social security contributions with the Employees' Provident Fund Organisation and the Employees' State Insurance Corporation, and provide wage slips to workers.On an annual basis, establishments are required to file a unified return, revise minimum wages where applicable, renew licences, carry out safety audits, and conduct annual health check-ups for specified employees aged 40 years and above.In event-based scenarios, employers must report workplace accidents or disease occurrences within 24 to 72 hours, clear final dues within two days and gratuity within 30 days, obtain government approval for layoffs, retrenchment or closure in units employing more than 300 workers, extend maternity benefits where applicable, and issue lockout notices to workers and the relevant authority.","The four labour codes came into force on November 21, 2025, replacing 29 central labour laws with a unified structure.

US Set To Induct India Into Pax Silica In Feb As Global Tech Alliances Shift Beyond Old Power Blocs

What is Pax Silica?

NEW DELHI: India is likely to formally join the US-led Pax Silica strategic alliance on Friday, amid efforts by New Delhi and Washington to finalise a proposed trade deal and advance other initiatives to strengthen ties.Pax Silica is an initiative aimed at building a secure, resilient and innovation-driven supply chain for critical minerals and artificial intelligence (AI).India’s expected entry in February 2026 would bring its large talent pool, semiconductor ambitions and strategic location into the alliance, giving New Delhi a seat in shaping the future economic and technology architecture.US Ambassador to India Sergio Gor last month announced an invitation to New Delhi to join the alliance.""We recognise that a reliable supply chain is indispensable to our mutual economic security,"" according to the Pax Silica declaration.""We also recognize that artificial intelligence represents a transformative force for our long-term prosperity and that trustworthy systems are essential to safeguarding our mutual security and prosperity,"" it said.""We believe that economic value and growth will flow through and across all levels of the global AI supply chain, driving historic opportunity and demand for energy, critical minerals, manufacturing, technological hardware, infrastructure, and new markets not yet invented,"" it said.Pax Silica, launched in December 2025 to secure the global AI and semiconductor supply chain and reduce dependence on non-aligned nations, includes the United States, Japan, South Korea and other trusted partners.Member nations currently include Australia, Greece, Israel, Japan, Qatar, the Republic of Korea, Singapore, the United Arab Emirates and the United Kingdom.The initiative aims to build a secure, resilient and innovation-driven supply chain for critical minerals and artificial intelligence (AI). A Pax Silica Summit was held in Washington on December 12, where partner nations signed the Pax Silica declaration outlining a shared vision of deep economic and technology cooperation across supply chains — from raw materials through semiconductors and AI infrastructure — and a commitment to mutual prosperity and security.One of the key pillars of Pax Silica is establishing a durable economic order to drive AI-powered prosperity across partner nations.","Pax Silica is an initiative aimed at building a secure, resilient and innovation-driven supply chain for critical minerals and artificial intelligence.

On the weekly chart, MCX Gold has been moving in a consolidation phase after retreating from its recent high. The price action appears to be building a base near an upward-sloping trend line on the weekly time frame, and a decisive close below this support could trigger further correction in the precious metal. Nevertheless, the broader trend remains bullish as long as prices hold above the recent swing lows.For the coming week, the 147,000 level is expected to act as a crucial support zone, as it coincides with the rising trend line and strengthens its technical importance. Any pullback toward this area may invite fresh buying interest, helping to cushion immediate downside risks. As long as prices remain above this threshold, the broader bullish structure stays intact, reinforcing the prevailing upward momentum.Gold seems poised to extend its rally toward the 163,000 mark in the upcoming sessions. This anticipated move is likely to represent a rebound from support, paving the way for sustained bullish momentum in the near term.Moreover, the steady price action within the weekly consolidation range supports the positive outlook and points to the possibility of a continued recovery.In conclusion, gold maintains a sideways-to-positive bias, with the technical structure supporting the potential for further gains. As long as prices hold decisively above the key 147,000 support level, the broader bullish setup remains intact. Backed by supportive momentum indicators and a positive sentiment backdrop, the precious metal appears well-positioned to trade within its established range, with an upward inclination in the sessions ahead.On the weekly chart, Silver has sustained its support for the third straight week. After rebounding from recent lows, prices are now hovering near a crucial support zone, suggesting a possible continuation of the sideways-to-positive bias in the coming week. With the broader trend still positive, short-term pullbacks may offer buying opportunities, as long as the previous week’s low remains intact. Traders are encouraged to trade in line with the prevailing trend while maintaining stop-loss levels near the recent weekly lows to manage risk prudently.The week commenced on a weaker note, with prices drifting toward the weekly low support, reinforcing the prevailing sideways momentum. However, a rebound from these support levels is anticipated to revive the broader bullish trend. The positive outlook remains valid as long as prices continue to trade above the established weekly support zones. Immediate support is seen near the 225,000 mark, and a decisive close below this threshold may soften the bullish bias. Until such a breakdown materializes, corrective declines are expected to attract fresh buying interest, thereby maintaining the overall upward trajectory.On the upside, silver appears well-positioned to test the 30-day EMA near the 260,000 resistance level in the near to medium term. A sustained move toward this barrier would reaffirm the continuation of the prevailing bullish cycle, backed by firm momentum and supportive technical indicators. Overall, provided prices remain firmly above the 225,000 support zone, the upward trend is expected to stay intact, paving the way for additional gains amid improving positive sentiment.","Gold may extend its rally to the Rs 1,63,000 per 10 grams mark and silver has managed to sustain support, says Abhilash Koikkara, Head - Forex & Commodities, Nuvama Professional Clients Group.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128546522,imgsize-62694,width-400,resizemode-4/gold-price-prediction-ai-image.jpg"
"Income Tax notice alert! Senior executives with over Rs 50 lakh salaries under radar for ‘underreporting income’, misusing exemptions",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/income-tax-notice-alert-senior-executives-with-over-rs-50-lakh-salaries-under-radar-for-underreporting-income-misusing-exemptions/articleshow/128541666.cms,"The Income Tax Department has flagged cases involving non-disclosure of overseas assets and foreign income. (AI image)

Why Income Tax Notices Are Being Sent

Tax notices

Income Tax Notice alert! The Income Tax Department is cracking down on alleged misreporting of income by senior executives across multinational companies and startups. Several such executives earning over Rs 50 lakh have received tax notices from the I-T Department.The tax department has alleged that in all these cases the income has either been underreported, misreported, or false exemptions have been claimed to reduce tax outgo.The Income Tax Department has flagged cases involving non-disclosure of overseas assets and foreign income, understatement of stock-based compensation, and inflated claims of benefits such as accommodation and travel allowances aimed at lowering taxable income.According to officials quoted in an ET report, the Income Tax Department authorities have issued notices to these individuals — including chief executives and managing directors at multinational corporations — asking them to correct discrepancies in their filings before any action is taken.Executives from industries including, information technology, fast-moving consumer goods, hospitality, engineering and construction, and automobiles have received such notices.Officials cited in the report said that several founders and senior leaders from startups have also attracted the tax department’s scrutiny.In many instances, the taxpayers are alleged to have sought tax relief by reporting bogus donations to religious bodies, charitable organisations, or educational institutions.We are examining more than two dozen cases involving investments in high-value properties, over 50 instances where substantial secondary income was received from foreign clients in cryptocurrencies, and cases featuring significant contributions to political parties that are neither officially recognised nor participating in elections, a senior official was quoted as saying.These irregularities came to light following closer scrutiny of income tax returns filed by high earners during the ongoing assessment period. Under its ‘Non-intrusive Usage of Data to Guide and Enable (Nudge)’ initiative, the department has prompted several executives to submit revised returns to address inconsistencies.An official noted that some taxpayers assumed overseas acquisitions and holdings would escape detection. However, with the government getting important financial information through automated data-sharing arrangements and monitoring linked to the Permanent Account Number (PAN), concealing such foreign dealings has become far more challenging.Among the undeclared assets that have been identified are properties registered in the names of spouses and minor children, foreign equity investments, cryptocurrency-based income, and funds maintained in overseas bank accounts.The review also revealed a striking trend: many taxpayers represented by the same chartered accountants were contributing to identical institutions. The official added that separate proceedings are being initiated against those chartered accountants.This enforcement drive is part of the government’s wider effort to strengthen compliance through data-centric oversight. In recent years, authorities have increasingly relied on artificial intelligence-powered analytics to detect mismatches between reported income, tax deducted at source records, and information obtained from third-party financial sources.So far in the current financial year, over 2.1 million taxpayers have revised their returns for assessment years 2021-22 through 2024-25, resulting in additional tax payments exceeding Rs 2,500 crore. Additionally, more than 1.5 million returns have already been updated for the ongoing assessment year.In the 2026-27 Budget, the Centre introduced a one-time six-month compliance window allowing individuals to disclose foreign assets. The measure is intended to offer relief to taxpayers, including professionals with unreported employee stock option holdings and students who continued to hold funds in overseas accounts.","Executives from industries including, information technology, fast-moving consumer goods, hospitality, engineering and construction, and automobiles have received such notices.

Stock market today: Equity benchmarks opened flat on Friday after a crash on Thursday due to escalating geopolitical tensions. While Nifty50 was above 25,450, BSE Sensex was near 82,500. At 9:17 AM, Nifty50 was trading at 25,471.70, up 17 points or 0.068%. BSE Sensex was trading at 82,505.86, up 8 points or 0.0094%.Yesterday, the stock market crashed in trade bringing an end to its three-session rally. Market experts believe investors are likely to adopt a cautious stance in the short term amid rising geopolitical tensions and concerns over potential disruptions to global oil supplies.Any intensification of the situation involving Iran may hinder cargo movement through the Strait of Hormuz, a crucial shipping route. Such a development would pose significant challenges for India, which relies heavily on crude oil imports from that region.Dr. VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Investments Limited says, “The sharp spike in Brent crude to $72 reflects growing fear and uncertainty in markets. President Trump’s warning that “Iran has 10 to 15 days to strike a deal or bad things happen “ has put the markets on tender hooks.Whether there will be a deal after the standoff, or whether missiles will fly will determine the market behaviour in the near-term. The continuing weakness in IT stocks is another dampener for the market.Amidst the many crises, the strength of the Indian economy and the recovery in corporate earnings as reflected in Q3 numbers, are positives for the market. If, hopefully, the US-Iran standoff gets resolved in the coming days, the market will bounce back. Therefore, investors may wait and watch the unfolding developments in West Asia. Meanwhile, investors who are optimistic about a possible deal can use the current weakness in the market to buy fairly valued high quality stocks in banking and financials, autos, pharmaceuticals, hotels, leading capital goods and telecom. Crisis have proved to be buying opportunities, in hindsight.""In the United States, major stock indices closed in the red on Thursday. Declines in private equity firms, along with weakness in Walmart and Apple, weighed on the market, although gains in industrial stocks following earnings announcements helped contain the overall drop.Meanwhile, Asian markets also moved lower as growing tensions surrounding Iran dampened investor confidence, while oil prices climbed to their highest level since August.","Nifty50 was above 25,450, BSE Sensex was near 82,500.

The index formed a sizable bearish candle on the daily chart and slipped below the lower boundary of the 25,500–26,000 consolidation range, indicating a decisive loss of short-term momentum. The sharp decline has brought Nifty close to its previous swing low, thereby shifting the near-term bias to cautious and signalling the need for stability at lower levels.Technically, the index has broken below both the 50Day EMA and the 21day EMA in a single move, reflecting strong selling pressure.The 200-day EMA, placed near 25,200, is now the next crucial short term support zone and appears vulnerable if follow-up selling persists in the coming sessions.On the downside, immediate supports are seen at 25,350 and 25,000, which may act as key cushions in case of further weakness.On the upside, resistance is placed at 25,650, followed by 25,720, where any pullback is likely to face selling pressure.The index surrendered most of the gains from the previous two sessions and formed a large bearish engulfing candle on the daily chart, indicating strong profit booking near all-time high levels.It witnessed sharp selling from the highs and eventually closed near the day’s low, reflecting sustained weakness throughout the session.The 21-day EMA, placed around 60,300, emerges as the key level to watch, as the index has found support near this average on multiple prior occasions. Immediate support is seen at 60,300, followed by 60,000.On the upside, near-term resistance is positioned at 61,500 and 61,750. In the near term, the index is likely to trade within a broad range of 60,000–61,500, and a decisive breakout on either side could trigger fresh directional momentum.On the weekly chart, IndusInd Bank shows a steady recovery after a prolonged downtrend, with price holding above the 21 EMA, indicating improving momentum.The stock appears to be forming a rounding base and is now consolidating near the 900–950 zone after a gradual up move.The rising 21 EMA is acting as immediate support, while RSI near the 50–60 range reflects neutral-to-positive strength.Immediate resistance is placed at 950–980 followed by 1060 which is 200 weeks EMA. On the downside, supports are seen at 880–860.UPL has displayed strong bullish momentum on the daily chart, forming a positive candle while sustaining a clear pattern of higher highs and higher lows, indicating a strengthening upward trend. The stock has also delivered a swing breakout supported by a noticeable rise in trading volumes, reflecting improving buying participation and reinforcing the positive price structure. Also It has started to move above its 21 weeks EMA indicating short term positive bias.Technically, the breakout offers a favorable risk–reward opportunity on the long side. As long as the stock sustains above key support levels, momentum is likely to remain intact. Going ahead, the stock is expected to move towards the ₹830 mark, which coincides with its previous all-time high and acts as the next major resistance zone. A strict stop loss should be maintained near ₹728 to manage downside risk.","Bajaj Broking Research shares its view on Nifty and Bank Nifty.

New Delhi: Chennai-based startup The ePlane Company is building India's first electric air taxi, the e200x, using advanced technology from Nvidia. Engineers have created a highly detailed ""digital twin"" of the aircraft using Nvidia Omniverse software, allowing them to test flight physics, sensors and emergency scenarios in a virtual world before the real aircraft takes off.The company will also use Nvidia's computing platform onboard the aircraft to process data from cameras and radars, helping the air taxi make safe, real-time decisions. By flying millions of virtual kilometres first, ePlane aims to make urban air travel safer and more reliable.The collaboration also opens a new frontier for India's aviation sector. The computational intensity of these simulations requires high-performance computing (HPC) infrastructure, leveraging advanced GPUs to render physics in real time. This digital twin can also function as a predictive analytics engine, mirroring the configuration of actual aircraft components to anticipate maintenance needs well before a failure occurs.""This isn't just a simulation; it's a time machine for safety. Our aircraft live a thousand lives in the digital testbed, where algorithms can master the unknown, test the most remote scenarios, and improve exponentially.

CLSA has downgraded Dixon Technologies to hold from outperform with the target price cut to Rs 12,100 from Rs 15,800 earlier. Analysts said the memory industry is entering a super cycle, driven by AI’s appetite for high-bandwidth memory (HBM) and DDR5, while mainstream storage faces tightening supply and rising costs. India’s dependence on imports leaves it exposed to this global squeeze, especially as memory manufacturers prioritise high-margin AI-grade memory. As a result, memory prices have already surged. They believe smartphone volumes are at risk, as rising memory costs could inflate average selling prices by 10-25%, disproportionately impacting the lower-end consumer segment. Analysts downgraded the stock given risks to low-end smartphone volumes and concerns around medium-term growth visibility.Jefferies has a buy on Alkem Labs with the target price at Rs 6,550. Analysts said the management recently discussed their Medtech strategy and recent Occlutech acquisition. Taking the inorganic route, Alkem has built divisions over two years and has focused on ortho and now cardiac segments. The company now plans to consolidate these acquisitions and scale up its business organically. Though nascent at present, over the next five years the management envisions Medtech sales of Rs 1,000 crore and 20-25% earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) margins.Motilal Oswal Securities has a buy on Tata Steel with the target price at Rs 240. Analysts said they remain constructive on the back of a strong domestic demand outlook, safeguard duty-led price support, ongoing capacity expansions and a gradual turnaround in its EU business. They expect capacity expansion to drive Tata Steel’s earnings amid demand upswing. They also expect steel prices to recover, backed by safeguard duty, Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CABM) and China’s supply discipline. Analysts are also expecting breakeven for European operations.Citigroup has a buy on LIC Housing with the target price at Rs 730. Analysts feel that the company’s stock is the least expensive and the company is conspicuously overlooked as a housing finance company following pronounced underperformance across 3/6/12 months. Its current price embeds conservative 11.5% return on equity (RoE)/4% loan growth medium-to-long-term assumptions, creating a compelling entry valuation for patient capital. The management is actively recalibrating strategy, enhancing distribution, elevating agent productivity, scaling direct/lead generation, exploring co-lending, and expanding capacity in the self-employed and affordable segments. Analysts feel risk-reward looks compelling for the stock with limited downside.Goldman Sachs has a buy on Eicher Motors with the target price raised to Rs 9,200 from Rs 8,600 earlier. Analysts feel post the GST cuts in Sept 2025 on sub 350cc motorcycles, Eicher's Hunter 350cc has steadily re-rated to a 20k per month volume run rate in the domestic market (vs 15k per month 12 months ago). They also expect part of the announced capacity acceleration over next 24 months to support more volume growth on Hunter 350cc (especially heading into a pay commission phase in FY28 and beyond).

New Delhi: Imagine a world where your home unlocks as you approach, adjusts the temperature before you feel the chill, quietly monitors your health, and safeguards your property without a single visible barrier. Your car becomes a rolling living room, steering, braking, and navigating hazards long before they enter your line of sight. In factories, humans no longer wrestle with machines but supervise fleets of intelligent systems. This, said Lars Reger, global chief technology officer at NXP Semiconductors, is the next phase of technological evolution: ""A world that anticipates and automates.""Over the next decade, Reger predicts that tens of billions of smart, connected robots will be embedded in homes, cars, hospitals and infrastructure. However different their form factors, they will share four essential capabilities: Sensing, thinking, connecting, and acting. Devices will perceive their environment, draw on cloud intelligence, make decisions, and execute them physically. Yet none of this matters, he warned, if users cannot trust the device. Trust means functional safety and cybersecurity - braking systems that never fail, thermostats that do not overheat homes, and cars that cannot be hacked.Autonomous systems have faltered before because, in his view, they were designed incorrectly. The solution, he argued, is to take inspiration from biology. The human body separates fast, deterministic reflexes from higher cognition, Not every decision requires a vast AI brain. ""How big does the AI really have to be?"" he asked, noting that an ant's 100,000 neurons can create an efficient transportation system.The future, according to Reger, lies at the edge: Ultra-low-power chips, AI accelerators consuming as little as seven watts, radar that can see through fog and car-to-car communication that functions almost like telepathy. Data centres will remain important, but the real democratisation of AI, he insisted, ""lies at the famous edge in the end device"" - in billions of quiet, trusted machines that anticipate our needs before we voice them.","Over the next decade, tens of billions of smart, connected robots will be embedded in homes, cars, hospitals and infrastructure. Devices will perceive their environment, draw on cloud intelligence, make decisions, and execute them physically.

Companies see AI as a growth engine: Accenture CEO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/companies-see-ai-as-a-growth-engine-accenture-ceo/articleshow/128584224.cms,"Accenture CEO Julie Sweet highlights need for AI access for SMEs to drive inclusive global growth

Companies building AI tech are making big investments. How is business adoption of AI?

Equity investors seem wary of the impact of AI tools on IT services. How do you see this?

As AI becomes more autonomous, who is accountable - the board, the CEO, or the developer?

Accenture is stopping AI-specific revenue disclosures. How should investors track progress?

Close to half of your 7.8 lakh employees are in India. Give us a sense of the role your India employees are playing.

What is your advice for youngsters and universities, given how AI is changing job roles?

New Delhi: Julie Sweet is CEO of Accenture, the world's largest IT consulting and services company, with revenue of $70 billion. After a 10-year legal career, Sweet joined Accenture as general counsel in 2010 and was appointed CEO in 2019. In her first interaction with the media in India, where Accenture employs 3.5 lakh people, Sweet spoke about AI's transformational capabilities, how LLMs are becoming the new malls, and AI's impact on talent.Demand is significant and shifting. Our latest quarterly survey of C-suites across 20 countries found that the biggest value for AI is driving growth. This is a shift from the discussion about productivity and efficiency. For clients, it is the old maxim: You cannot cut your way to growth, and the bigger opportunity is to drive growth. For example, LLMs are going to become a new mall. This is an entirely new channel and very different from what it was in search of. All the main model providers and big tech ecosystems are creating the technology now (to buy on LLMs). To show up in these models and engage a customer, businesses must have different kinds of content and enable the ability to buy.That is like making the impossible possible. Small and medium-sized businesses around the world now suddenly have a marketplace they did not have before. AI's productivity improvements are great, but more importantly, that is giving companies more capacity to invest in AI for growth and create new products.AI is very early in terms of technology. So, there is a fair amount of uncertainty about how AI develops and what the impacts are. The only certainty is that companies need to adopt it and they need help. There are all these debates around models, chips, and energy. What no one is debating is that adoption is the biggest barrier, and that is where Accenture can help, with its industry expertise, functional expertise, and ability to execute at scale. We did the biggest reinventions over the last several years; we have the largest AI workforce and experience of any of our peers in terms of actual execution. So, we are focused on this big opportunity.Humans remain in the lead. Governance does not change because technology evolves. Companies have boards and CEOs who are responsible for everything that happens. Leaders manage far more technology today than a decade ago, yet accountability has not shifted. But responsibility ultimately rests with the board and CEO.When ChatGPT surged, there was uncertainty about its business impact. In 2023, we reported $100 million in advanced AI sales to demonstrate leadership and transparency-rapid growth, but from a small base. None of our peers broke out pure advanced AI revenues the way we did. At the time, most of the work was proof-of-concept, so it was easy to isolate. We reported only advanced AI, not the classical AI we delivered for years. Now it is integrated into large transformations, making separation less meaningful. That reflects market maturity. Ultimately, investors judge us on top-line growth and bottom-line results. AI's value lies in driving enterprise-wide impact, not sitting in a silo.In India, we will hire more people this year than last. At the same time, how we onboard and train talent is changing dramatically. Graduates today arrive far more AI-native than those who entered the workforce 5 years ago. Entry-level employees are critical because they bring new ways of working and thinking. Everyone at Accenture is being trained in agentic AI, and India has one of the largest AI workforces in the world, tightly integrated with our hubs in the US, Europe, and Japan. India is not just a delivery centre - it is central to our AI capability build-out.You have to walk in with AI fluency. That was not true 3 years ago. So, it is absolutely critical that universities work with the private sector to truly understand the skills employers need now and make sure that their youth have those skills.","Julie Sweet is CEO of Accenture, the world's largest IT consulting and services company, with revenue of $70 billion.

'Secure chatbots or your wife may know your secrets',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/secure-chatbots-or-your-wife-may-know-your-secrets/articleshow/128584122.cms,"Trust, governance, security are key challenges in AI era: Nikesh Arora, CEO, Palo Alto Networks

New Delhi: What if your spouse discovers your deepest secrets by scrolling through your chatbot conversations? Nikesh Arora, CEO of cybersecurity giant Palo Alto Networks, says companies like his are racing to address emerging risks in an increasingly AI-reliant world.""My fear is that in about six months, if I'm talking to my AI model, it might know more things about me than I've told my wife,"" he told the audience at the India AI Impact Summit in New Delhi on Thursday. ""I don't want my wife to get her hands on my Gemini prompts because I'm surprised what it might tell her.""The remark drew laughs but underscored a serious concern: AI systems are fast becoming therapists, nutritionists, financial advisers and confidants. Users are sharing intimate details with machines that promise convenience and insight. As Arora noted, if that data ""falls into the wrong hands, it's not a good idea.""The broader danger, he argued, is structural. ""AI is accelerating faster than our institutions, our governance frameworks, and even our intuition,"" he said. At present, ""the balance is tilted... not in the favour of trust, inclusion, security; it's actually tilted in the favour of speed.""AI brings new models and capabilities every week, often released before guardrails are fully formed.As the world moves toward an ""agentic"" future - where AI systems can act autonomously - the risks multiply. ""As soon as you give control to an agent, you have to worry about who's responsible for the actions of those agents,"" he said. If an AI mismanages your investments or transfers money without consent, accountability becomes blurred. The same applies to physical systems: How do you ensure that a robot designed to assist at home cannot be manipulated?Arora was blunt about the limits of prohibition. ""AI is not going to go away if you govern it out of existence. It cannot be governed out of existence,"" he said. The answer, instead, lies in embedding governance and accountability into the technology itself. For cybersecurity firms, that means building protection from the outset. AI must be ""secure, governed and controlled"" - not patched after damage is done. That includes safeguarding vast datasets, monitoring AI-generated code that could be malicious or flawed, and preparing for adversarial AI systems designed to exploit vulnerabilities.Yet Arora clarified that he remains optimistic - not only that we will navigate this new terrain, but that it will create new opportunities. ""I have a conviction that we're going to need five times the number of technology people in the future than we have today,"" he said, arguing that security, governance and oversight will generate new roles rather than eliminate them.","Palo Alto Networks CEO: Trust, governance, security are key challenges in AI era.

New Delhi: Warning about concentration risk from a few companies dominating AI, Arthur Mensch, co-founder and CEO of Mistral, said India should support open-source models and collaborate with global startup labs and researchers to maintain strategic autonomy and ensure the country benefits from AI-driven productivity and economic growth.Speaking at the India AI Impact Summit on Thursday, he said, ""AI will contribute significant double-digit growth to GDP in the coming years. It is critical that everyone has access to the on and off switch to ensure business continuity and that countries are not dependent on external providers who can effectively shut off access. The global AI landscape is rapidly evolving and is highly focused on control, surveillance and leverage. Countries need a future grounded in openness, trust, and autonomy. It is a fundamental right for countries to own their AI destiny. This is crucial for preserving digital autonomy and shaping our own future.""He also argued that the leverage of larger players must be curbed, noting that India's market size gives it the power to build a different pathway for AI progress.Mensch, a key figure in the French AI startup ecosystem and one of the few competing in large language model development, said open source is not a radical idea, pointing out that it underpinned the internet and cloud computing.As of Sept last year, the French AI startup was valued at nearly $14 billion.""Today we are facing a dichotomy between open source, where a few companies like Mistral compete, and models developed by large private corporations that are using them as leverage.""He called for collaboration to build better open-source AI, especially for low-resource languages, with a special focus on India's 22 official languages. ""Our key goal is to ensure that more languages are properly represented in these models. To do this, Mistral works with local ecosystems and labs that can help acquire and curate high-quality text and speech data in these languages. The idea is that by feeding this diverse content into open-source models, they become more accurate and useful for local populations, not just English-speaking users.

New Delhi: At the India AI Summit, a trio of domestic model launches signalled that India is no longer merely trying to keep pace in the global AI arms race, but to redefine what winning looks like.Rather than chasing ever-larger parameter counts, companies such as BharatGen, Sarvam AI and Gnani.ai are positioning their latest systems as solutions to a problem frontier models have yet to convincingly solve: Linguistic and cultural depth in India.Sarvam AI unveiled a 105-billion-parameter model tuned for Indic reasoning and translation, arguing that global systems often falter when faced with code-mixed text or nuanced local references. The company claims its model can even outperform global tech giants in optical character recognition (OCR) and multilingual speech in Indian languages, citing benchmark scores to back the claim. BharatGen introduced a 17-billion-parameter multilingual Mixture-of-Experts model trained across Indian languages and designed for critical use cases spanning governance, education, healthcare, agriculture and enterprise solutions.Meanwhile, Gnani.ai launched a five-billion-parameter voice-to-voice model built to handle heavy accents, background noise and Hindi-English blends common in everyday Indian speech. The company says it delivers this performance with greater efficiency than larger global models.By contrast, leading systems from OpenAI and Google dominate international benchmarks and parameter counts, but are primarily trained on globally aggregated datasets in which English and Mandarin outweigh most low-resource languages. The result, Indian developers argue, is strong general reasoning paired with uneven contextual fluency on the ground.

Mumbai: Education lending in India is proving unexpectedly resilient. Growth remains brisk and asset quality has improved even as visa curbs for Indian students in some countries and labour-market uncertainty from artificial intelligence cloud employment prospects abroad.Data from Reserve Bank of India show education loans rising 14.8% year-on-year, with banks' outstanding exposure reaching Rs 1.5 lakh crore. Non-performing assets in the segment have fallen sharply, from 7% of loans in FY21 to about 2% in FY25, despite most large loans in this segment being unsecured.Private lenders echo the trend. According to Amit Gainda, MD and CEO of Avanse Financial Services, the company has a loan book of close to Rs 23,000 crore and accounts for nearly 10% of the country's education loan assets, which he expects to grow at 20-25%, driven chiefly by demand for overseas study. Asset quality, he argues, compares favourably with most retail portfolios.""At Avanse Financial Services, our gross stage-3 assets (bad loans) account for just 0.36% of the book; on a net basis, it is 0.06%. Financing penetration of education spend, once below 10%, now approaches 30%.""Part of the reason for this is improved collection mechanisms that enable borrowers abroad to access and service their accounts easily, along with underwriting capabilities lenders have built across educational institutions.""Students are also diversifying their destinations.

Shares of ITC Ltd , Godfrey Phillips India Ltd and VST Industries Ltd climbed by as much as 15%, following media reports that companies have implemented price hikes to pass on the impact of the recent excise duty increase to consumers. As of 1:15 pm, Godfrey Phillips India Ltd was trading at 2,386, up 318 points or 15.4%. At the same time, ITC gained 2% to 331 while VST Industries Ltd strengthened to 244, adding 2%.The move by cigarette makers is seen as a step to protect margins, with the expected decline in EBIT now projected at around 2%, sharply lower than earlier estimates of 8–15%. The changes follow the government’s notification on February 1 ending the GST compensation cess and introducing a new tobacco taxation framework.ITC Ltd is likely to increase cigarette prices by 20–40% across brands. Fresh shipments reflecting the revised pricing are expected to reach the market soon, while retailers are also said to be selling existing inventory at higher rates.Market reaction was swift. ITC Ltd climbed 2% to Rs 331 during the session, extending its gains to a third straight day and taking its cumulative rise over three sessions to about 5.5%.Godfrey Phillips India Ltd jumped 12% to Rs 2,315 per share on the BSE, marking a more than 15% gain over two days. VST Industries Ltd also traded higher, advancing 3.3% in morning deals.The new taxation structure has reset excise duties on cigarettes to between Rs 2,050 and Rs 8,500 per 1,000 sticks, alongside a 40% GST. The revised regime has materially increased the overall tax burden, leading to concerns around demand trends, margins and the possibility of greater illicit trade.The Budget also introduced a technical change to the National Calamity Contingent Duty (NCCD). The statutory NCCD rate on tobacco products has been raised from 25% to 60%, effective May 1, 2026. At the same time, it was clarified that the effective duty rate will continue at 25% through a notification, meaning there is no immediate increase in tax outgo for cigarette companies. In effect, while the duty remains unchanged for now, the government has enabled a future increase without requiring another amendment to the law.In the December quarter, ITC, the country’s largest cigarette manufacturer, reported revenue growth of 6.2% year-on-year. The performance was supported by double-digit expansion in its FMCG-Others business and steady momentum in cigarettes. Cigarette revenues rose 8%, driven by 7% growth in volumes.However, margins in the cigarette segment fell to 59.9%, a multi-quarter low, contracting by 163 basis points year-on-year due to the consumption of high-cost leaf inventory. Management indicated that leaf procurement prices have moderated in the current crop cycle, which could help support margins in the coming quarters.","ITC Ltd is likely to increase cigarette prices by 20–40% across brands.

The gains followed a strong move a day earlier, when oil jumped more than 4%, marking its biggest single-day increase since October.Gold also drew fresh interest from investors. The metal rose 2% on Wednesday, moving back above $5,000 per troy ounce, and added a further 0.2% on Thursday, although trading remained somewhat uneven, CNN reported.The market moves come as US and Iranian representatives met in Geneva in recent days to discuss Iran’s nuclear programme. Speaking on Tuesday, US Vice President JD Vance said Iranian negotiators did not acknowledge some of President Donald Trump’s “red lines” in negotiations.At the same time, the United States has shifted military assets closer to the Middle East. The possibility of escalation involving Iran has unsettled markets, with traders increasingly alert to risks that could affect global oil supplies.“The renewed geopolitical tension between the US and Iran is now clearly feeding into prices,” Daniela Hathorn, senior market analyst at Capital.com, said in a note cited by CNN.Gold’s recent performance has been marked by sharp swings, at times resembling the volatility of a meme stock rather than a typical haven asset. Even so, the latest tensions in the Middle East prompted renewed buying interest, helping the metal regain the $5,000 level.Focus has also returned to the Strait of Hormuz, the narrow passage off Iran’s coast that is vital for global crude flows. According to the US Energy Information Administration, around 20 million barrels of oil pass through the strait each day, roughly one-fifth of global consumption.“The latest move [in oil prices] signals a market strengthening an already notable geopolitical risk premium as the world’s most important oil artery once again sits within striking distance of a conflict,” Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank, said in a note.Iran has recently said it partially closed the Strait of Hormuz for planned naval exercises, according to Iranian media.While financial markets often absorb geopolitical flare-ups without lasting impact, the reaction tends to change when the global oil trade is directly at risk. Investors have historically been less sensitive to developments in countries such as Venezuela, but tensions involving Iran typically draw closer scrutiny because of its location near the crucial shipping route.“In energy markets, probabilities matter, especially when the potential disruption involves a major oil producer and a critical global transit route,” Hathorn at Capital.com said.“Oil markets are starting to price in higher risk as Iran remains a major producer, and more importantly, sits at the heart of the Strait of Hormuz,” she said. “Even limited disruption or credible threats to shipping lanes could cause an immediate supply shock.”The strait is central to Iran’s export flows, meaning any interruption would affect both Tehran’s shipments and major buyers such as China that depend heavily on Iranian oil.Fears of supply disruption have also raised concerns about inflationary pressure globally, as higher crude prices typically feed into consumer costs.“More immediately, strikes on Iran would risk causing oil prices to jump and threaten to boost inflation in much of the world, reducing the pace or number of interest rate cuts by major central banks,” analysts at Capital Economics stated.US equities ended Thursday’s session in the red amid the uncertainty. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 268 points, or 0.54%, the S&P 500 declined 0.28%, and the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.31%.“Given that inflation and affordability are front and center for the White House right now, we’d have to think that protecting the flow of oil through the Strait of Hormuz is a priority, meaning that the priority is a diplomatic solution, and if that is not possible, then a military plan that protects the flow of oil as much as possible,” Dennis Follmer, chief investment officer at Montis Financial, said in a note.A similar pattern was seen in June when tensions between Israel and Iran intensified and the United States conducted strikes on Iranian nuclear sites. Oil prices rose sharply at the time amid fears that Iran might shut the Strait of Hormuz, but those concerns did not materialise and prices later eased as the situation cooled.","Brent crude rose 1.86% to $71.66 a barrel, and US crude climbed 1.9%.

US trade gap widens as goods deficit hits record $1.24 trillion in 2025,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-trade-gap-widens-as-goods-deficit-hits-record-1-24-trillion-in-2025/articleshow/128562261.cms,"India Pushback Forces White House To Rewrite Trade Deal Factsheet Claims On Tariffs, Tax, Purchases

The US trade deficit in goods widened to a record level in 2025 even as overall trade flows expanded, underscoring persistent import strength despite tariffs imposed during President Donald Trump’s first year back in office, according to the US government data.Data released by the Commerce Department showed the US goods deficit reached $1.24 trillion in 2025, slightly wider than the previous year’s level. The figures come despite sweeping tariffs introduced by the administration during the year.Separate data from the US Census Bureau and the Bureau of Economic Analysis showed the overall goods and services trade deficit stood at $70.3 billion in December, rising $17.3 billion from a revised $53.0 billion in November.Exports in December totalled $287.3 billion, down $5.0 billion from the previous month, while imports climbed $12.3 billion to $357.6 billion, driving the widening imbalance. The increase reflected a $15.7 billion jump in the goods deficit to $99.3 billion alongside a narrowing services surplus, which fell $1.6 billion to $29.0 billion.For the full year, however, the combined goods and services deficit edged lower by $2.1 billion to $901.5 billion in 2025.Exports rose strongly by $199.8 billion, or 6.2 per cent, to $3,432.3 billion, while imports increased $197.8 billion, or 4.8 per cent, to $4,333.8 billion.The annual decline in the overall deficit reflected a larger services surplus, which expanded by $27.6 billion to $339.5 billion, partly offsetting a $25.5 billion increase in the goods deficit.Trade flows showed mixed trends across sectors. Goods exports were lifted by gains in capital goods, computers, civilian aircraft and industrial supplies, while imports surged in capital equipment, telecommunications gear and computer accessories. Services exports also strengthened, led by growth in business services, intellectual property charges and financial services.Monthly data indicated shifting trade balances with key partners. In December, the United States recorded trade deficits with Taiwan ($19.8 billion), Vietnam ($17.6 billion), Mexico ($14.5 billion), China ($12.4 billion) and the European Union ($11.1 billion), while posting surpluses with the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and Brazil.Over a three-month average basis, the goods and services deficit widened to $50.7 billion by December, as average imports rose while exports softened modestly.The report noted that all figures were seasonally adjusted and that the next release schedule remains uncertain following a recent lapse in federal funding.","The US goods deficit reached $1.24 trillion in 2025, slightly wider than the previous year’s level.

US stocks moved higher on Wednesday, driven largely by gains in Nvidia, the market’s most influential stock. The S&P 500 rose 0.9%, pulling within 1.1% of its all-time high set late last month. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 308 points, or 0.6%, as of 12:21 p.m. Eastern time, while the Nasdaq composite climbed 1.3%.Nvidia jumped 2.3% after Meta Platforms announced a long-term partnership under which it will use millions of Nvidia chips and related equipment for its artificial intelligence data centers, AP reported.“No one deploys AI at Meta's scale,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said.As the most valuable company on Wall Street, Nvidia’s rise was the single biggest force lifting the S&P 500.The rally highlighted the strong upside that AI development continues to provide for U.S. equities. At the same time, recent sessions have seen sharp swings as investors weigh the potential risks tied to heavy spending on AI.Investors have grown cautious about how much companies such as Meta are investing in artificial intelligence and whether those large outlays will translate into higher profits and productivity.Meta’s stock fell as much as 1.7% earlier in the session before rebounding to post a 0.3% gain.Several corporate earnings reports added to the positive momentum, extending what has been a strong reporting season for major S&P 500 companies.Cadence Design Systems surged 9.1% after reporting quarterly profit and revenue that exceeded analysts’ expectations.Analog Devices rose 2.7% after also topping estimates for profit and revenue.

"" The White House unveiled three large-scale investment projects backed by Tokyo with a combined value of $36 billion, representing the first tranche under Japan’s $550 billion commitment to invest in the United States as part of the newly agreed trade arrangement. Under the trade deal, the US will slash tariffs on Japanese imports to 15%.The initiatives cover energy exports, power generation and advanced manufacturing, spread across Texas, Ohio and Georgia.Announcing the development on Truth Social, President Donald Trump said, ""Our MASSIVE Trade Deal with Japan has just launched! Japan is now officially, and financially, moving forward with the FIRST set of Investments under its $550 BILLION Dollar Commitment to invest in the United States of America — part of our Historic Trade Deal to REVITALIZE the American Industrial Base, create HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS of GREAT American Jobs, and strengthen our National and Economic Security like never before..""He added that the projects would focus on “Oil & Gas in the Great State of Texas, Power Generation in the Great State of Ohio, and Critical Minerals in the Great State of Georgia.”The announcement also includes a $33 billion natural gas-fired power plant in Portsmouth, Ohio. Commerce secretary Howard Lutnick said that the facility would generate 9.2 gigawatts of electricity annually, describing it as the largest natural gas-fired generating facility in US history. According to him, the output would be more than enough to power all homes in Ohio.The plant will be operated by SB Energy, a subsidiary of Japanese technology investor SoftBank Group. The additional capacity is expected to strengthen baseload supply at a time when electricity demand is rising quickly, driven by data centres supporting artificial intelligence applications, Reuters reported.Referring to the Ohio facility in his post, Trump wrote, ""The scale of these projects are so large, and could not be done without one very special word, TARIFFS. The Gas Power Plant in Ohio (A State I won THREE TIMES!) will be the largest in History, the LNG Facility in the Gulf of America will drive Exports, and further our Country's Energy DOMINANCE, and our Critical Minerals Facility will end our FOOLISH dependance on Foreign Sources. ""A second major project involves Japan’s investment in the $2.1 billion Texas GulfLink deepwater crude oil export terminal off the Texas coast. The White House said the funding would support the development of the offshore facility.Lutnick, as cited by Reuters, stated, ""This project is expected to generate $20–30 billion annually in U.S. crude exports, secure export capacity for our refineries, and reinforce America’s position as the world’s leading energy supplier.""Texas GulfLink, being developed by Sentinel Midstream, confirmed its participation in the initiative and said it was ""honored to be a trusted partner with the US department of commerce and the government of Japan.""The third project will see the establishment of a synthetic industrial diamond manufacturing plant in Georgia, valued at around $600 million. Lutnick said the high-pressure facility would meet 100 per cent of US demand for synthetic diamond grit, a material used in advanced manufacturing and semiconductor production. The United States currently relies largely on China for such supplies.The White House said the plant would be operated by Element Six, an industrial diamond company and a unit of De Beers Group, the world’s largest diamond producer.It remains unclear how much of the total project costs will be financed directly by Japanese entities and under what specific conditions. Under an earlier US-Japan agreement, profits from such ventures were to be shared equally until Japan’s initial investment was recovered, after which the split would shift to 90-10 in favour of the United States.The announcements followed meetings last week between Lutnick and Japan’s economic and trade minister, Ryosei Akazawa. Speaking to reporters on Thursday, Akazawa said that several issues were still unresolved before deals could be formally announced.","US President Donald Trump on Tuesday announced a “MASSIVE Trade Deal with Japan,” under which Tokyo will make a ""$550 BILLION commitment to invest in the United States of America"" The initiatives cover energy exports, power generation and advanced manufacturing, spread across Texas, Ohio and Georgia.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128489369,imgsize-1167561,width-400,resizemode-4/ai-generated-image-used-only-for-representational-purpose.jpg"

Discovery rose about 2.8–2.9% after reopening talks with Paramount Skydance on a buyout offer, giving it a week to top a rival bid from Netflix.Paramount Skydance shares climbed 6.9%, while Netflix dipped 0.2%.Losses in some Big Tech stocks weighed on the indexes. Alphabet fell 1.5%, while Nvidia swung between gains and losses, reflecting volatility in AI-linked stocks.Shares of Meta were flat, Nvidia slipped 0.1% at one stage and Palantir Technologies fell 0.3%.“The rut in the technology and AI stocks is continuing this morning,” said Peter Cardillo of Spartan Capital Securities, as quoted by news agency AFP.“Investors are beginning to question: How long is it going to take for this spending to mature?” he added. “When you have an excessive amount of momentum in one sector, usually this is what happens. Negative market sentiment is going to have to run its course.”Investors have grown increasingly concerned that companies are pouring excessive amounts into AI infrastructure such as data centers and chips, without immediate clarity on returns.Alphabet, for instance, has said its spending on AI and other investments could double this year to roughly $180 billion.A survey of global fund managers by Bank of America found a record percentage believe companies are “overinvesting”.Sameer Samana, head of global equities and real assets at Wells Fargo Investment Institute, said markets need Big Tech stocks to stabilize and “need to see less sell first/ask questions later behavior from investors.”Chris Larkin, managing director for trading and investing at E-Trade from Morgan Stanley, noted that while the market remains close to record highs, sharp sell-offs have made it feel more fragile.“Overall, the market is still close to records highs, but it may not feel that way to some investors because of the sharp sell-offs that seem to derail upswings almost as soon as they begin,” Larkin said.In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year US Treasury edged up to 4.05% from 4.04% late Friday.Overseas, European markets advanced, while trading in Asia was muted due to Lunar New Year holidays.

Hair transplant costs in Turkey 2026: A transparent breakdown (no hidden fees),https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/hair-transplant-costs-in-turkey-2026-a-transparent-breakdown-no-hidden-fees/articleshow/128420641.cms,"Why Turkey is one of the leading destinations for hair transplant



Understanding the different hair transplant methods

FUE (Follicular Unit Extraction): In this method, single hair roots are taken from the back or sides of the head and moved to the areas where hair is thin or missing. FUE is popular because it leaves very small scars and gives a natural look. The cost of FUE in Turkey is usually between $1,500 and $4,000, depending on the number of hair roots required.



DHI (Direct Hair Implantation): A newer method in which hair roots are inserted directly into the scalp using a special pen-shaped tool. This way is more exact and helps more hair roots survive. Because DHI is more detailed, it usually costs more than FUE. In Turkey, DHI usually costs between $2,000 and $5,500.



Factors that influence hair transplant costs in Turkey

Number of grafts: One of the most significant factors that influences the cost is the number of hair follicles (grafts) that need to be transplanted. Generally, the more grafts required, the higher the cost. For example, if you need a large number of grafts for extensive hair restoration, the price will increase accordingly.



Clinic reputation and surgeon experience: The clinic's name and the doctor's experience also affect the price. Top clinics with famous and skilled doctors may charge more. Still, this can be worth it because experienced doctors are more likely to deliver natural-looking results and fewer complications.



Location: The clinic's location in Turkey can also affect the price. Istanbul, which is the main city for medical visitors, usually has higher prices than smaller cities. Still, the price difference is usually small, and you can get great care anywhere in the country.



All-inclusive packages: Many clinics in Turkey offer packages for international clients that include everything. These packages usually cover the surgery, travel, hotel, and post-surgery care. Even if the price looks higher, these packages often give you more for your money because they include extra services that make things easier.



Why transparency in pricing is crucial

Hair loss is a concern for many individuals, and as hair restoration technology advances, more people are opting for hair transplant surgeries to regain their confidence. One of the most sought-after destinations for these procedures is Turkey, which has become a global leader in hair transplants. But while hair transplant in Turkey offers high-quality services at an affordable price, it’s essential for patients to understand the cost breakdown.Before looking at the costs, it’s important to know why hair transplants in Turkey are so popular. Turkey is known for being affordable, having skilled doctors, and using the latest technology.Hair transplants in Turkey cost a fraction of what they would in other countries, such as the United States or the United Kingdom. Despite this significant price difference, Turkey offers the same high standards of care and expertise, making it the go-to choice for individuals seeking hair restoration procedures.The cost of a hair transplant in Turkey changes based on a few things, like which method is used, how much hair you have lost, and which clinic you pick. The two most common methods for hair transplantation are Follicular Unit Extraction (FUE) and Direct Hair Implantation (DHI). These methods differ in how they are performed and in cost.The price difference between FUE and DHI mostly depends on how skilled the doctor is, what kind of equipment the clinic uses, and how much hair you have lost. Sometimes, DHI costs more because it needs more careful work.While the chosen method plays a significant role in determining cost, other factors also contribute to the overall price of a hair transplant in Turkey. Here’s a breakdown of what you should expect:When choosing a hair transplant in Turkey, clear pricing is very important. Many people from other countries worry about hidden fees or surprise costs. The best clinics in Turkey ensure they provide clear pricing so patients know exactly what to expect before surgery.Good clinics will give you a clear list of all costs, including extras like travel, hotel, and post-surgery care. If a clinic offers a package that includes everything, make sure the price covers the first visit, the surgery, and post-surgery care.You should also be careful with clinics that have very low prices. Even though Turkey is affordable, prices much lower than normal might indicate poor service or doctors with little experience. Always choose quality and skill over just a low price to get the best results.When thinking about a hair transplant in Turkey, Dr. Serkan Aygin’s clinic is one of the best choices for people from other countries. Dr. Aygin is a well-known expert in hair restoration, known for his meticulous work, personal attention, and outstanding results. His clinic offers various hair transplant methods, including FUE and DHI, and uses the latest technology to ensure patients receive the best care.Dr. Aygin’s clinic also promises clear prices, giving you all the information about costs with no hidden fees. With many successful surgeries and thousands of happy patients, Dr. Serkan Aygin’s clinic is a trusted choice for anyone wanting a hair transplant in Turkey.With transparent pricing, skilled doctors, and the latest technology, Turkey continues to attract people from all over the world for medical care. If you want exceptional results, Dr. Serkan Aygin’s clinic gives top care with no hidden fees, making it a great choice for your hair transplant. Whether you choose FUE or DHI, Dr. Serkan Aygin ensures your treatment fits your needs and delivers natural-looking, long-lasting results.","Hair transplants in Turkey cost a fraction of what they would in other countries, such as the United States or the United Kingdom.

China Buys More Russian Crude As India Steps Back

Even as US President Donald Trump wants the world to stop buying crude oil from Russia, China’s purchases of Russian crude are set to hit a new record in February. China’s procurement of Russian crude is expected to rise for a third consecutive month in February, reaching a fresh record as independent refiners increase buying of heavily discounted cargoes.Shipments of Russian oil to China are projected at about 2.07 million barrels per day for February delivery. This is more than January’s estimated 1.7 million barrels per day, based on preliminary assessments by Vortexa Analytics. Separate provisional figures from Kpler indicate imports of roughly 2.083 million barrels per day in February, compared with 1.718 million barrels per day a month earlier.This comes amidst India reducing its intake, according to traders and vessel-tracking data quoted by Reuters.Data from Kpler shows India’s imports of Russian crude are likely to decline further to around 1.159 million barrels per day in February. The reduced demand has pushed Russian crude prices lower, with cargoes for January and February delivery to China trading at discounts of $9 to $11 per barrel to benchmark ICE Brent.These discounts are among the deepest seen in recent years for the Urals grade, which is shipped from European ports and had typically been directed to India because of shorter shipping distances compared with China.Since November, China has overtaken India as Russia’s largest buyer of seaborne crude. Western sanctions linked to the war in Ukraine, along with pressure on New Delhi to advance a trade agreement with the United States, prompted India to scale back Russian oil purchases to a two-year low in December, the Reuters report said.Also Read | Trump removes 25% penal tariff: What happens if India stops buying Russian crude oil? Supplies of Urals, along with other export grades such as Sokol and Varandey, have added to regular shipments of Russia’s flagship ESPO blend exported from the Far East port of Kozmino, which is geographically closer to China. This has intensified competition with rival crude supplies from Iran.Concerns over potential US military action against Iran have unsettled China’s independent refiners, commonly referred to as teapots, which are among the largest buyers globally of oil subject to US sanctions from Russia, Iran and Venezuela.According to a senior Chinese trader who frequently supplies these refiners, Russian crude has recently gained a competitive edge over Iranian oil in terms of processing quality relative to price. The trader noted that the ESPO blend was last traded at discounts of about $8 to $9 per barrel to ICE Brent for March deliveries, while Iranian Light — a comparable grade — was assessed at roughly $10 to $11 below the same benchmark.Market uncertainty since January regarding the possibility of US strikes on Iran, in the event that nuclear negotiations fail to meet Washington’s expectations, has made Chinese teapots and traders more cautious about purchasing Iranian cargoes, said Emma Li, China analyst at Vortexa.She explained that concerns over potential disruptions to Iranian oil loadings in the event of military tensions have made Russian supplies appear more dependable to buyers. Li also indicated that part of the recent increase in Russian crude purchases has come from larger independent refiners located outside Shandong, the main hub for teapot refiners.Vortexa estimated that Iranian oil shipments to China, often labelled as Malaysian by traders to bypass US sanctions, declined to around 1.03 million barrels per day this month, compared with approximately 1.25 million barrels per day in January.","China’s procurement of Russian crude is expected to rise for a third consecutive month in February.

Asian markets showed little movement on Monday as several trading floors closed for Lunar New Year celebrations. Japan's disappointing economic growth of just 0.1 per cent in late 2025 added pressure on newly elected Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi. Meanwhile, US markets will stay shut for Presidents' Day, and gold prices dipped slightly after reaching $5,000 per ounce.The holiday closures affected mainland China, Seoul, and Taipei, while Hong Kong and Singapore operated only half-day sessions. The slow trading day followed a tech sector decline last week, triggered by worries about massive AI infrastructure investments.Japan's weak GDP numbers fell short of the expected 0.4% growth, creating challenges for Takaichi, who won recent elections promising economic improvement.""The weak growth implies that the large supplementary budget passed at the end of November provided no boost to public spending last quarter just yet,"" said Marcel Thieliant at Capital Economics. He suggested Takaichi might need to act quickly on tax reforms and new budgets.Most Asian markets saw minor losses. Tokyo dropped 0.03%, while Hong Kong managed a 0.4% gain. The market mood improved after US inflation data showed a bigger-than-expected cooling in January.The AI Impact Summit in New Delhi, featuring tech leaders like OpenAI's Sam Altman and Google's Sundar Pichai, starts Monday. The event comes amid growing concerns about AI's social and environmental impacts, despite its role in boosting tech company profits.""US inflation data was good. And the initial response in equities reflected that. But the devil was in the details,"" noted Kyle Rodda, adding that core inflation hit its lowest level since March 2021 at 2.4%.In precious metals, gold's slight decline came after Friday's gains. Standard Chartered's note remained optimistic: ""We expect gold to remain well supported,"" citing expectations of Federal Reserve rate cuts supporting gold demand.","Japan's disappointing economic growth of just 0.1 per cent in late 2025 added pressure on newly elected Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi.

Bank operations on Presidents Day

What else is closed

The United States is observing Presidents Day on Monday, Feb. 16, a federal holiday honouring the country’s presidents, especially George Washington. As Americans mark the occasion, one of the common question is what services, like Banking, etc. , remain open and what's shutdown.Since Presidents Day is one of the official federal holidays in the US, several essential services, including government offices and financial institutions, suspend regular operations. Customers planning in-person banking or financial transactions may face closures and delays.Bank branches across the US will remain closed, as financial institutions observe the federal holiday. Major banks such as Capital One, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, PNC, Chase, Truist and Citibank will not operate their physical branches on Monday.However, customers can continue using digital banking services. Online banking platforms, mobile apps and ATMs will remain functional, allowing users to check balances, transfer funds and withdraw cash. Normal branch operations are expected to resume on Tuesday, Feb.17.Apart from banks, Several other services will be unavailable on Presidents Day. Government offices and post offices will remain closed, and there will be no regular mail delivery. Financial markets, including the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq, will also remain shut in observance of the holiday.Most public schools and federal institutions will be closed as well, although policies may vary by district and university. Meanwhile, grocery stores, retail outlets and restaurants are generally expected to remain open and operate during regular business hours.Presidents Day, officially known as Washington’s Birthday, was established in 1879 to honour Washington and is now widely recognised as a day to celebrate all US presidents.","The US is observing Presidents Day on Monday, Feb. 16.

'Harsh Lesson': Iran Threatens U.S. Of Deadly Retaliation If Islamic Republic Is Attacked

Global oil prices remained steady on Monday as markets closely watch upcoming talks between United States and Iran. While concerns over potential disruptions in oil supply due to US-Iran tensions kept prices stable, OPEC+ is considering increasing production from April. The day saw Brent crude futures slightly down at $67.72 per barrel, while US WTI crude stood at $62.86.The market's cautious stance comes ahead of crucial negotiations between Washington and Tehran in Geneva on Tuesday. These talks aim to resolve their long-running dispute over Iran's nuclear program. Both benchmarks had declined last week after US President Donald Trump suggested a possible deal with Iran within a month.An Iranian diplomat revealed that Iran seeks a nuclear agreement offering mutual economic benefits, including investments in energy and mining sectors, along with aircraft purchases. However, market analyst Tony Sycamore said, ""With both sides expected to hold firm on their core red lines, expectations are low that a deal can be reached and this is likely to be the calm before the storm,"" as quoted by Reuters.Military tensions have escalated, with the US deploying a second aircraft carrier to the region.However, Iran's Revolutionary Guards have threatened to retaliate against US military bases if their territory is attacked.Meanwhile, OPEC+ is considering resuming oil production increases after a three-month pause to meet summer demand.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

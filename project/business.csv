About Swiggy

Swiggy IPO : Food delivery and quick commerce platform Swiggy’s IPO worth Rs 11,324 crore opens today. It consists of Rs 4,500 crore fresh issue and remaining as an offer for sale. Without a specific promoter, various institutional investors including Accel India, Apoletto Asia, Alpha Wave Ventures, DST Euro Asia, and Norwest Venture Partners are selling portions of their holdings. The fresh issue funds will support debt repayment, dark store expansion, technological improvements, marketing, and acquisition strategies.Investors can participate in the IPO until November 8. The company has established a price range of Rs 371-390 per share, with a minimum lot size of 38 shares and additional investments in multiples thereof.The company's shares currently show a Grey Market Premium (GMP) of Rs 12 in unofficial trading, suggesting a modest 3% premium above the issue price.The Swiggy IPO implies a market capitalization of Rs 87,299 crore, valuing Swiggy at 7.7 times FY24 annualized revenues, compared to Zomato's 17 times multiple.While Zomato achieved profitability in FY24 after three years of listing, Swiggy remains unprofitable and faces competition in quick commerce, according to an ET analysis. Despite these challenges, India's quick commerce potential makes this IPO attractive for long-term investors, though business execution risks persist, the analysis says.Market analysts have diverse opinions regarding the Swiggy IPO, considering the company's present financial condition, market competition, and valuation metrics. However, the food delivery sector's growth potential makes it a considerable option for long-term investors.""As of the fiscal year 2024, Swiggy continues to operate at a loss, in contrast to its competitor, Zomato, which has recently achieved profitability. We advise investors to Avoid this IPO until the company's financial performance and growth outlook improve. Waiting until Swiggy demonstrates improved financial results and a clearer path to sustainable growth would be a more prudent investment approach,"" said Samco Securities.""Swiggy, at an upper price band of Rs 390.0, is valued at Price/Sales, EV/Sales and P/BV multiple of 7.8x/7.3x/7.1x respectively of its FY24 financials on post issue capital. While comparing with Zomato, the issue appears to be fairly priced on all these parameters. We recommend investors to subscribe to the issue for a long term investment perspective,"" said SBI Securities.The Bengaluru company, established in 2014 for food delivery, expanded to quick commerce in 2020. Its unified application offers multiple services: food delivery, Instamart for groceries, Dineout for restaurant bookings, SteppinOut for events, and Genie for pickup services.

What will Donald Trump as US President mean for Indian stock markets? Top advantages & disadvantages,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/what-will-donald-trump-as-us-president-mean-for-indian-stock-markets-top-advantages-disadvantages/articleshow/115005808.cms,"India stands to potentially benefit from this situation, with improved prospects for Foreign Portfolio Investment.

Benefits of Trump's Potential Victory for India

Indian export sectors could gain significant advantages if Trump wins, as higher tariffs on Chinese products may enhance competitiveness of Indian manufacturers in areas like auto parts, solar equipment, and chemical production in US markets.

Energy costs might decrease due to Trump's fossil fuel policies and expected slower Chinese economic growth. This could positively impact Indian oil companies like HPCL, BPCL, IOC, and gas distribution firms such as IGL and MGL.

Manufacturing and defense sectors could experience growth as Trump's emphasis on US industrial development may benefit companies operating in both countries, including ABB, Siemens, Cummins, Honeywell, GE T&D, and Hitachi Energy.

Resolution of international tensions under Trump could improve supply chain efficiency, aiding Indian businesses. His focus on strengthening US manufacturing and military capabilities could provide opportunities for Indian defense companies like Bharat Dynamics and HAL.

The business climate could improve with Trump's leadership, potentially benefiting Indian equity markets through reduced corporate taxation, fewer regulatory requirements, and business-friendly policies.

Disadvantages for India due to Trump's Return:

A Trump presidency could trigger inflation, affecting Indian businesses through higher interest rates and increased costs for US-sourced materials and equipment. Economic experts anticipate that his proposed policies on tariffs, deportation, and deficit spending could cause inflationary pressures, resulting in immediate price increases and wage adjustments.

Trump's economic policies could strengthen the US dollar and increase bond yields through tax reductions and fiscal measures. This would attract global capital to the US, potentially weakening emerging market currencies including the Indian rupee. A stronger dollar would increase India's import expenses, particularly for oil, leading to higher domestic inflation.

Despite possible initial market gains, Trump's policy uncertainties could create extended market instability. Previous data shows US markets outperformed Indian markets during his first term, with Nasdaq gaining 77% compared to Nifty's 38%.

Previous restrictions on H-1B visas under Trump affected Indian IT companies through increased rejection rates and costs. However, these companies have adapted by increasing local US hiring and green card holders, reducing their vulnerability to future immigration restrictions.

Trump has criticized India's trade policies and suggested reciprocal tariffs. His administration could pressure India to reduce trade barriers, affecting sectors like IT, pharmaceuticals, and textiles. However, his efforts to reduce Chinese manufacturing dependence could benefit India.

The anticipated increase in the US fiscal deficit under Trump could lead to global inflation and higher interest rates, creating challenges for emerging markets' monetary policies. While India's domestic-focused economy provides some buffer, a Harris victory would likely maintain current economic frameworks with minimal disruption.

US election results : Republican candidate Donald Trump is projected to defeat Democrat candidate Kamala Harris in the US presidential elections, as per the latest counting trends. Indian equity markets have responded positively to Trump’s potential win. But what will the long-term impact of Trump at the White House be for Indian stock markets?A Republican sweep might trigger a short-term upswing in stock markets, primarily due to gains in US equity markets, as per Emkay Global's analysis.The Chinese markets, however, are expected to face heightened volatility and uncertainty during this period.India appears to be among the primary beneficiaries of Trump's presidency, particularly concerning economic and foreign policy matters. As Nomura's Sonal Verma states, ""We see India as a relative beneficiary, due to its domestic demand-driven growth model and benefits from lower commodity prices, supply chain shifts and on foreign policy.""The advantages India stands to gain from the current supply chain reorganisation, as companies reduce their dependence on China during Trump's administration, are likely to outweigh any potential challenges related to trade and immigration policies, according to Verma.According to an ET analysis, India stands to potentially benefit from this situation, with improved prospects for Foreign Portfolio Investment positioning and increased capital flows, according to the brokerage firm's assessment.

DA Hike Calculator: How much will the take home salary increase?

To understand the impact of this 3% DA hike, let's consider an example:

Assuming a central government employee has a basic pay of Rs 46,200, their previous dearness allowance at 50% was Rs 23,100. With the DA now at 53%, their dearness allowance will increase to Rs 24,486.

This means they will receive an additional Rs 1,386 (Rs 24,486 - Rs 23,100) in DA from October. As the DA hike is effective from July 1, 2024, they will also receive arrears for the last three months.

DR Hike Calculator: How much will the pension increase?

If a central government pensioner receives a basic pension of Rs 50,400 per month, at the previous 50% DR, they were getting Rs 25,200.

With the DR now at 53%, they will receive Rs 26,712 monthly as dearness relief. This means their pension will increase by Rs 1,512 per month.

Additionally, the dearness relief (DR) for central government pensioners has also been raised by 3%.

This decision is set to benefit over 1 crore individuals.The dearness allowance, a component of the salary for government employees and pensioners, has been increased to 53%.

Premium products, in fact, drove the bulk of sales for the company, which claims to have recorded a 34% year-on-year growth in sales value in the recently concluded festive season. ""Alongside, we also witnessed healthy volume growth of 27% (for watches), clearly indicating that consumer appetite for premium timepieces remains robust despite inflationary pressures,"" Rahul Shukla, VP and chief sales & marketing officer (watches & wearables) at Titan, told TOI.Inflation typically impacts the lower strata of society, those who allot their budgets towards essentials when there is an uptick in the general price level. Mirroring the trend seen over the past few years, premium has been the flavour this festive season too - across categories ranging from fashion to electronics. For Godrej Appliances, ACs grew by 49% while fully automatic front-load washing machines were among the top-selling products. ""Discretionary spending continues to hold steady, especially for premium households,"" said Kamal Nandi, business head & executive VP at the company which saw a 50% YoY growth in sales in October.Haier saw heavy demand for its premium range like AI-enabled refrigerators, washing machines and air fryer microwaves while Voltas recorded good sales of its 'smartair' ACs.

A study by logistics intelligence platform ClickPost showed that online platforms clocked electronics orders with an average order value of Rs 38,000 driven by personal tech and smart home gadgets.Although overall retail sales rose during the festive season, the growth rates were slower. Nomura estimates that sales grew at a slower 15% YoY in 2024 compared to 32% in 2023 and 88% in 2022.

The foreign broking major reversed its previous tactical allocation decision, shifting back from China to India. Its analysts cited three key factors for changing its position on China.First, ""Trump 2.0 heralds a trade war escalation just as exports become the largest contributor to China's growth. The NPC (National People's Congress) stimulus amounts to de-risking with little reflationary benefit,"" the report said. ""Higher US yields and inflation expectations sap scope for the (US central bank) and thus (Chinese central bank) to ease. We are anxious that these concerns lead to a buyers' strike by offshore investors who built China exposure after the initial PBoC (Chinese central bank) stimulus in Sept.""Analysts at CLSA feel that India stands out as one of the regional markets least vulnerable to Trump's unfavourable trade policies. Additionally, with stable energy prices, India potentially offers relative foreign exchange stability during a period of US dollar strengthening.""Paradoxically, India has seen strong net foreign investor selling since October, while investors we met this year have been waiting specifically for such a buying opportunity to address Indian underexposure. Domestic appetite remains strong, offsetting foreign jitters, and valuation, though pricey, is now a little more palatable,"" the report said.CLSA, however, has a caveat for India. Calling it ""suffering from success: The risk of suffocation by primary flow"", the report pointed out that at present fund mobilisation in India through IPOs and secondary offers combined has reached 1.5% of market cap.

Railway Budget 2024 : The government has wavered little in its efforts to spur a modernisation of railways in the country, pivoting on technology, to support the country’s economic ambitions. In line with expectations, Union Budget 2024-25 set the capex for railways at a record Rs 2.65 lakh crore, marking yet another year of successive increase in outlay. That takes forward the past policies and the government’s vision, which have paved the way for modernisation of the transport behemoth.In earlier decades, the government had focused on laying tracks on new routes, electrification and incremental rolling stock capacity addition. That was the need of the hour back then and has helped set up the base for a larger transformation.For instance, the massive Dedicated Freight Corridor ( DFC ) as well as locomotive factories at Marhaura and Madhepura in Bihar were conceptualised over a decade ago and we are seeing their completion now.More recently, the focus has shifted to modernisation—of rolling stock and safety systems, among other aspects.This year, emphasis has also been laid on the railways’ crucial role in industrial development. Commodity-specific corridors have been planned in eastern India and impetus given to port connectivity. Vande Bharat and technology-led upgrades in rolling stock remain in focus. Safety has been prioritised through budgetary allocations for the anti-collision systemKavach . That said, there are other cogs in the wheel that demand attention from a long-term perspective.First, the target for the Operating Ratio, the crucial efficiency gauge, has been set at 98.22% for 2024-25, compared with 98.65% in 2023-24. This reflects an imminent need for operational transformation. An effective overhaul of the world’s fourth-largest rail network will take many years and thus we need to start focusing on improving efficiency and reducing costs now.DFC is almost entirely operational and will be complete over the next few months. To ensure the project achieves its twin goals of reducing logistics costs and enhancing freight efficiency, railways need to attract more cargo on the corridor. This will help increase the rail coefficient and make the railways’ approach more market-oriented, which will in turn aid future corridors.A revamp of railway stations is on track, with sufficient funds dedicated to this end. But even though new coaches and wagons are increasingly being added to meet footfalls, the stations and passenger trains themselves remain synonymous with chaos.Just as safety, comfort and convenience have been prioritised, there is a need for solutions to address the capacity and demand challenges. As a first step, the government could target development of new stations and setting up of new coach production units.As a leading freight mover, Indian Railways carried a record 1,588 MT cargo in fiscal 2024, up from 1,095 MT in fiscal 2015. It accounts for 26% of the cargo moved in the country—by no means an easy feat. The railways aims to take this volume to 3,000 MT by 2030, which would require a 11% CAGR against the around 4.2% witnessed over the last 10 years. As per a report by TERI and Shakti Foundation, from carrying about 62% of freight traffic in 1990-91, Indian Railways’ share has declined to ~27% in 2014-15. This has been due to the expanding road network, cost competitiveness over railways, and door-to-door service. Thus, commencing the cycle of increasing the rail share again is commendable.DFCs, a high-capacity track network, high-power locomotives and improvement in wagon designs have set the ball rolling for larger capacity, faster freight trains that deliver better efficiency.Yet, achieving exponential growth is a tall ask given the current dynamics. Possibly, similar challenges might apply to other goals the railways might have for 2047.To be fair, despite its scale and complexity, Indian Railways has been able to achieve diverse developments at commendable speed.But the track ahead is long and it is time to start discussing the reinvention of the institutional set-up.Indian Railways sees substantial private sector involvement in the form of vendors and contractors. Policymakers could start mulling extreme options such as parallel privately-owned and operated railway infrastructure, coupled with centralised planning and an evolved role for the railways. This will need a robust policy framework from the Government of India.The time is perhaps also ripe to bring user charge and asset monetisation-driven segments for passengers as well as cargo to the discussion table. Globally, the separation of infrastructure and operations in railways has delivered mixed results, for example in the United Kingdom. The model should be analysed and revisited to understand its potential relevance in the Indian context.The key would be to retrace our steps and align our long-term goals to identify not just incremental changes but also ways to explore bold and path-breaking alternatives that put Indian Railways on a smooth track and bring it up to speed.","Union Budget 2024-25 set the capex for railways at a record Rs 2.65 lakh crore.

Budget 2024 capital gains tax changes: The Narendra Modi government is considering suggestions for tweaks in the new long term capital gains tax regime that was announced by FM Nirmala Sitharaman in Union Budget 2024.The July 23 budget reduced the LTCG tax on property from 20% to 12.5%. The indexation benefit, which allowed taxpayers to adjust the acquisition cost for inflation before calculating capital gains and thus reduce their tax liability, is proposed to be eliminated for properties purchased on or after April 1, 2001. The government publishes the Cost Inflation Index (CII) annually for this calculation.India Inc is appealing to the government for a gradual shift to the long-term capital gains tax regime proposed in the FY25 budget, which aims to eliminate indexation benefits for property, gold, and other unlisted assets.According to an ET report by Deepshikha Sikarwar, the industry is suggesting alternatives such as a higher tax rate with indexation or a lower rate of 12.5% without indexation, as well as some form of grandfathering for ancestral properties.The finance ministry is currently reviewing these proposals and will discuss them with the Prime Minister's Office.

Budget 2024 for manufacturing sector : The recent Union Budget has struck a balance between fiscal consolidation and stimulating economic growth. While the middle class has been offered tax relief, the government's primary focus remains on judicious spending to maximize economic impact. The budget's core themes are employment, skilling, MSME development, and support for the middle class.Largely focus has remained intact on spending money judiciously to ensure that each penny spent creates a ripple effect in the entire economic landscape.Although at first glance, manufacturing might appear to have taken a backseat, a deeper analysis reveals a multifaceted approach to bolstering the sector. Initiatives like employment-linked benefits and internship programs, while primarily aimed at job creation and skill development, indirectly benefit manufacturing companies by expanding the talent pool.Extensive focus on the MSME manufacturing units by way of extending term loan facility for purchase of machinery and equipment without collateral or third-party guarantee, would help companies in augmenting their capital base/ capacity and strengthen the very foundation of the manufacturing ecosystem in the country. Development of a new credit-assessment model by Public Sector Banks to assess MSME credit shall provide much needed regulatory relief to the units.With respect to the large manufacturing entities, while there is no direct fiscal/ tax incentive introduced in this budget, some support has been provided with an extensive focus on development of ‘industrial parks’ in nearly 100 cities under the ‘plug and play’ model. Reforms proposed with respect to land administration, planning and management, shall also ease out acquisition related difficulties often faced by entrepreneurs/ business houses in acquiring lands for manufacturing set-ups.Targeted Customs duty interventions like, rationalization of Customs duty provisions in Mobile phone manufacturing setups, extension of Customs duty exemption on import of capital goods for manufacturing of solar cells and panels, full Customs duty exemption on import of 25 critical minerals,, shall provide the required impetus for enhancing domestic manufacturing environment.Governments’ focus on formulating an Economic Policy Framework to set the scope for next-gen reforms in the country, has a target to improve the productivity of factors of production, namely, land, labour, capital, entrepreneurship and technology. This shall pave the way for enabling achievement of a target of 25% manufacturing sector contribution to the nation’s GDP over the course of next 7-10 years.While the overall outlook is positive, the extension of tax benefits under Section 115BAB for manufacturing entities and the absence of new PLI schemes are notable omissions.The country’s manufacturing base is expanding as is reflective from the continuously increasing tax collections and expanding Purchasing Manager’s Index. It would be pertinent to see how the ground realities evolve vis-à-vis the vision envisaged, in the upcoming Financial Year.","While the overall outlook is positive, the extension of tax benefits under Section 115BAB for manufacturing entities and the absence of new PLI schemes are notable omissions.

Budget 2024: Armed with the vision to propel India to become a developed country by 2047, the Union Budget 2024 aims to focus largely towards strengthening the Make in India initiative and ease of doing business thereby providing the required stimulus to the manufacturing sector and enabling large scale job creation.On the Indirect tax front, the industry welcomes the much-needed announcement for a comprehensive review of the rate structure under Customs enabling ease in product classification and dispute reduction. The proposal of lowering of Customs duty on a plethora of raw materials and products including solar cells, critical minerals and bullion are encouraging measures. The rationale behind such reduction clearly indicates support towards domestic manufacturing, deepening value addition and supporting targets in reducing carbon footprint.Relevant amendments under the Customs law have been made to provide increased time limits for re-imports and re-exports to enhance competitiveness of the fledgling MRO sector. The government has extended significant duty reduction and exemption benefits to the healthcare and electronics sectors, continuing the impetus of incentives provided under the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme.Since their introduction in March 2020, the PLI schemes have indeed supported in revitalizing the manufacturing sector and strengthening the necessary supply chains. The success achieved in the mobile manufacturing sector has now enabled the Government to reduce customs duties on mobile phones and components, signalling a mature environment. The Budget proposals aim at reproducing similar outcomes for semiconductor and pharmaceutical industry by increasing the budgetary allocation.Buoyed by the increasing revenue collection under GST signalling a shift towards a mature tax regime, this Budget has harmonized the timeframes for the issuance of demand notices and adjudication orders for cases involving fraud, suppression or otherwise. Significant amendments to the GST legislations have been introduced reflecting the recommendations proposed by the GST Council such as regularizing non-levy of GST due to general practice which may turn out to be a breather for certain impacted industries reeling under huge tax demands.The Insurance sector has been provided much relief through the GST council recommendations which have been cemented in the present budget thereby ending long standing disputes on their business practices.The Government's efforts to push forward with its reform agenda are evident as plans to incentivize states for their business reform actions plans and digitalization through the Jan Vishwas Bill 2.0 is proposed. Further, setting up of e-commerce export hubs is envisaged to facilitate easier access to international markets for domestic players.The recent implementation of Budget proposals allows the government to maintain momentum in its reform agenda. These policy measures implicitly reaffirm the significance of India Inc as a crucial element in the development of infrastructure. However, there are still some expectations required to be met to march towards a Viksit Bharat 2047.","Union Budget 2024 aims to focus largely towards strengthening the Make in India initiative.

Budget 2024 : Real estate, a significant contributor to employment generation, has received a fair bit of attention in Budget 2024-25. Recent years have seen the sector transform rapidly, driven by factors such as favourable government policies, Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016, strong economic growth and changing consumer preferences.Added to that, the budgetary focus on job creation, skilling and employment-linked incentives, infrastructure, urban development, rural connectivity, digitalisation and land-related norms, all dovetail to promote growth of the sector.Launched in June 2015, the PMAY aims to provide affordable housing to all eligible beneficiaries. The budget unveiled PMAY Urban 2.0, under which the housing needs of 1 crore urban poor and middle class will be addressed with an investment of Rs 10 lakh crore.The central government’s additional Rs 2.2 lakh crore injection in the next 5 years to make housing more affordable has the potential to revitalise the affordable housing market.Such an approach can play an important role in realising the government's vision of Housing for All and push growth and development. Hence, the significant investment under PMAY Urban 2.0 is expected to alleviate urban housing deficits, spurring construction and economic growth.Steps to introduce technological reforms within the regulatory framework for land, such as digitalisation or GIS mapping of land records, will improve transparency.Rationalisation of stamp duty across states will also be critical to bring in uniformity and initiate land-related reforms such as urban planning, usage and building bylaws.These are steps in the right direction and will boost growth. Moreover, they will improve the ease of property transactions and strengthen municipal finances through increased property taxes. Rationalization of stamp duty with an emphasis on women homebuyers may boost home-buyer sentiment in major cities, too.The budget has also given ample attention to urban and rural development, with rental housing for industrial workers through the public private partnership model, interest subsidies for rental housing, and transit-oriented developments.The proposal to develop investment-ready plug-and-play industrial parks in 100 cities may attract industrial investment, leading to increased demand for industrial real estate and support the growth of ancillary services and residential developments in these regions.Initiatives for industrial parks and rental housing for industrial workers align with the country’s manufacturing goals and addresses worker accommodation needs.These steps are expected to promote industrial growth and stability in labour-intensive sectors, while also creating new opportunities for real estate developers specialising in rental and affordable housing.The changes in long-term capital gains (LTCG) tax, however, have evoked a mixed reaction. The government lowered the long-term capital gains tax from 20% to 12.5%, which is a welcome step. However, this came with the removal of the indexation benefit.The changes could encourage more liquidity in property transactions and potentially increase the effective tax burden depending on the property’s acquisition date.The launch of Phase IV of the PM Gram Sadak Yojana in 25,000 rural habitations will improve connectivity in rural areas, promoting rural development and making these regions more accessible for investment. The primary objective of PMGSY is to build robust, all-weather roads in rural habitations. This initiative focuses on enhancing connectivity and supporting economic development in rural areas.In essence, the budget is geared towards stimulating growth and investment in the real estate sector , fostering a more transparent and investor-friendly environment, and contributing to overall development. It aims to create a balanced and inclusive growth environment by addressing the needs of various segments, including affordable housing, industrial workers and urban infrastructure.The effectiveness of the initiatives, however, hinges on their implementation and continued support of complementary reforms.",The central government’s additional Rs 2.2 lakh crore injection in the next 5 years to make housing more affordable has the potential to revitalise the affordable housing market.

New Budget 2024 rule: Why Income Tax Department is likely to issue a huge number of tax notices this month,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/new-budget-2024-rule-why-income-tax-department-is-likely-to-issue-a-huge-number-of-tax-notices-this-month/articleshow/112186079.cms,"Taxing Times

Income Tax Notice on the way? The Income Tax Department is gearing up to send out a large number of notices in the coming month, as there are concerns that many taxpayers might escape the tax net due to the impending implementation of the new reassessment law on September 1, 2024.According to the amended regulation announced in Budget 2024 , the tax authorities can only go back a maximum of five years to reassess a taxpayer's records if the escaped income is at least Rs 50 lakh, and three years for an amount less than Rs 50 lakh.Previously, they could reassess cases up to 10 years old.According to an ET report, tax officials are now faced with the challenge of compiling and corroborating data on tax and income mismatches for the financial years 2013-14 to 2017-18 within the next few weeks, as these years will become time-barred for reassessment from September 1, 2024.The I-T department relies on information from various sources, such as banks, property registrars, and search findings from the investigation wing, to build reassessment cases.A tax officers' body has raised concerns about the feasibility of issuing notices under Section 148 (or 148A) in a large number of cases within a single month, given the overburdened nature of the jurisdictional assessing officers and the time-consuming process of obtaining sanction from the chief commissioner, who is the specified authority for such notices.Moreover, the law provides taxpayers with the right to explain their position before reassessment orders are finalized, a process that most believe cannot be completed by the end of August.Also Read | ITR refund status for FY 2023-24: How to check income tax refund status online - here’s a step-by-step guide for incometax.gov.in & NSDL websites The Central Board of Direct Taxes ( CBDT ) has been urged by its officers to postpone the effective date of the proposed amendment. However, this suggestion is unlikely to be well-received by corporations and high net worth individuals.""Capping the reassessment period at five years was a great decision as it would reduce hassles and litigation. But if the department fears there could be a genuine loss of revenue as it may not be possible to wrap up several matters by August 31, the government can think of strict parameters where time-bound cases can be selectively reopened - based on trails of steps taken in identifying escaped income,"" said Mitil Chokshi, partner at CA firm Chokshi & Chokshi.""Taxpayers may expect a rush of reassessment notices in August 2024. These notices are likely to be for the AYs 2018-19 and prior to that. It is pertinent to note that the Bombay High Court in a recent ruling in a case of Hexaware Technologies has taken a view on a proviso introduced in 2021, which can be interpreted to mean that AY 2017-18 (and prior years) got time barred on March 31, 2024. These reassessment notices (for AYs 2017-18 and prior) are likely to rake up new interpretation issues in the already muddled reassessment provisions,"" said Ashish Mehta, partner at law firm Khaitan & Co.The current situation is similar to the conflict between the Income Tax office and taxpayers in 2021. The reassessment law was amended in April 2021, allowing the tax office to reopen 10-year-old tax returns if the total undisclosed income exceeded Rs 50 lakh and reassess 4-year-old matters if the amount was less than Rs 50 lakh.Also Read | Latest NPS rules 2024: How much tax will you save with new NPS contribution benefit under new regime after Budget 2024? However, this change led to over 10,000 writ petitions being filed by companies, arguing that they were not given sufficient time to explain and that the notices were issued without considering the carve-out that cases which couldn't be reopened earlier couldn't be reassessed under the new law.The Supreme Court invoked its extraordinary powers under Article 142 of the Constitution on May 4, 2022, to uphold all reassessment notices issued after March 31, 2021. However, the court left room for judicial proceedings based on the merits of each case, and several such matters are currently pending before the court.","The Income Tax Department is gearing up to send out a large number of notices in the coming month.

How NPS will increase tax savings

NPS and EPF: Overlapping services

What is NPS Vatsalaya?

Latest NPS rules, news: In the Union Budget 2024 speech, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced two new initiatives with regard to National Pension Scheme (NPS) - extension of NPS 14% employer contribution benefits to private setcor and the intended launch of NPS Vatsalya.Budget 2024 announced the hiking of the tax deduction limit on private sector employers’ contributions to NPS from 10% to 14% of employees’ basic salaries, bringing it at par with the provisions available for government employees.Sriram Iyer, CEO, HDFC Pension Management told ET that with this move the “ground rules have been harmonised among government and non-government employees, which is a positive step.”Effectively, this means that now, private-sector employees can choose to reduce the taxable portion of employers’ contribution to their NPS corpus, thereby paying less tax and leaving greater funds in their pension deposits.“Employees will benefit from tax savings . More importantly, the 40% increase in contribution will have a significant impact on the terminal value of the retirement corpus,” remarked Iyer. The extended savings will “help in retirement planning, working as an option that is at par with the Provident Fund,” Dinesh Rohira, CEO & Founder, 5nance.com was quoted as saying.Moreover, the endeavour aims to increase NPS penetration by increasing tax incentives for the private sector, providing them a social security-cushion post-retirement.The scheme’s motive to widen the NPS subscriber base may not prove to be flawlessly effective, however. This is explained by Agrees Mrin Agarwal, Founder, Finsafe India: “While it’s good that the limit has been raised, it may not increase adoption as employees need to be educated in a big way. Also, the benefit is only for the salaried opting for the new tax regime,” she says.The mandatory contribution to the EPF, too, threatens to relegate the provisions of NPS under the umbrella of near-superfluity. This sentiment is echoed by Varun Sahay, a software engineer in a Delhi-based IT company: “When 12% of my salary is already deducted for the EPF, why should I put in more in the NPS and cut my take-home pay?”Rohira feels otherwise. “There’s no competition between the NPS and EPF as employees can contribute to both and build a 3-4 times bigger corpus while earning 3-4% higher returns via marketlinked options in the NPS,” he counters.Also Check | New Tax Regime 2023 vs 2024 After Budget: How Much Income Tax Will Salaried Taxpayers Save & How Do New Tax Slabs Compare To Old Regime? Top 10 Points You Must Know To jumpstart retirement savings for children, a new initiative called NPS Vatsalya has been unveiled in the Budget. This scheme allows parents and guardians to contribute to a minor's account, which can be converted into a regular NPS account once the child reaches adulthood.""It provides a very long duration for reaping the compounding benefits and accumulating a huge bounty at a later age. This can be a good way to plan a better future for kids who may not opt for a service segment in the future,"" says Rohira. Sriram Iyer agrees, stating, ""It’s a good move to help the child start his retirement journey. Even if a parent starts when the child is 10 years old, by the time he starts working, it can be a solid foundation for the compounding journey after that.""However, some experts question the utility of a product with such a long lock-in period, especially when parents cannot use the funds for essential goals like their child’s education amidst soaring education costs of 11-12%.""Parents are struggling to save for their own retirement, so it might be a bit of a stretch to expect them to save for their kids’ retirement. The need of the hour is a market-linked product that allows withdrawals only for the child’s education,"" says Mrin Agarwal, Founder of Finsafe India.Also Read | Latest NPS rules 2024: How much tax will you save with new NPS contribution benefit under new regime after Budget 2024? Though the NPS permits partial withdrawals, it allows only 25% of the corpus after three years of joining, and this can be done only three times during the entire tenure. A premature exit before 60 years with 100% withdrawal is only possible if the corpus is less than Rs.2.5 lakh, an amount insufficient for most children's goals.""In its current form, there won’t be any uptake,"" asserts Agarwal. Rohira concurs, ""It’s a vanilla product with a lock-in, which does not make it very attractive and it may not take off. However, the government may optimise it and introduce new features later."" Iyer adds, ""This is just a start and there may be more subscriber-friendly features as we take it to the market. The regulator is proactive and open to feedback.""","Budget 2024 announced the hiking of the tax deduction limit on private sector employers’ contributions to NPS from 10% to 14% of employees’ basic salaries.

Gold import duty cut: Why Indians may not find buying gold from Dubai as attractive post Budget 2024,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gold-import-duty-cut-why-indians-may-not-find-buying-gold-from-dubai-as-attractive-post-budget-2024/articleshow/112097671.cms,"Gold import duty cut: Joy Alukkas, chairman of Joy Alukkas Group, estimates that nearly 50% of their UAE business will shift to India.

Gold import duty cut in Budget 2024: The recent reduction in customs duty on gold imports in the Union Budget 2024 is expected to significantly impact the gold shopping habits of Indian consumers who frequently visit Dubai. Indian jewellers with stores in both India and the UAE believe that the narrowed duty differential will result in lower gold prices in India, making it less attractive for Indians to purchase gold in Dubai.The emirate had attracted gold-enthusiast Indians following a steep rise in customs duty in India in July 2022. In the fiscal 2024-25 budget, the duty on gold imports was more than halved.The duty cut is also expected to boost gold jewellery production in India, particularly the popular 'Kolkatti' jewellery from Kolkata, which is favored by Indian expats in Dubai and tourists from various countries. This move will encourage gold artisans to create new designs in both heavyweight and lightweight jewellery, attracting consumers to purchase gold from India.According to an ET report, Joy Alukkas, chairman of Joy Alukkas Group , estimates that nearly 50% of their UAE business will shift to India as Indian tourists who previously bought jewellery in Dubai will now prefer to shop in India. However, Indian expats living in Dubai and other customers may continue to buy from the UAE.Also Read | Gold losing sheen? Government cuts gold bond issuance target as investors look at better alternatives Rajiv Popley, director at Popley & Sons, believes that the perception of overseas gold being cheaper than in India is merely a mindset. He points out that the labour cost is significantly lower in India, and with the introduction of mandatory hallmarking and HUID numbers, the purity of gold in India is no longer a concern.Furthermore, NRIs in Dubai do not receive VAT refunds, and Indians travelling abroad only receive about 60% of the VAT back on their gold purchases. Gold trade analyst Bhargav Baidya suggests that the 1% duty differential between gold jewellery in India and Dubai will be offset by Indian jewellers offering discounts to retain and attract customers.Saurabh Gadgil, chairman of PNG Jewellers, notes that Indian import duty is now on par with the US, allowing Indian jewellers to offer competitive prices compared to other countries worldwide. The reduced customs duty is expected to make gold purchases in India more attractive and convenient for Indian consumers, potentially leading to a significant shift in their gold shopping preferences.","The reduction in customs duty on gold imports in the Union Budget 2024 is expected to significantly impact the gold shopping habits of Indian consumers.

Gold Bonds losing sheen

Gold losing sheen? The government has reduced its target for issuing gold bonds in the financial year 2024-25 by 38% compared to the previous interim budget goal, according to a senior official. The revised target stands at Rs 18,500 crore, down from Rs 29,638 crore estimated in the interim budget and Rs 26,852 crore (revised estimate) in 2023-24.The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told ET ""The decision followed a reassessment of various factors, including investor demand, other investment products and uncertainties around the global economy, as the situation has changed since the interim budget in February.""After accounting for redemptions, the net issuances of sovereign gold bonds are now estimated at Rs 15,000 crore for this fiscal year, a significant decrease from the Rs 26,138 crore projected in the interim budget and Rs 25,352 crore in the revised estimate for 2023-24.Harish Galipelli, director at ILA Commodities India, attributed this shift to retail investors increasingly opting for equities in anticipation of better returns. He also noted that people are uncertain about the potential for further increases in gold prices in the short-to-medium term following a recent rally. Additionally, Galipelli pointed out that savings in rural areas have been impacted by retail inflation and other factors.The gold bond and gold monetisation schemes were introduced by the government in late 2015 to discourage the physical purchase of precious metals and reduce imports, thereby mitigating the negative impact on the current account deficit.The gross collection through these two schemes is now projected to be Rs 20,030 crore in 2024-25, compared to Rs 31,168 crore in the interim budget and Rs 28,240 crore (revised estimate) in the previous fiscal year. Similarly, the net collection is estimated at Rs 16,433 crore, down from Rs 27,571 crore in the interim budget and Rs 26,653 crore in the previous year. However, the estimates for the gold monetisation scheme remain unchanged from the interim budget level.Also Read | Budget 2024: Duty cuts on gold, silver, platinum, and diamonds to make jewellery more affordable The sovereign gold bond scheme targets investors who view gold as an investment, encouraging them to purchase paper gold instead of physical gold.On the other hand, the gold monetisation scheme aims to bring out idle gold held by households, temple trusts, and others to increase domestic supply. Both schemes were designed to curb gold imports, which, along with crude oil, have been significant contributors to India's current account deficit.

It was a key topic of discussion at the 8th Bima Manthan held here. The meeting brought together top Irdai officials and leaders from across the insurance industry for a two-day summit focused on preparing the sector for the future.With an eye on global standards, discussions centred on risk management, new financial reporting rules, and the implementation of a risk-based supervisory framework (RBSF). RBSF employed by several countries worldwide, allows regulators to focus their attention on the insurers posing the greatest risk to the system, rather than applying a one-size-fits-all approach. By assessing factors like financial stability, governance, and compliance history, regulators can tailor their oversight and intervene early where necessary.Both regulators and insurance companies shared insights gleaned from pilot studies and impact assessments, paving the way for a smoother transition to the RBSF. The meeting also highlighted the progress of Bima Sugam, a digital platform designed to simplify the insurance experience for consumers. This initiative, along with a renewed focus on cybersecurity in the face of evolving digital threats, underscores the industry's commitment to modernisation and consumer protection.Expanding insurance penetration and exploring new avenues for capital augmentation, such as encouraging insurance companies to go public, were also key themes.

Ant Group's profit surge 193% in post-crackdown recovery,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/ant-groups-profit-surge-193-in-post-crackdown-recovery/articleshow/115340384.cms,"Ant Group's profit in June quarter surged 193%, marking a turnaround from its previous year's decline following governmental restrictions. It reached approximately 7.5 billion as calculated by Bloomberg, based on Alibaba's one-third ownership.Earlier, the company witnessed a 10% decline in the previous quarter. The Hangzhou-based fintech company contributed 2.48 billion yuan ($343 million) to Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. 's profits.In March, Ant implemented substantial restructuring, establishing separate boards for its international, database and digital technology divisions to facilitate potential future separations. The organisation has increased its international presence to counterbalance domestic market slowdown.These changes followed billionaire Jack Ma's relinquishment of Ant's control last year. Chinese authorities concluded their internet sector regulation by imposing fines exceeding $1 billion on both Ant and Tencent Holdings Ltd. in July last year.For international expansion, Ant secured $6.5 billion in loans to replace an existing offshore credit facility, according to sources familiar with the matter in September.Ant's global operations developed its blockchain-powered treasury management system, Whale. Additionally, it collaborated with Singapore's DBS Group Holdings Ltd. on a treasury token initiative to enhance inter-account fund transfers.The organisation advanced in artificial intelligence, launching services including ""Zhixiaobao"", a lifestyle assistance application integrating meal ordering, taxi services and other functionalities within Alipay.In China, Ant is evaluating the sale of its Baihang Credit Co. stake whilst awaiting approval for a licence regarding Qiantang, as reported by Bloomberg in June.The company initiated a share buyback of up to 7.6% last year, allowing investors like Fidelity Investments and T. Rowe Price Group Inc. to reduce their holdings.

The organisation awaits a financial holding company licence to potentially resume IPO plans.Originally serving Chinese international travellers, the company developed Alipay+ as a cross-border payment infrastructure supporting various digital wallets. This network now serves 90 million merchants across 66 markets.Alibaba, its affiliated company, reported revenue of 236.5 billion yuan for the quarter ending in September.","Ant Group's profit in June quarter surged 193%, marking a turnaround from its previous year's decline following governmental restrictions.

Japan's growth hit by 'megaquake' warnings amid PM Ishiba's efforts to revitalise economy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/japans-growth-hit-by-megaquake-warnings-amid-pm-ishibas-efforts-to-revitalise-economy/articleshow/115329268.cms,"Holograms, which show different images and colours depending on the angle at which they are viewed, are seen on the new Japanese 10,000 yen banknote.

Japan's economic growth decelerated in the third quarter following earthquake warnings that affected activities, as indicated by official data released on Friday, whilst Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba tries to revitalise the fourth-largest economy.The GDP increased by merely 0.2 per cent from July to September compared to the previous quarter, according to preliminary government figures. This slowdown was attributed to a ""megaquake"" alert in August and one of the most severe typhoons in recent decades.The figures aligned with market predictions but showed a decline from the revised 0.5 per cent growth in the preceding quarter.The annualised GDP growth stood at 0.9 per cent, considerably lower than the revised 2.2 per cent increase observed in April-June.Japan's chief cabinet secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi said on Friday that the government expects a ""gradual recovery"" of the economy, which has faced stagnation and deflation for decades.""Our country is at an important crossroads as it's about to transition into a growth-based economy driven by wage hikes and investment,"" he said, adding, ""To realise that, we will implement all possible economic and fiscal policies, including a package currently under consideration.""Despite leading the ruling coalition to its poorest general election performance in 15 years last month, Ishiba retained his position through a parliamentary vote earlier this week.The 67-year-old leader has announced government support plans for AI and semiconductor sectors, pledging over 10 trillion yen ($64 billion) by 2030.He aims to secure opposition party support this month for a draft supplementary budget containing new stimulus measures, reportedly including financial assistance for low-income households and families.Increased automotive spending, following production resumption after a domestic testing controversy, contributed to output growth during the quarter, news agency AFP reported.However, these gains were offset by Typhoon Shanshan and the ""megaquake"" alert, issued and subsequently withdrawn by the weather agency in August under a new warning system.This resulted in consumers stockpiling emergency provisions, causing rice shortages in supermarkets and numerous hotel cancellations during a major Japanese holiday period.Typhoon Shanshan's impact in the same month disrupted factory production and led to train and flight cancellations.","The GDP increased by merely 0.2 per cent from July to September compared to the previous quarter, according to preliminary government figures.

Eco integration with US growing despite prez changes: Government,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/eco-integration-with-us-growing-despite-prez-changes-government/articleshow/115310920.cms,"AP photo

NEW DELHI: Government on Thursday said trade with the US has sustained despite the change of presidency and argued that the trade deficit is not significant if goods and services are factored in.Between 2001 and 2023, India’s goods exports to the US rose at 10.5% CAGR ( Compounded Annual Growth Rate ), while imports went up 4.8%.“Our (India-US) integration is growing and we are getting bipartisan support. Whatever is the regime (in the US), we are finding that our economic integration with the US is increasing over the period of time... and that is a good thing for us and I trust that it will continue (to grow),” commerce secretary Sunil Barthwal told reporters days after Donald Trump won the US presidential elections.Trump is widely seen to be restricting imports, especially from China, and has also flagged his concerns over high import duty in India. During his first term in White House, he had imposed high tariffs on Indian steel and aluminium, and also withdrew the preferential trade scheme, prompting New Delhi to raise duties on almond and pistachios. Barthwal said the data is showing not only the resiliency but also better integration with the US value chains and “this is a very positive factor which is across all presidencies”.The US was the largest trading partner of India in 2023-24. India’s exports to the US stood at $77.5 billion, while imports aggregated at $42.2 billion in the last fiscal. Additional secretary in the department of commerce Rajesh Agrawal said that in the services area also, India’s exports and imports have registered healthy growth with the US.","Between 2001 and 2023, India’s goods exports to the US rose at 10.5% CAGR ( Compounded Annual Growth Rate ), while imports went up 4.8%. “Our (India-US) integration is growing and we are getting bipartisan support,” commerce secretary Sunil Barthwal told reporters days after Donald Trump won the US presidential elections.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115311027,imgsize-152544,width-400,resizemode-4/115311027.jpg"

The Onion, a satirical publication, acquired Infowars, the website founded by conspiracy theorist Alex Jones , in a bankruptcy auction on Thursday. The Onion 's bid was supported by families of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting victims.In 2022, the families won a $1.4 billion defamation lawsuit against Jones and his company, Free Speech Systems, for spreading false claims about the shooting. The lawsuit forced Jones to declare bankruptcy, leading to Infowars and other company assets being auctioned to compensate creditors, including the Sandy Hook families. Ben Collins , CEO of The Onion's parent company, Global Tetrahedron, confirmed the successful bid. The purchase price was not disclosed.“We thought this would be a hilarious joke,” Collins said, as quoted by The New York Times. “This is going to be our answer to this no-guardrails world where there are no gatekeepers, and everything’s kind of insane.”The Onion plans to relaunch Infowars in January 2024 as a parody of itself, focusing on satirizing misinformation and online personalities like Jones. The revamped site will feature a redesigned format and sponsored content from Everytown for Gun Safety, a non-profit organization dedicated to ending gun violence.Chris Mattei, a lawyer for the Sandy Hook families, said that taking possession of Infowars signifies accountability for ""Alex Jones and his corrupt business.""","The Onion, a satirical publication, acquired Infowars, the website founded by conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, in a bankruptcy auction on Thursday.

Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agents on Wednesday morning searched the Manhattan, New York City, US, apartment of Shayne Coplan , founder and CEO of the prediction market platform Polymarket . The search was part of a criminal investigation by the FBI and the US attorney's office for the southern district of New York, according to a New York Times report.FBI agents arrived at Coplan's SoHo apartment at 6 am and seized several electronic devices, including his phone.The investigation focuses on whether Coplan, 26, operated Polymarket as an unlicensed commodities exchange. This allegedly allowed US users to place bets, potentially violating a prior settlement with the US government.Polymarket accurately predicted Donald Trump 's victory in the 2024 presidential election , forecasting a 58.6% chance of a Trump win on the morning of Election Day.A law enforcement official confirmed to The New York Times that FBI agents conducted ""court-authorized law enforcement activity"" at Coplan's residence early Wednesday.“Polymarket is a fully transparent prediction market that helps everyday people better understand the events that matter most to them, including elections,” a Polymarket spokesperson told the New York Post. “We charge no fees, take no trading positions, and allow observers worldwide to analyze all market data as a public good,” the spokesperson added.Coplan has not been arrested or charged.A source close to the matter speculated to the New York Post that the search might be politically motivated. ""This is obvious political retribution by the outgoing administration against Polymarket for providing a market that correctly called the 2024 presidential election,"" the source claimed.Following the search, Coplan posted on social media platform X, saying, ""New phone, who dis?""In another post on X, Coplan accused the Biden administration of a politically motivated attack, writing:""It’s discouraging that the current administration would make a last-ditch effort to go after companies they deem associated with political opponents. We are deeply committed to being non-partisan, and today is no different. However, the incumbents should reflect and recognize that adopting a more pro-business, pro-startup approach might have altered their fate this election.""In 2022, Polymarket agreed to halt services for US-based users after settling with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) for operating without proper registration. The company paid a $1.4 million fine.",Shayne Coplan is the founder and CEO of prediction market platform Polymarket.

EU fines Meta nearly €800 million for 'abusive' practices benefiting Facebook marketplace,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/eu-fines-meta-nearly-800-million-for-abusive-practices-benefiting-facebook-marketplace/articleshow/115302838.cms,"What the

European Commission claimed

What the company said

The European Commission on Thursday fined Meta nearly €800 million for breaching antitrust rules by giving Facebook users automatic access to Facebook Marketplace , benefiting the platform through ""abusive practices"".The €797.72 million ($840.24 million) penalty follows a prolonged investigation, which concluded that Meta had abused its dominant market position and engaged in anti-competitive conduct.""The European Commission has fined Meta ... for breaching EU antitrust rules by tying its online classified ads service Facebook Marketplace to its personal social network Facebook and by imposing unfair trading conditions on other online classified ads service providers,"" the European Commission said.The European Commission accused the American technology company of misusing its market dominance by enforcing unfavourable business conditions on competing online classified advertisement services advertising on its platforms.Facebook introduced Marketplace in 2016, expanding across various European nations the following year. The EU's ruling contends that Meta unlawfully forces Facebook Marketplace upon Facebook users. However, Meta disputes this, stating that users have the choice to engage with Marketplace, with many choosing not to.According to the commission, Facebook Marketplace gained an unfair ""substantial distribution advantage"" over competitors due to its integration with Facebook.""All Facebook users automatically have access and get regularly exposed to Facebook Marketplace whether they want it or not,"" it said.The commission also said that Meta established unfair conditions for competing classified ads services advertising on Facebook and Instagram.This enabled Meta to ""use ads-related data generated by other advertisers for the sole benefit of Facebook Marketplace"", it said.Meta has indicated its intention to appeal while simultaneously working on implementing a prompt solution that addresses the concerns raised. It contested the ruling, stating it disregarded ""the realities of the thriving European market for online classified listing services"".""Facebook users can choose whether or not to engage with Marketplace, and many don't. The reality is that people use Facebook Marketplace because they want to, not because they have to,"" the company stated.Meta highlighted that whilst the Commission suggested Marketplace could potentially obstruct the growth of established online marketplaces in the EU, they failed to present evidence of actual competitor harm.Meta denied using advertisers' data for such purposes, stating they have implemented systems and controls to prevent this.""It is disappointing that the Commission has chosen to take regulatory action against a free and innovative service built to meet consumer demand,"" the company added.This European Commission action follows its allegations from two years ago regarding Facebook Marketplace receiving undue advantages through its integration with Facebook's main service.The European Union initiated formal investigations into Facebook's potentially anti-competitive behaviour in June 2021, followed by concerns in December 2022 about Meta connecting its dominant social network to its classified advertising services.Meta reported approximately $135 billion (125 billion euros) in total revenue for the previous year.","The European Commission has fined Meta nearly €800 million for breaching antitrust rules.

If you're seeking coloured contacts that complement your warm autumn tones, you’re in the right place! Warm autumn colours are all about deep earth tones, creating a cosy, elegant look.We’ll guide you through selecting brown and grey lenses that suit your unique style, ensuring you achieve a harmonious look with your personal colour palette.A personal colour refers to a palette of colours that complement an individual's natural skin tone, hair colour, and eye colour. These colours are generally categorised into two main types: ""yellow base"" and ""blue base.""Warm Autumn, or yellow-based autumn, is characterised by a strong affinity for deep earth tones, making these shades particularly flattering for individuals with warm, yellowish undertones.Warm Autumn individuals often have deep, rich eye colours, such as dark brown or black. When choosing coloured contacts, it's important to select warm hues that blend well with their natural eye colour. Conversely, cool tones like blue or pastel shades tend to clash with their skin tone and may make their complexion appear dull.Warm Autumn individuals are known for their warm, calming presence and chic elegance. Here are some tips for selecting brown-colored contacts that accentuate these qualities.Rich, yellow-toned shadesWarm autumn features a yellow undertone in their skin, so it’s essential to choose colored contacts that are deep and warm, rather than cool-toned or blue shades.Contacts with bold edges can make the eyes appear more defined and prominent, while those with a blurred edge create a soft, gentle look. Choose a lens based on the vibe you want to achieve.Coloured contacts with a shiny or luminous finish can make your eyes look vibrant and add a touch of glamour to your overall look.Brown: The steady-seller brown is a versatile colour that is easy to match with any makeup look for warm autumn. Choosing a deep brown will give you a more mature and sophisticated impression.Gold: Gold combines both glamour and elegance, and brightens the skin tone of the autumn season.Khaki: This colour gives off a mysterious and cool impression.Terracotta: The terracotta colour brings out the red colour unique to you and creates a sophisticated look with a sense of being lost.For many warm autumn individuals, grey coloured contacts might seem challenging to choose. However, by focusing on a few key points, you can achieve a refined and attractive eye look with grey tones.It’s important to select grey contacts that have yellow undertones, as these will harmonise better with your skin tone. Avoid blue-toned greys, as they can make your complexion appear dull.Instead of opting for solid grey contacts, consider designs that incorporate warm colours like brown or beige. This combination will create a more complementary look for warm autumn individuals.Choosing contacts with a defined border can help emphasise the eyes and create a clean, polished appearance. On the other hand, blurred-edge designs can provide a softer, gentler look.Hazel: A mix of yellow-brown and grey, it is a colour that is naturally familiar to the eyes of autumn leafAsh brown: A mix of ash grey and brown, completes a sophisticated look with a sense of loss.Mocha grey: A mix of mocha brown and grey, gives a sophisticated, adult impression.Brown coloured contacts complement warm autumn skin and eye tones beautifully. Since these contacts aren’t overly bold, they allow for versatile makeup styles. To enhance the charm of warm autumn, it's essential to coordinate your look with warm colour tones.For example, applying bright shades like gold or bronze to your eye shadow can enhance the beauty and impact of your eyes. Similarly, choosing warm beige or orange, brown for your lips will harmonise with your skin tone, resulting in a more natural and attractive appearance.When wearing a grey-based lens we recommend using slightly smoky and calm tones such as pink, beige, and greige. It matches the wonderful atmosphere of grey-based colour tones while leaving behind the warmth of autumn.Warm autumn eyes typically feature yellow and red undertones. Opting for brown coloured contacts will allow the colour to seamlessly blend with your natural eye shade, resulting in a soft and harmonious appearance. To achieve an even more blended look, consider using contacts with a ""no border"" design that merges effortlessly with your eyes, or a ""dot pattern"" that adds depth and creates a naturally larger effect.When choosing a colour cone, the key point is to check the ""DIA (lens diameter)"" or ""tinted diameter."" A tinted diameter of 13.1 mm or less will give the impression that is almost the same as the naked eye, while around 13.3 mm will naturally make your eye pupils look larger.For the most up-to-date information about beauty trends and popular contact lens colour, you may want to consult recent markets.

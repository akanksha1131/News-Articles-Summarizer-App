Tesla earnings plunge! Elon Musk warns of 'rough quarters'; EV giant faces big challenges,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/tesla-reports-sharp-decline-in-q2-earnings-revenue-drops-12-as-elon-musk-led-ev-giant-faces-rough-quarters-heres-all-you-need-to-know/articleshow/122871944.cms,"Tesla's second consecutive decline

Tesla shares fell nearly 5%

Elon Musk

struck an optimistic tone

'It’s just a Model Y': Elon Musk

Tesla reported weaker-than-expected results for the April–June quarter, posting its biggest revenue drop in over a decade and a notable decline in profits.The Elon Musk-led electric vehicle (EV) giant is facing headwinds from reduced government support and softening demand, even as it pushes ahead with ambitious plans for autonomous driving and new vehicle models.For the second quarter, Tesla's total revenue fell 12% to $22.5 billion, down from $25.5 billion in the same period last year, missing analyst expectations compiled by LSEG.Automotive revenue, which makes up the bulk of Tesla's business, declined by 16% year-on-year to $16.7 billion.Adjusted net income also dropped 23% to $1.4 billion, or 40 cents per share, falling short of Wall Street forecasts.This marks Tesla’s second consecutive quarter of declining revenue, Reuters reported. The results come despite the launch of a refreshed version of its popular Model Y SUV, which had been expected to boost sales.In fact, global deliveries for the quarter dropped 13.5%.A major blow came from a sharp 51% drop in revenue from automotive regulatory credits. These credits, which other automakers buy from Tesla to meet emissions rules, have historically supported Tesla’s profitability.The fall in credit sales further dented both revenue and earnings this quarter.Shares of Tesla fell nearly 5% after the earnings announcement, as CEO Musk acknowledged that the company might face ""a few rough quarters"" ahead.""We probably could have a few rough quarters,"" Musk said, when questioned on the credits.""I'm not saying we will, but we could - you know, Q4, Q1, maybe Q2, but once you get to autonomy at scale in the second half of next year, certainly by the end of next year, I think I'd be surprised if Tesla's economics are not very compelling,"" he added.He attributed the short-term challenges to the reduction of EV tax credits in the US, a key incentive that is set to shrink by $7,500 later this year.Despite the tough quarter, Musk struck an optimistic tone about Tesla’s future. Musk pointed to the company’s autonomous driving technology as a key growth driver, predicting that revenue from self-driving software and services could start ramping up in the second half of 2025.Tesla is investing heavily in developing a robotaxi fleet, including a custom-built autonomous vehicle known as the ""Cybercab,"" which is expected to go into volume production in 2026.A small trial of robotaxis using Model Y SUVs has already begun in Austin, Texas.Musk said Tesla is seeking regulatory approval for its Full Self-Driving (FSD) software in several US states, as well as in the Netherlands, and aims to launch autonomous ride-hailing services across half the US by year-end.The company is also working on a new, more affordable model — a stripped-down version of the Model Y, to target a wider customer base.However, Chief Financial Officer Vaibhav Taneja told Reuters that the production of the lower-cost model would ramp up more slowly than originally planned, starting next quarter.Musk, when asked about the vehicle’s design, jokingly said, ""It’s just a Model Y,"" adding to ""let the cat out of the bag there.""Analysts say Tesla’s focus on a cheaper EV could be key to regaining sales momentum, especially as the company faces increasing competition from lower-priced Chinese EV makers and consumer backlash against Musk’s controversial political stances.Tesla’s lineup is also beginning to show its age, despite the recent refresh of the Model Y.The company reiterated its production plans for the Cyber cab and its long-delayed Semi truck, both scheduled for volume output in 2026.While Tesla's near-term financials appear shaky, much of its trillion-dollar valuation still hinges on its autonomous vehicle and robotics ambitions.","Tesla reported its biggest revenue drop in over a decade and a notable decline in profits.

Gold and silver price prediction today: Gold prices may test the Rs 101,700 levels in the near future on the back of overall bullish sentiments, say analysts. Silver prices too suggest that the upward trend will likely continue.Gold prices on the Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX) have surged past the ₹100,000 mark, signaling strong bullish momentum. This rally is being supported by global cues, particularly the breakout in COMEX Gold, which has breached the crucial resistance level of $3430 per ounce. This breakout indicates further upside potential in both international and domestic markets.The bullish sentiment is expected to push MCX Gold prices towards ₹101,500 in the short term, with the possibility of testing ₹101,700 levels in the coming week. Strong buying interest, supported by global economic uncertainty, central bank purchases, and inflationary concerns, continues to provide a firm base for gold prices.Traders and investors should remain cautious of short-term corrections but can maintain a bullish bias as long as prices hold above the support level of ₹99,400. A stop-loss near this level is advised to manage risk effectively. Overall, the trend remains upward, and any dip towards ₹100,000 could be seen as a buying opportunity.With positive momentum building, and strong global cues, MCX Gold may continue its northward journey in the near term, attracting more buyers and potentially setting new record highs in the process.MCX Silver prices have climbed to the ₹116,000 mark, indicating strong bullish momentum in the precious metals space. The rally is supported by both domestic demand and positive cues from international markets, where silver continues to gain strength amid rising industrial demand and ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties.The current price action suggests that the upward trend is still intact, and there appears to be more room for the rally to extend further. Technically, silver has maintained higher highs and higher lows, which is a classic sign of a bullish continuation pattern. If the momentum sustains, MCX Silver is likely to test ₹118,000 levels in the near term, with a potential to stretch further towards ₹120,000.On the downside, immediate support is seen near ₹114,000, which is expected to act as a cushion against any short-term corrections. As long as prices stay above this level, the bullish trend is likely to continue. Traders can look for buying opportunities on minor dips, keeping a stop-loss below ₹114,000 to manage risks effectively.With strong fundamentals and favorable technical structure, silver remains poised for further gains. Market participants should stay alert to key price levels and global developments that may influence the precious metals space.","Gold prices on the Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX) have surged past the ₹100,000 mark, signaling strong bullish momentum.

IEX share price today: The Indian Energy Exchange (IEX) shares dropped 15% to their lower circuit at Rs 159.7 on BSE on Thursday following the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission's (CERC) official approval to implement market coupling in India's power sector.The regulatory announcement came shortly before IEX's scheduled first-quarter results for FY26, causing increased concern amongst investors regarding the company's immediate future.A late Wednesday order from CERC indicated the introduction of market coupling would occur in stages, with the Day-Ahead Market (DAM) implementation set for January 2026. This decision follows thorough discussions with Grid-India and various power sector participants.The objective of market coupling is to standardise price discovery by consolidating bids from different power exchanges for centralised clearing. Whilst this system aims to enhance operational efficiency and minimise regional price variations, it could affect the revenue structure of established organisations like IEX, according to an ET report.IEX presently functions as a standalone entity with significant presence in the DAM and Real-Time Market (RTM).The new coupling system will require centralised matching of bids from IEX and other exchanges, which could reduce IEX's current market advantages.Bernstein reduced its price target for IEX to Rs 122 from Rs 160, whilst keeping a 'Market-Perform' rating. The firm stated, ""Coupling… as bad as it gets,"" highlighting concerns about IEX's transaction fees and market position. ""With the moat of liquidity gone, the only way to compete is transaction charge,"" they concluded.In contrast, UBS retained its 'Buy' recommendation with a Rs 285 target. Despite acknowledging the negative development, they referenced the Grid-India report showing minimal benefits of 0.01-0.3% in savings or cleared volume. They also indicated that RTM coupling would be considered subsequently. During FY25, DAM and RTM collectively generated approximately 80% of IEX's income.Axis Capital discussed potential earnings impact, calculating that IEX's EPS might have been roughly 30% lower in FY25 had market coupling been operational, due to reduced market share.The focus of market participants will be on the management's views regarding market coupling implications, volume projections, and IEX's strategy leading up to the January 2026 implementation.","The Indian Energy Exchange (IEX) shares dropped 15% to their lower circuit at Rs 159.7 on BSE on Thursday following the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission's (CERC) official approval to implement market coupling in India's power sector.

Top stock market recommendations: According to Aakash K Hindocha, Deputy Vice President - WM Research, Nuvama Professional Clients Group, Balkrishna Industries, Sona BLW Precision Forgings, and Hindalco are the top buy calls for today. Here’s his view on Nifty , Bank Nifty and the top stock picks for July 24, 2025:Nifty has entered a consolidation zone once again, though broader trend indicates upside from current levels, but absence of tailwinds are keeping the index in range. We continue with our view on a broad consolidation between 24800 and 25320 for the balance of this week, given the chart structure and positioning based on derivative data. Given the tailwind from Nifty IT, this could allow positive rub off on the index as well allowing it to breakout above 25320 for a sustained up move.After reclaiming its resistance of 56750 in Monday’s session, the index has furthered its ongoing breakout above 57100 to allow momentum on the long side on Bank Nifty. Outperformance against Nifty which has been powering the underlying current on this index, is set to continue.On the flip side, closing below 56700 could allow downward pressure on the index. Targets are open for new all time highs on the index.Balkrishna Industries stock has given a cup and handle breakout on daily chart at the start of this week. This pattern has been in place from the start of this calendar year marking an end of its 6 month consolidation. Given the set up this suggests a 10-12% upside from current levels.After hitting a 3.5 year low at the start of this fiscal, Sona BLW Precision Forgings has found buyers to scale it up towards the 540-550 odd zone. Rally and retests have allowed a bullish pole and flag pattern breakout on charts. Adding to this a 2 month old sloping trendline breakout has also been confirmed in Wednesday’s closing.All of this allows for the ongoing rally to continue to a retest of its 200 DMA resistance at 545+.HINDALCO has given a 9 month trendline breakout same time last month, but the stock had been missing follow through, a retest and back to the breakout price has made way for a follow through to play out. Stock has also sustained above its 200 DMA for four consecutive weeks now, enabling for further upside on charts.","Top stock market recommendations: According to Aakash K Hindocha, Balkrishna Industries, Sona BLW Precision Forgings, and Hindalco are the top buy calls for today.

India Eyes ‘Special Treatment’ From US

What Trump Has Said



India-US trade deal negotiations are making ‘fantastic’ progress according to Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal . His statement comes days ahead of US President Donald Trump ’s reciprocal tariff deadline of August 1. Both India and the US are looking to seal a mini or interim trade deal ahead of that.Goyal has also expressed optimism about getting preferential treatment for India from the Trump administration, according to a Reuters report.In the last few days Trump has announced several trade deals with countries like Japan, Vietnam, Indonesia and Philippines. Earlier this month the US President sent out tariff letters to over 20 countries informing them of tariff rates effective August 1. Since then some of these countries have struck a trade deal with America. Notably, India has not received any letter so far.During his United Kingdom visit for the signing of the India-UK trade deal, Goyal downplayed the significance of deadlines in trade negotiations whilst expressing optimism about the discussions with the United States.""We're making fantastic progress with the United States, and I do hope we'll be able to conclude a very consequential partnership,"" Goyal said when asked about the trade deal.Also Read | India-US trade deal: India wants Donald Trump administration to offer tariff rate lower than Indonesia; eyes competitive advantage India has hardened its stance on opening its agriculture and dairy sector - a consistent stand in all its trade deals so far. The US is pushing for access into these two sectors.When questioned about potential disagreements with Washington regarding agriculture, Goyal responded that ""negotiations happen in the negotiation room"", whilst indicating that India would consider accepting smaller sectoral achievements rather than insisting on a comprehensive agreement.Importantly, Goyal said that India is looking for preferential market access into the US compared to its competitors.""All options are on the table, and we will see how it plays out, but what is important is to get preferential market access over our competitors, our peers,"" he was quoted as saying by Reuters.Also Read | ‘10% is the new zero tariff’: Trump seals trade deals with many countries - what do they mean for India? ""And I'm very confident that India, having been the first country to start negotiating, will be given a special and preferred treatment,” he added.Earlier this week Reuters reported government sources as saying that an interim trade deal with the US ahead of the August 1 deadline for 26% reciprocal tariffs looks unlikely.Goyal expressed his view that negotiations have never been successful when constrained by timelines or predetermined restrictions. He emphasised his desire for an agreement that benefits all parties involved.""One has to have a broad mind and a package which is balanced and can give equity to both sides.""In the last few weeks, the US President has repeatedly indicated that a trade deal with India is ‘near’. Indian officials were in the US last week for the fifth round of talks for the bilateral trade agreement. According to a PTI report, US officials are likely to visit India in the second half of August for another round of trade talks.While both countries are targeting the first phase of the trade deal by fall, expectations have been there for an interim agreement being announced.While announcing a trade deal with Indonesia, Trump had indicated that the trade deal with India is being worked on similar lines in terms of market access. He has time and again asked major world economies to open their markets for US products, indicating flexibility in bringing down tariff rates.Also Read | Donald Trump’s aggressive trade moves: US President indicates he won’t go below 15% tariff rate; ‘we’ll have a straight…’ Meanwhile, Trump has also suggested that a 15% reciprocal tariff would serve as the standard baseline for the majority of nations.

Trading activity is expected to remain focused on individual stocks as more companies release their quarterly performance figures.VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Investments Limited says, “The India-UK FTA, which is India’s first comprehensive trade agreement with a major developed country, has two implications from the market perspective. One, this FTA will significantly boost trade between both countries, which will be seen as a positive by the market. Two, this FTA along with many other FTAs signed by India with other countries, projects India as a nation committed to free trade. The fact that this FTA has come during a time of tariff wars is commendable, and hopefully this will improve India’s chances of striking a fair-trade deal with the US. Sectors like textiles, leather, food processing, automobiles, pharmaceuticals and gems and jewellery, which are expected to benefit from the FTA, will be on the market radar.”“The near-term market construct has turned weak.

Gold price prediction today: Gold rates will be under pressure with a bearish outlook for the near term, say analysts.Gold futures on MCX (Contract: 05AUG2025) continue to trade under pressure after a short-lived recovery, with technical indicators signaling that upside potential remains capped.The price is currently hovering around ₹98,749 after a sharp two-day decline, with short-term moving averages indicating a bearish structure. As a result, today's outlook favors a Sell on Rise strategy in the ₹99,000 zone, with a stop-loss at ₹99,450.The 8-period EMA stands at ₹98,735, while the 21-period EMA is at ₹98,700. Prices are currently sandwiched between these averages, but the broader trend shows a sustained failure to break above either decisively. This crossover pattern reinforces a weak recovery structure and favors short positions at resistance zones.The price has been rejecting the middle band and is unable to approach the upper band convincingly. This behavior typically reflects low buying strength and enhances the probability of price rolling over near higher levels.The immediate pivot-based resistances lie between ₹98,950 and ₹99,200.A supply zone around ₹99,000 has been tested but not convincingly breached, confirming it as a sell-trigger level for intraday traders.RSI is currently at 51.98, having rebounded from sub-30 levels but struggling to sustain above 60. This mid-zone reading indicates a lack of bullish momentum and supports the view of limited upside.Although a minor crossover may have occurred during the bounce, the MACD histogram likely remains flat or mildly positive. There is no strong bullish divergence to suggest a trend reversal, implying rallies may remain corrective.Price continues to follow a lower-high lower-low structure on the intraday chart. The recent bounce appears more like a technical pullback rather than a change in trend. Selling near key resistance levels offers a favorable risk-reward setup.The short-term outlook for gold remains cautious, with bearish signals intact across major indicators. Intraday traders may look to Sell on Rise near ₹99,000, keeping a stop-loss at ₹99,450 and aiming for potential downside targets of ₹98,400 and ₹98,150. Weak momentum, resistance-heavy zones, and failed recovery above moving averages all point to the likelihood of further downside.","Gold futures on MCX (Contract: 05AUG2025) continue to trade under pressure after a short-lived recovery, with technical indicators signaling that upside potential remains capped.

Stock market recommendations:Benchmark indices remained rangebound, reflecting investor indecision amid heightened macro headwinds from ongoing India-US trade talks and the onset of the Q1 FY26 earnings season. Broader market activity was largely stock-specific, as participants adopted a cautious stance in anticipation of clearer fundamental cues and earnings visibility. Notably, India VIX slipped to 10—its lowest level in five months—signaling a lull in volatility and a market in wait-and-watch mode.Structurally, the index continues to exhibit strength through its formation of higher highs and higher lows, underscoring resilience despite geopolitical and policy-related uncertainties. On the near-term charts, the index breached its 20-day EMA, currently around 25,250—a level that previously acted as support and now serves as immediate resistance. A sustained move above 25,250 could open the door for further upside towards the 25,500 mark.On the downside, Nifty finds a robust support zone in the 24,900–25,100 range, backed by multiple technical confluences:(a) the rising 50-day EMA,(b) an ascending trendline connecting the May and June 2025 lows,(c) the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement of the prior rally from 24,473 to 25,669, and(d) the upper band of the recent breakout zone near the 25,000 level.Overall, the market remains in a consolidation phase with a cautiously optimistic undertone as the earnings season unfolds.Bank Nifty remained confined within a narrow consolidation zone last week, mirroring cautious investor sentiment amid ongoing India-US trade uncertainties and the impending Q1 FY26 earnings season for banking stocks.The index continues to hover above its 20-day EMA—a dynamic support level it has respected since April—underscoring the strength of the prevailing bullish undertone. This, coupled with improving market breadth, affirms the formation of a higher high–higher low structure, indicating a well-established uptrend.Over the past 10 sessions, the index has been consolidating within the 56,000–57,600 range, and we expect this sideways movement to persist. A breakout beyond either side of this band will be crucial to determine the next directional bias. On the downside, immediate support is placed at 55,940—aligning with the 50-day EMA—while stronger support lies at 55,500, a key demand zone that has consistently cushioned declines in recent weeks.The Gujarat Pipavav Port Ltd stock is forming a consistent pattern of higher highs and higher lows on the daily chart, signaling a sustained uptrend.Additionally, it continues to trade above its key moving averages, reinforcing the positive momentum.On the indicator front, the rising ADX, coupled with a strengthening +DMI, indicates that the ongoing trend is gaining momentum and is likely to strengthen further.The counter is on the verge of breaking out of its two-month consolidation range, supported by strong volumes, indicating a potential confirmation of the breakout.The stock has broken out of its consolidation phase on the daily timeframe, consistently forming a higher high–higher low structure over the past four months—signalling a sustained uptrend.It continues to trade well above its key moving averages, reinforcing the bullish bias.On the indicator front, a rising ADX along with a strengthening +DMI suggests increasing trend strength, indicating that momentum is likely to accelerate further.","According to Bajaj Broking Research, Gujarat Pipavav Port Ltd (GPPL) and National Aluminum are the top stock picks for today.

Choices widen: More British brands in mix,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/choices-widen-more-british-brands-in-mix/articleshow/122892247.cms,"MUMBAI: From angrezi make up and beauty creams to chocolates, Indians looking to shop for more foreign brands may soon be spoilt for choice. Following the FTA with UK, more British brands are expected to launch in India while companies already present in the market are likely to expand their business.This is essentially because with reduced tariffs, brands will be able to price their products more affordably, stepping up competition against a slew of global and local brands already selling in India and widen their set of consumers. They will also be willing to bring more of their UK portfolio to India which means more choice for local shoppers.""For UK-based brands, the FTA will bring down the cost of entering India and this will allow them to pass on the benefits to consumers. For us as a platform, it means easier registration and onboarding of British brands,"" Radhika Ghai, founder & CEO at Kindlife, a Gurgaon based online marketplace which launches and distributes global beauty brands told TOI, adding that it is in talks with more than half a dozen UK cosmetic brands looking for India foray. Under the FTA, India's average tariff on UK products will eventually drop from 15% to 3%.With a growing share of nouveau riche and young shoppers who are seeking beyond ordinary labels, India is a market too lucrative for brands to miss and the trade agreement will open up space for a range of value, premium and luxury British brands to tap into India.A clutch of premium and luxury consumer/retail British brands including The Body Shop, Pret A Manger, Burberry, Asos, Next are already selling in India.""Currently, 90% of our portfolio is imported from the UK, and the FTA has the potential to further lower import duties on UK-made beauty products, which will directly benefit customers,"" said Shriti Malhotra, executive chairperson of Quest Retail, The Body Shop. Quest Retail has sales, distribution and marketing rights for The Body Shop in India.In the $20 billion Indian beauty market, imports from UK make up a small fraction of the market currently-about Rs 250-300 crore and the scope for brands to grow is higher, said Rahul Guha, senior director at Crisil.""The existing British retail brands will be the biggest beneficiaries of the deal as they already know the India market. For brands generally, it will become easier to get listed online and ink franchise agreements to enter small towns,"" said Anand Ramanathan, partner and consumer industry leader, Deloitte South Asia.Besides with lower tariffs, British brands can make more marketing investments in India.

Investment Returns Analysis



SGB Interest Payment Structure

Is there flexibility to redeem SGBs before maturity?

What is the process for exiting an SGB investment?

Soverign Gold Bond redemption: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has announced the early redemption value for Sovereign Gold Bonds (SGB) 2018-19 Series-V. Investors can opt for early redemption only after holding the bonds for five years from the issue date.According to RBI, the above mentioned SGB is up for early redemption on Tuesday, July 22, 2025. These gold bonds reach maturity after an 8-year period from their issue date.Sovereign Gold Bonds or SGBs are in essence government-backed securities that are measured in grams of gold. They serve as an alternative to investment in physical gold. Investors need to make cash payments for purchasing these bonds, and upon maturity, they receive cash settlements. The Government of India authorises the Reserve Bank of India to manage the issuance of these bonds.We take a look at the early redemption value, potential returns from choosing premature redemption, and other details as listed in an ET report:For SGBs due for early redemption on July 22, 2025, the redemption value is set at Rs 9,820 per unit. This calculation considers the average closing gold prices over three business days: July 17, 2025, July 18, 2025, and July 21, 2025.""The redemption price of SGB shall be based on the simple average of the closing gold price of 999 purity of the previous three business days from the date of redemption, as published by the India Bullion and Jewellers Association Ltd (IBJA),” says RBI in its July 21, 2025 release.The initial issue price of SGB 2018-19 Series-V in January 2019 was Rs 3214 per gram. The absolute gain amounts to Rs 6,606 (Rs 9,820 - Rs 3214), excluding interest earnings. This represents a substantial return of 205.56% on the investment.For investors Sovereign Gold Bonds mean a fixed annual interest of 2.50% on the principal investment amount. The interest payments are credited twice a year directly to the investor's bank account. The final interest crediting happens at maturity in addition to the principal amount.Whilst the bonds have an 8-year tenure, early redemption is permitted after five years from issuance on specified coupon payment dates. When held in demat format, these bonds can be traded on exchanges. Additionally, they are transferable to other qualified investors.If you want to opt for early redemption, you have to contact your bank/SHCIL offices/Post Office/agent 30 days before to the coupon payment date. Early redemption requests are processed only if they ate submitted at least one day before the coupon payment date. The redemption amount is then transferred to the bank account specified during the bond application.","Sovereign Gold Bonds or SGBs are government-backed securities measured in grams of gold.

What is the TCS Benching Policy ?

TCS Benching Policy Impact

TCS Benching Policy: Industry Impact

Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) employees are worried about layoffs as the first round of the new benching policy at India’s largest IT services giant ends. Several TCS employees appear to be taking to social media platforms like Reddit to express their concerns about their role and future in TCS.The newly implemented benching guidelines effective from June 12 restrict the non-billable period to 35 days annually, beyond which employees could face professional setbacks or possible job loss.According to an ET report, employees have reported various challenges, including urgent project searches, assignments in mismatched skill areas, unsuccessful client interviews, and difficulties securing projects in preferred locations.A concerned Reddit participant was quoted as saying, ""This is the first step towards employment rationalisation based on utilisation. Brace for layoffs.""A new recruit shared, ""I have recently joined TCS and training was conducted in Java. Now, it's not even a month on bench and RMG is pressuring me to join a *** support project, far from Java and Python.""However, the financial daily could not verify the veracity of the posts on Redditt.Explaining the revised bench policy, TCS chief executive and managing director K Krithivasan told Times of India: ""It's always been expected that associates take responsibility for their careers. While HR supports project placement, we also expect associates to proactively seek new assignments after completing existing ones. What you're seeing now is simply a more structured version of what's long been in practice. We aim to minimise bench time.""Also Read | Infosys vs Cognizant fight gets uglier! Why are the two big IT firms battling it out in the US? Explained The company prioritises substantial investment in employee development. ""Once we've made that investment, we work to ensure associates are deployed,"" he said. ""While preferences are considered, projects are driven by client needs, not personal choice. We deploy based on training, demand, and skill alignment. If gaps exist, we work to close them before deployment.""When questioned about TCS withholding salaries for staff on extended bench periods, Krithivasan offered no direct response.The exact impact on the TCS workforce remains uncertain. Based on industry data, approximately 15-18% of employees at major Indian IT companies typically remain on bench. TCS, which leads India's IT sector, currently employs around 613,000 individuals.Last week a workers' rights organisation approached Union labour minister Mansukh Mandaviya, requesting immediate intervention regarding TCS's bench policy, which they described as ""inhumane,"" ""exploitative"" and mentally taxing for technology professionals.Nascent Information Technology Employees Senate (NITES) submitted a formal complaint to the minister, claiming that TCS is pressuring benched employees through termination threats and withholding experience certificates if they cannot secure project assignments within specified timeframes.Also Read | TCS gives out variable pay! Over 70% employees to get 100% variable; no decision yet on salary hikes ""These are not non-performing employees, but skilled professionals who find themselves temporarily without allocation… Instead of support, they are met with suspicion, coercion, and threats,"" NITES president Harpreet Singh Saluja said in the letter.Some staff members are however backing TCS' decision, noting that numerous employees have stayed unassigned for extended periods, turning down offered projects. These individuals have used their unallocated time for pursuing additional qualifications whilst not contributing to the organisation's productivity.""This may help TCS trimming some seriously underperforming resources, those stuck on TCS like a leech,"" a Reddit user posted.The IT sector anticipates significant changes as artificial intelligence (AI) begins to automate routine operations.""We expect IT companies to become stricter with their bench policies due to the soft business environment and AI-led demand for advanced skill sets,"" Pareekh Jain, founder and CEO of EIIRTrend told ET. He observed that staff expenses are notably affecting company profit margins.The stringent bench policy implemented by TCS might influence other IT firms, as managing bench strength becomes increasingly challenging due to AI-driven productivity improvements making it harder to reassign entry-level engineers, according to industry specialists.""Tech companies must continuously align their employees' skill sets with evolving client needs. By revisiting their bench policies, organisations are encouraging employees to reskill and stay relevant in high-demand areas such as AI, cybersecurity, and digital engineering,"" said Nitin Bhatt, technology sector leader at EY India according to the financial daily’s report.""Going forward, tenure and grade-based promotions and merit increases will likely be replaced by assessments of skills proficiency and competencies required to take on new roles,"" he added.Also Read | ‘Character assassination’: Delhi HC asks Wipro to pay Rs 2 lakh for defamation of ex-employee; termination letter full of ‘stigma and insinuations’","Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) employees are worried about layoffs as the first round of the new benching policy at India’s largest IT services giant ends.

Just exhuasted, but it was well worth it. The next step is to close the deal early by Aug 7.”The FCC’s decision, passed by a 2-1 vote, came just weeks after Paramount paid $16 million to settle a lawsuit filed by Donald Trump over a 2020 “60 Minutes” interview with then-vice president Kamala Harris, which the president claimed was deceptively edited to sway the 2024 election. While CBS denied the allegation, it chose to settle to avoid any delays to the merger.Crucial to gaining FCC approval were assurances from Ellison, son of Oracle founder Larry Ellison, and RedBird Capital that the new management would ensure unbiased journalism at CBS. The company has promised to appoint an independent ombudsman to oversee complaints related to editorial fairness and transparency, the New York Post reported.In a move seen as politically charged, Paramount also scrapped its diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives to align with the Trump administration’s stance, which argues such policies amount to discrimination.“Americans no longer trust the legacy national news media to report fully, accurately, and fairly,” said FCC Chair Brendan Carr, a Trump appointee.""It is time for a change. That is why I welcome Skydance’s commitment to make significant changes at the once storied CBS broadcast network.""Dissenting FCC Commissioner Anna Gomez, the sole Democratic vote against the deal, condemned the decision, saying, “After months of cowardly capitulation to this administration, Paramount finally got what it wanted.”As part of the deal, Shari Redstone, the controlling shareholder of Paramount Global, will receive $1.75 billion in cash and step down from the company’s board. Her departure marks the end of the Redstone family’s direct influence over the media empire her father, Sumner Redstone, built.Skydance, known for producing hits like Top Gun: Maverick and Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning, will merge with Paramount to form “Paramount Skydance Corp.” The newly formed company will remain publicly traded but under the control of the Ellison family. David Ellison will serve as chairman and CEO, while former NBCUniversal boss Jeff Shell will become president.The FCC also approved the transfer of 28 CBS-owned TV station licences to the new company. This came shortly after CBS abruptly cancelled The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, citing financial reasons. The programme, despite strong ratings, was reportedly losing $40 million a year.Trump, who originally sued Paramount for $20 billion, claimed this week that the real settlement was closer to $36 million. The new owners committed $20 million to run pro-MAGA public service ads.The merger marks a dramatic turning point for Paramount, which has struggled in recent years with declining revenues and the challenges of streaming-era disruption. Redstone had initially reunited CBS and Viacom in 2019 in a bid to strengthen the company’s competitive footing, but the rapidly changing media landscape proved difficult to navigate.With the deal now approved, all eyes will be on Ellison and Skydance as they take the reins of one of America’s most iconic media brands.","The US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has officially approved the $8.4 billion merger between Paramount Global and Skydance Media.

US-Japan deal brings tariff clarity: 15% cap averts August duties; EU and China face pressure as next deadlines loom,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-japan-deal-brings-tariff-clarity-15-cap-averts-august-duties-eu-and-china-face-pressure-as-next-deadlines-loom/articleshow/122887950.cms,"Markets cheer clarity, automakers lead gains

EU and China next in line

A landmark trade deal between the US and Japan has set a new benchmark for global tariff negotiations, as economists say the 15% cap agreed for auto and goods tariffs could become the new normal in ongoing trade talks with other key US partners.Under the agreement, tariffs on Japanese auto imports to the US will drop from 27.5% to 15%, while levies on other goods that were set to rise to 25% from August 1 will also be cut to 15%, Reuters reported. The deal, which includes investment and lending commitments, is one of the most significant trade pacts signed by US President Donald Trump, who has imposed a series of steep tariffs on dozens of trading partners this yearThe deal relieves markets and raises pressure on other major economies, including the European Union and China, both of which face looming August deadlines to conclude similar agreements or risk the reimposition of punitive tariffs.“Average tariffs for the US were around 2.5% for 2024; currently, they stand around 17%,” said Mohit Kumar of Jefferies, referencing the spike in duties following Trump’s “Liberation Day” trade policy shift in April.“Our base case remains that when the dust settles, we could see average tariffs around 15%, though recent deals suggest that this number could be slightly higher,” Kumar was quoted as saying by Reuters.“While a negative from a macro point of view, the world can live with 15% or so tariffs.”Relieved by the clarity brought by the US-Japan pact, Japan’s Nikkei 225 index rose 3.5%, while European automakers with major US exposure also rallied. Volvo Car surged over 10%, while Porsche, BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen gained between 4% and 7%.“It looks like the benchmark for major economies is going to be 10–15%, and a somewhat higher level for smaller economies,” said Derek Halpenny, head of research at MUFG in London.Deutsche Bank’s Jim Reid noted the move “helped to ease investor fears that tariffs are about to snap back higher on August 1,” but cautioned that significant threats remain. “The threat of much higher tariffs still remains for several large economies, including the 30% on the EU, 35% on Canada and 50% on Brazil,” he said, quoted Reuters.The European Union, which negotiates on behalf of its 27 member states, faces the threat of 30% US tariffs by August 1. While EU negotiators initially aimed for a 10% rate, expectations have now shifted toward a higher outcome.China, too, is on the clock. Without a deal by August 12, tariffs could snap back to 145% on the US side and 125% on the Chinese side—raising the stakes dramatically for both economies.“The US-Japan deal will put more pressure on other major Asia exporters to secure better deals,” ING noted in a research comment. “We’ve already seen trade deals with the Philippines and Indonesia. Before August 1, there should be more deals struck with Asian exporters.”The deal also helped ease longer-term US inflation expectations, suggesting that successful trade pacts could help the Federal Reserve regain room to cut interest rates later this year.",US-Japan trade deal sets new benchmark for global tariff negotiations. 15% cap agreed for auto and goods tariffs could become new normal.

Donald Trump’s Aggressive Trade Strategy

US President Donald Trump seems to have indicated that the 15% reciprocal tariff rate would be the new baseline for most countries.""We'll have a straight, simple tariff of anywhere between 15% and 50%,"" Trump said Wednesday at an AI summit in Washington according to a Bloomberg report.

Neodymium (Nd): Permanent magnets in motors, headphones, microphones, hard drives, speakers

Praseodymium (Pr): Magnets (with Nd), aircraft engines, fibre optic cables

Dysprosium (Dy): Improves heat resistance in magnets, used in EV motors, hard drives, earbuds

Terbium (Tb): Phosphors for green colour in displays and lighting

Samarium (Sm): High-strength magnets for headphones, microwave devices, small motors

Europium (Eu): Red phosphors for displays and LED lights

Yttrium (Y): Phosphors for LED and CRT displays, laser devices

Gadolinium (Gd): Used in data storage and MRI machines

Lanthanum (La): Rechargeable batteries, lenses in cameras/smartphones, glass additives

Cerium (Ce): Polishing compounds for glass, catalysts, and phosphors

Erbium (Er): Optical amplifiers in fibre optic communication

India’s ambitions in electronics, electric vehicles (EVs), and clean energy may face critical challenges due to its limited domestic production of rare earth elements (REEs), despite holding sizable reserves.China continues to dominate the global REE supply chain, controlling over 90 per cent of the world’s processing and magnet-making capacity, reported ET.Rare earths, 17 elements with unique magnetic, luminescent, and electrochemical properties, are essential for a wide range of high-tech and green energy products. From permanent magnets in EV motors and wind turbines to phosphors in LED lights and data storage in MRI machines, these materials are foundational to next-generation technologies.Here’s how individual elements are used:Other REEs, Scandium, Holmium, Thulium, Lutetium, Ytterbium, Promethium, are vital in specialised lasers, sensors, electronic devices, and medical imaging systems.According to ET, China alone accounts for nearly 70 per cent of global rare earth mining, with countries like the US (12 per cent), Myanmar (10 per cent), and Australia (8 per cent) following distantly.India, though possessing around 6–7 million metric tonnes of reserves, about 6–7 per cent of the global total, contributes less than 1 per cent to the world’s annual output.This creates a major vulnerability for Indian manufacturers. Any disruption or restriction in supply from China could severely impact production lines, especially in EVs, smartphones, and defence systems. As per ET, this gives Beijing immense leverage.While the US has tried building its own capacity in light rare earths like neodymium and cerium, China remains the primary source for most critical elements, including dysprosium, terbium, and yttrium.","Rare earths, 17 elements with unique magnetic, luminescent, and electrochemical properties, are essential for a wide range of high-tech and green energy products.

Personal finance author Robert Kiyosaki has once again raised alarm over the state of the global financial system, urging investors to abandon fiat currencies and instead turn to real assets like gold, silver, and Bitcoin.In a fresh social media post on X, the Rich Dad Poor Dad author reiterated his long-standing criticism of central banks, warning that the US economy is on the brink of a historic collapse.“Stop saving FAKE $,” Kiyosaki wrote, advising his followers to “Start saving real gold, silver, Bitcoin.” Referring to his well-known principle, he added: “Rich Dads Rule: ‘Savers are Losers.’”Kiyosaki slammed the US Federal Reserve for repeatedly responding to financial crises by expanding the money supply, calling it a form of “printing fake money.” He listed several examples including the 1987 market crash, the 1998 collapse of Long-Term Capital Management, the 2019 repo market seizure, the Covid-19 pandemic, and the Silicon Valley Bank crash, claiming that in each instance, the Fed’s solution was the same, print more money.“It’s not a new crisis... it’s the same crisis getting bigger,” he argued, describing what he sees as a pattern of systemic failure. He warned that America has now become “the biggest debtor nation in history...because of the FED,” and reaffirmed his belief that “The Biggest Crash in history is coming… soon.”According to ET, Kiyosaki has consistently positioned himself as a critic of modern monetary policy and a staunch advocate for alternative stores of value.His posts in recent months have included bullish predictions for silver, with the author claiming the metal is still “significantly undervalued” and suggesting that its price could double.Kiyosaki’s warnings echo a broader scepticism held by some financial commentators about the sustainability of high debt levels and the long-term value of fiat currency in a low-interest, high-liquidity environment.While his views are controversial, they continue to resonate with a growing number of investors seeking protection from perceived monetary instability.This latest post reaffirms Kiyosaki’s core message, steer clear of cash and paper assets and instead prioritise tangible alternatives to safeguard long-term wealth.(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market and other asset classes given by experts are their own.

The cumulative funding for more than 31,000 tech start ups has exceeded $70 billion.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-107262111,imgsize-64556,width-400,resizemode-4/107262111.jpg"
Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021.

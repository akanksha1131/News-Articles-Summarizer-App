Silver prices soared to a record high on the Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX) on Friday as the December 2025 futures contract climbed to Rs 1,70,415 per kilogram. This marks an increase of Rs 1,977 or 1.18% for the day.The surge in silver prices has resulted in a remarkable 19.8% gain for the month of October, rising from a closing price of Rs 1,42,145 on September 30. This significant monthly increase highlights strong festive demand and growing industrial interest in the metal.The recent rally has sparked renewed interest in silver's long-term potential, with analysts attributing the uptrend to solid underlying fundamentals. Mahendra Patil, Founder and Managing Partner at MP Financial Advisory Services LLP (MPFASL), noted that silver is experiencing ""a phase of structural endurance rather than speculative exuberance"", as quoted by Economic Times.Patil pointed out that while silver has historically been volatile, its past performance offers valuable insights. The metal previously approached the $50 per ounce mark in 1980 and 2011, and with 2025 marking its third such approach, the focus is now on whether it can maintain sustained momentum.In 2025, silver prices surged from $29 to over $47 per ounce, reaching ""its highest level in more than a decade."" MPFASL attributes this momentum to several factors, including ""higher expectations from US rate cuts, sustained central-bank buying, and industrial restocking across solar and electronics supply chains.""Highlighting silver's dual appeal, Patil said, ""Silver is gaining ground as both a symbolic and practical substitute. Beyond its decorative appeal, the industrial demand linked to solar panels, electronics, and electric mobility provides fundamental support to prices, creating a dual-use demand base that gold lacks.""The rise in silver demand is not limited to global markets. In India, silver imports have increased significantly. ""Silver imports have expanded, reflecting its growing relevance as an industrial and investment metal within the renewable-energy and electronics value chains,"" MPFASL reported.Data from the firm also revealed that silver delivered an annualized return of 32.92% in the CY2023–CY2025 period, with a volatility of 24.66%, based on historical performance. The correlation between gold and silver during this period stood at 0.95, indicating closely linked price movements, although silver's trajectory has increasingly been driven by industrial factors.Looking ahead, MPFASL suggests that silver may continue to benefit from its industrial underpinnings. ""Silver exceeded expectations, crossing $47 per ounce on renewed industrial restocking in solar and electronics,"" the report noted.Most projections indicate that silver is expected to remain in the $44–50 per ounce range through FY2026. While gold may experience consolidation, ""silver amplified the momentum as the cyclical bellwether of a broader industrial revival.""As India enters the festive season and global industrial restocking continues, the metal's trajectory will likely depend on sustained demand from the electronics and renewable sectors. MPFASL adds that silver's ability to surpass the $50 per ounce mark may depend on whether it can ""finally build sustained momentum and move toward the next big landmark, its metaphorical 'century.'""For domestic traders, Rs 1,70,415 now serves as a key resistance level on MCX. With industrial and festive tailwinds in play, attention will remain on whether silver can build upon this rally or consolidate near its current highs.","Silver prices soared to a record high on the Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX) on Friday.

The dilemma on festival dates

Muhurat Trading 2025: A blend of tradition and finance



Remaining stock market holidays for the year





As Diwali approaches, many are uncertain whether the festival falls on October 20 or 21 this year. As for stock markets, investors would also like to know definitive dates of the days when trading will not happen. They have a definitive date to note: the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) and National Stock Exchange (NSE) will be closed on Tuesday, October 21, for Diwali Lakshmi Puja, and again on Wednesday, October 22, for Balipratipada.However, on October 21, a special trading activity will occur which is the traditional Muhurat Trading session, a symbolic ritual lasting one hour, from 1:45 PM to 2:45 PM. This session will allow trading across various segments, including equities, futures and options, currency and commodity derivatives, and securities lending and borrowing (SLB), with modifications permitted until 2:55 PM.The confusion arises because the lunar calendar's Amavasya tithi, or new moon phase, technically extends into October 21. However, the auspicious time for Lakshmi Puja is on the evening of October 20, leading most households to celebrate then. The following day marks the start of the new Hindu Samvat year, celebrated with the Muhurat Trading session on Dalal Street.This year, the Muhurat session will occur in the afternoon on October 21, a departure from recent years when it was held in the evening.Additionally, markets are closed on October 18 for Dhanteras and October 19 for the regular weekend schedule.Muhurat Trading, meaning ""auspicious hour,"" is more than just a market event. It symbolizes the beginning of Samvat 2082, the new Hindu financial year. For investors, it represents optimism and a prayer for prosperity rather than a focus on profits.This tradition has persisted for decades, often bringing positive returns. The Sensex has closed higher in 14 of the past 18 Muhurat sessions. Even during the 2008 global financial crisis, the index rose by 5.86% during the session. In 2024, it gained 335 points, or 0.42%, continuing the trend of festive cheer.Analysts, as quoted by ET, point out that trading volumes are typically low during this one-hour window, leading to potential volatility. However, the session is not seen as a typical trading day but rather a symbolic reset, where traders, families, and brokers come together to mark a hopeful start to the new year.After October 22, only two more holidays remain for stock markets part from the regular Saturdays and Sundays. Markets will be shut on November 5 for Prakash Gurpurb Sri Guru Nanak Dev and December 25 for Christmas"," Bombay Stock Exchange and National Stock Exchange will be closed on Tuesday, October 21, for Diwali Lakshmi Puja, and again on Wednesday, October 22, for Balipratipada.

Gold price prediction: Where are gold prices headed in the near term? Why investors should not chase the rally,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gold-price-prediction-today-where-are-gold-rates-headed-on-october-21-2025-and-in-the-near-term-diwali/articleshow/124714972.cms,"Gold may see some correction ahead of the US CPI and PMI reports to be released on October 24 as hot inflation data may hurt December cut chances. (AI image)

Gold Performance:

On October 20, spot gold, despite easing US-China trade tensions and subsiding bad loan concerns involving US regional banks, quickly reversed its nearly 0.75% decline to $4219 in the Asian session to rise sharply to $4355 in the US session. Bad loan concerns eased as the US regional banks posted encouraging results.

Although on October 20, Trump threatened China with 155% tariff rate if no deal by November 1, gold had already rallied to its session’s high by then.

At the time of writing this article, spot gold was trading with a gain of 2.11% at $4345. The MCX December gold contract was changing hands at 103,443, up 2.70% for the day.

Earlier, the yellow metal extended its weekly winning streak to the ninth consecutive week as it closed with a weekly gain of nearly 5.75% at $4251 in the week ending October 17.

Silver Shines Brighter Than Gold This Dhanteras Amid High Prices

Data roundup:

Chinese data on October 20 were largely encouraging as Q3 GDP at 4.8% annualized rate came in line with the forecast, while industrial production at 2.9% and retail sales data at 6.5% topped their respective forecasts of 3% and 5%.

US-China talks:

US Treasury Secretary Bessent and Vice Premier He Lifeng will have the next round of trade talks next week in Malaysia, which will prepare ground for presidential meetings.

US President is set to meet with Chinese President Xi in South Korea in a couple of weeks. Trump has listed rare earths, fentanyl and soybeans as top US issues with China. He wants China to resume soybean purchases

Dollar Index and yields:

At the time of writing this article, the US Dollar Index was noted at 98.52, up nearly 0.10% for the day.

Ten-year US yields were hovering around 2.99%, while two-year yields at 3.46% were up by nearly one-bps.

Gold ETF holdings and COMEX stocks:

As of October 17, total known global gold ETF holdings stood at 98.23 MOz, a new cycle high, as holdings rose for the seventh straight week.

Gold ETF holdings have recorded a net inflow of 15.38 MOz YTD, which amounts to a net inflow of 478 tons this year so far.

Of late, huge ETF inflow has played a crucial role in pushing up gold prices.

COMEX gold stocks stand at 39.10 MOz, a decline of 13.26% from the record inventory level of 45.07 MOz noted in April.

China's fourth plenum:

The Chinese Communist Party is holding the fourth plenary session of its 20th central committee in a four-day closed-door meeting from October 20 to 23. A proposal of the CCP Central Committee on formulating the 15th five-year plan for National and Social Development will be discussed at the plenum and if approved, it will be approved at the 'Two Sessions' - China's annual parliamentary and political consultative meetings - in March 2026.

Upcoming data:

Major US data on deck this week include Philadelphia Fed non-manufacturing activity (October 21), weekly job data (October 23), existing home sales (October 23), CPI (October 24), S&P global US PMIs (October 24), University of Michigan sentiment and inflation expectations (October 24). Some of the data may get delayed due to the ongoing partial shutdown of the US government.

Eurozone's PMIs will be out on October 24.

Focus will be mainly on the US CPI data as traders try to assess the Fed’s monetary policy trajectory. Hot inflation data will affect rate cut chances.

Gold Price Outlook:

Given the fact that both equities and gold have been rallying mostly together, the current gold rally is driven mostly by ETF inflows and late buyers as traders focus on the FOMC monetary policy decision due on October 29 wherein the Fed is expected to cut rates by 25 bps. It is to be noted that both markets and the Fed expect two more rate cuts by the year-end with the next rate cut to take place in December.

US-China tensions may also be driving the rally as China has yet to make its stand clear, though risk assets remain well bid.

Trump’s China threats on Monday did not dent the risk sentiments.

Gold may see some correction ahead of the US CPI and PMI reports to be released on October 24 as hot inflation data may hurt December cut chances as October rate cut is almost a done deal.

In the near-term, gold is expected to be highly volatile due to US-China headlines.

Buying the dips is preferred over chasing the rally at this point, though the metal may quickly surge to $4500 in case US-China tensions escalate.

Support is at $4200/$4116/$4000. Resistance is at $4400/$4500.

We look for a target of $5000 in a year’s timeframe.

Silver: Buy the dips



Performance:

At the time of writing this article, spot silver was trading with a gain of 0.50% at $52.17.

Spot silver closed with a weekly gain of 3.42% at 51.92 in the week ending October 17 as it extended its weekly winning streak to the ninth straight week, which mirrors the gold’s streak.

Silver, supported by an extremely tight market due to ETF led demand, has rallied over 40% since August 1 as it hit a fresh record high of $54.47 on October 17.

Global Silver ETF holdings:

Silver ETF holdings stand at 823.23 MOz as holdings slid from cycle high of 833.41 MOz as noted on October 14.

Total known silver ETF holdings have risen 15.26% YTD as ETF inflows this year amount to a net inflow of 3,390 tons of silver.

Silver is now the largest cost component in a solar module production

After steep price increase, silver is now the largest cost component in solar module production as it overtook aluminum and PV glass. As per Bloomberg calculation, current silver price translates to over 17% of the per-watt price of solar modules.

Silver Price Outlook:

Silver may see profit booking ahead of the US CPI and PMI reports. However, overall, outlook remains constructive.

Considering the steep rise in silver prices since August 1, it is advisable to buy the dips rather than chase the rally.

Support is at $50.62/$50/$46. Resistance is at $55/$56.10.

If risk appetite remains reasonably healthy, silver may rise to $56/$58 level by the year-end.

We expect the metal to reach $75-$100 in next three to five years as we look for a target of $60-$65 in a year’s timeframe.

Trump SHOCKS Putin With US Policy Shift; Kyiv Can Now Fire Storm Shadow Missiles Deep Inside Russia





The Donald Trump-led US administration on Wednesday imposed sanctions on Russia’s two largest oil producers, Rosneft and Lukoil, intensifying pressure on the Kremlin to end its war in Ukraine. The move marks one of Washington’s largest-ever sanctions packages against Moscow, announced after Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent accused Vladimir Putin of not engaging “honestly” in talks with the US president.“President Putin has not come to the table in an honest and forthright manner, as we'd hoped,” Bessent told Fox Business, adding that Trump was “disappointed at where we are in these talks.”The new measures target Russia’s two biggest oil firms -- Rosneft and Lukoil -- following the collapse of ceasefire discussions between Washington and Moscow. The announcement came a day after a planned Trump-Putin summit in Budapest was called off amid US frustration over the lack of progress in peace negotiations.Also read: Donald Trump claims India will cut down Russian oil imports by year end “Given President Putin's refusal to end this senseless war, Treasury is sanctioning Russia's two largest oil companies that fund the Kremlin's war machine,” Bessent said in a statement. He added that the Treasury Department was ready “to take further action if necessary” to back Trump’s push to end the conflict.Speaking ahead of the official announcement, Bessent described the move as “one of the largest sanctions that we have done against the Russian Federation.”Trump had resisted imposing new penalties for months, hoping to convince Putin to pursue peace despite mounting tensions. However, his patience reportedly ran out in the six days following their phone call last Thursday.Bessent recalled that during the leaders’ August meeting in Alaska, “President Trump walked away when he realized that things were not moving forward.” He added, “There have been behind-the-scenes talks, but I believe that the president is disappointed at where we are in these talks.”The European Union also announced fresh sanctions against Moscow on Wednesday, including a ban on Russian liquefied natural gas imports by 2027, the blacklisting of oil tankers used by Russia, and new travel restrictions for Russian diplomats.Also read: US sanctions major Russian oil firms; move amid Putin's 'refusal to end senseless war' Since returning to office in January, Trump has repeatedly threatened sanctions but held off, hoping to broker an end to the three-and-a-half-year conflict. He initially believed progress was possible after last week’s call with Putin and even floated a meeting in Budapest within two weeks.However, his stance shifted after Kyiv officials said Trump had pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to concede territory while rejecting his request for long-range Tomahawk missiles. By Tuesday, Trump said he didn’t want a “wasted meeting,” effectively shelving the planned summit.News of the sanctions sent oil prices higher in after-hours trading, with both WTI and Brent benchmarks rising by more than one percent.","US imposes sanctions on Russia's two largest oil producers, Rosneft and Lukoil.

Tesla Q3 results: Profits fell despite rising sales—Here's what Musk plans next,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/tesla-q3-figures-profits-fell-despite-rising-salesheres-what-musk-plans-next/articleshow/124750790.cms,"Sales rise, profits fall





Analysts weigh in

What’s next — Musk’s robo army?









Tesla reported a decline in its quarterly profits for the fourth consecutive time, even as its sales grew, sending the company’s shares down by 3.5% in after-hours trading.For its third quarter, the electric car maker led by Elon Musk , posted earnings of $1.4 billion, or 39 cents per share, a 37% drop from $2.2 billion, or 62 cents per share, recorded a year earlier.Tesla reported a sharp fall in profits on Wednesday, saying higher costs and tariffs outweighed gains from increased car sales, according to AFP.While revenue rose to $28.1 billion from $25.2 billion, the increase came with a notable caveat: many customers accelerated purchases to take advantage of the $7,500 federal EV tax credit before it expired on October 1, potentially pulling demand from the corresponding quarter.Tesla’s revenue boost was not unexpected. EV sales, which had slumped for much of the year, rose 7% in the quarter. The company also benefited from strong sales in its battery storage and electric charging businesses, though electric vehicles continue to drive most of its revenue.Gross margins, a key measure of profitability after covering costs like staff and materials, reached 18%, the highest this year but down from 25% four years ago.Earnings excluding certain charges fell to 50 cents per share, below Wall Street’s forecast of 56 cents and last year’s 72 cents.Musk had predicted 20% to 30% sales growth for 2025, but those expectations have not materialised. His alignment with right-wing politicians and the absence of new, exciting, or lower-priced vehicles has drawn criticism, while early October launches of stripped-down versions of the Model Y and Model X, priced just under $40,000, failed to impress investors.Despite the profit decline, some remain optimistic. “It’s nice to have revenue come back,” said Brian Mulberry, senior client portfolio manager at Zacks Investment Management. “There is still strong demand for Teslas.”“It's a positive that they are increasingly diversifying from the auto business, but our primary concern is demand for EVs,” said Garrett Nelson, an analyst at CFRA Research with a “sell” rating on Tesla stock. “There’s a lot of uncertainty.”Other experts predicted no uptick in the sales figures till the electric maker launches a new vehicle.""We believe that for Tesla to return to growth on a sustainable basis requires an expansion of the company's lineup,"" said JPMorgan in an October 3 note.Wedbush analyst Dan Ives also pointed to early next year as a timeframe for new models, while highlighting Musk's progress on autonomous, robotic and artificial intelligence as a key focus for investors.""We continue to strongly believe the most important chapter in Tesla's growth story is now beginning with the AI era now here,"" said Ives, who projects autonomous technologies will lift Tesla's market valuation by $1 trillion.In a conference call with investors, Musk shifted focus from vehicle sales to Tesla’s broader ambitions, highlighting its driverless robotaxi service, AI projects, and Optimus robots for homes and factories.“It’ll seem so real, that you’ll need to poke it,” Musk said of the Optimus robot. He also predicted that the so-called “robot army” could become “the biggest product of all time,” according to AP.He also expressed confidence in Tesla’s robotaxi service, announcing plans to remove “safety monitors” from the driver’s seat in Austin, Texas, by the end of the year.The service, already available in San Francisco, is expected to expand to up to ten other metropolitan areas before year-end.","Tesla reported a sharp fall in profits on Wednesday, saying higher costs and tariffs outweighed gains from increased car sales.

Key economic indicators will see major revamp in early 2026,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/key-economic-indicators-will-see-major-revamp-in-early-2026/articleshow/124750320.cms,"



NEW DELHI: India’s economic dashboard is getting a long-overdue makeover in early 2026. From GDP and retail inflation to industrial output, several major measures of economic activity will be updated to reflect how people live, earn and spend today. A new index to track the booming services sector — from logistics to digital platforms — will also make its debut, offering a sharper picture of what drives the country’s growth.First off the block will be the GDP data, with 2022-23 prices, which will be unveiled on Feb 27 when advance estimates are released. This means that the budget-making exercise, which depends on the first advance estimates released Jan 7, will use the existing series. In Feb, the ministry of statistics and programme implementation will put out the updated retail inflation data, with 2023-24 base, measuring price rise for Jan.And, in April, the new index of industrial production with a 2022-23 base will be released. This will be followed by the services sector index, estimating the largest component in India’s economy for the first time. The index has been in the making for close to two decades and seen to be crucial, especially as the role of new sectors, such as the digital economy and logistics, increases in everyday life.The new data line-up is seen to be the biggest upgrade in recent years with the base year set to be changed after over a decade. Currently, official estimates are based on 2011-12 prices and the consumption basket has also seen a massive change in these years, with the share of food coming down and products such as smartphones becoming mass-used items, replacing feature phones.Besides, it seeks to tackle crucial gaps in the current data, where products such as food offered through the public distribution system, do not carry any expenditure share since there is no out of pocket spend by households. The ministry is currently undertaking a revision of the consumer price index (CPI) with the objective of updating item weights, revising the consumption basket and incorporating methodological improvements to strengthen the index.","India's economic dashboard is getting a long-overdue makeover in early 2026. From GDP and retail inflation to industrial output, several major measures of economic activity will be updated. A new index to track the booming services sector — from logistics to digital platforms — will also make its debut.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124750349,imgsize-34362,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

"Sahara’s Lucknow HQ was central to all money laundering activities, ED tells HC",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/saharas-lucknow-hq-was-central-to-all-money-laundering-activities-ed-tells-hc/articleshow/124750106.cms,"



NEW DELHI: Enforcement Directorate has told Allahabad high court that all deposit-taking entities of Sahara group used the same set of branches of Sahara India , same set of agents and other infrastructure, including bank accounts, and that at the time of re-deposit of funds, there was no bank account transfer and only books of different entities were adjusted.The group’s headquarters in Lucknow was central to all alleged money laundering activities that involved deposits of around Rs 25,000 crore, the probe agency said.In an affidavit filed recently, ED said, “At the time of redeposit of funds, there was no bank account transfer and only books of different entities were adjusted. Thus, all key decisions were taken by the head office at Lucknow”. The agency accused the group’s chairman, managing director and board members of their involvement in the alleged ‘scam’.“The maturity amount of one scheme of Sahara group was re-deposited into an existing ‘new’ scheme and for that no bank account transfer used to take place. The depositors were left with no option but to re-deposit in its other existing scheme since the branch office of Sahara India was not making repayment,” ED claimed. The court prima facie held that Sahara group entities were involved in alleged money laundering as they continued to receive deposits despite a restriction imposed by SC.In 2023, SC asked Sahara group to transfer Rs 5,000 crore, out of total Rs 24,979.6 crore lying in the Sahara-Sebi refund account, to central registrar of cooperative societies, who, in turn, would disburse it against legitimate dues of depositors.","The group’s headquarters in Lucknow was central to all alleged money laundering activities that involved deposits of around Rs 25,000 crore. “At the time of redeposit of funds, there was no bank account transfer and only books of different entities were adjusted.

"To reduce disputes, NHAI starts putting land acquisition, clearances data online",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/to-reduce-disputes-nhai-starts-putting-land-acquisition-clearances-data-online/articleshow/124748386.cms,"



NEW DELHI: The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has started putting details of land acquisition status and statutory clearances for each highway project — tenders of which are out or will be floated — online. This is aimed at bringing greater transparency, and reducing disputes and arbitrations after projects are bid out.The exercise began on Wednesday and the dynamic status of conditions to be fulfilled before every project will now be updated regularly, allowing bidders to have a clear understanding of project readiness before placing bids, a senior NHAI official said. “This will also put pressure on us, as an authority, to fulfil our obligations, which are crucial for project execution. It will also ensure a level playing field for contractors,” the official added.TOI has learnt that the authority has made data such as land acquisition details, environmental approvals, and forest, wildlife, railway and waterway clearances — mandatory for project execution — available for each project.In the last Parliament session, the road transport ministry had informed Rajya Sabha that 489 NH projects, originally slated for completion by March 2025, were running behind schedule due to delays in land acquisition, forest and wildlife clearances, and railway approvals.“Such delays result in time and cost overrun, and disputes. The only way to avoid disputes and arbitrations is to ensure that authorities meet all the conditions precedent for start of construction. Once this is done, default on the part of contractors can be dealt with easily as there will be no scope for counter charges,” said a senior official.In another decision, the NHAI announced deployment of network survey vehicles (NSVs) in 23 states, covering 20,933 km of NHs, to gather detailed road inventory and pavement condition data, such as surface cracking, potholes and patches, so that corrective maintenance can be carried out expeditiously.A 3D laser-based NSV system is capable of capturing and reporting road defects automatically without human intervention with the help of high-resolution 360-degree cameras, differential GPS, inertial measurement units, and distance-measuring indicators.","National Highways Authority of India has started putting details of land acquisition status and statutory clearances for each highway project online.

Dhanteras 2025:

But will this rally continue? Are gold and silver good investment bets over the next year? We ask experts what the gold and silver price outlook is and what levels will they hit by Dhanteras 2026:

Dhanteras 2025: Should you buy gold and silver this year?

What’s the gold price outlook till next Dhanteras?

Gold — Diwali/Dhanteras 2026 target: ₹1,40,000–₹1,45,000+ Bull case 160000+ if geopolitical risk escalates or Fed turns very dovish. For the 12-month horizon to Dhanteras 2026, maintaining the bullish structural view, expect upside if the macro tailwinds persist — Fed cuts, weak dollar, tariffs/ geopolitical premium.Since the price has shown sharp up move recently, its advisable to allocate in dips and parts.

Silver — Dhanteras/Diwali 2026 target: ₹1,85,000–₹2,10,000/kg; Bull case ₹2,20,000–₹2,50,000+ on stronger industrial demand Central banks buying and continued ETF flows.

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market and other asset classes given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)





Buying gold and silver is traditionally considered auspicious on Dhanteras . The precious metals have been hitting new record highs this year - with the gold rally backed by global uncertainty and diversification away from dollar and the silver bull run driven by high industrial demand and acute physical tightness in London and Comex inventories.Investors who bet on gold and silver last Dhanteras and Diwali have seen bonanza returns. According to Manav Modi, Senior Analyst, Commodity Research at Motilal Oswal Financial Services, gold and silver on the domestic front have gained by over 61% and 69% respectively from 2024 Dhanteras to till now.Manav Modi is of the view that both gold and silver could be on dips from a long term perspective as an investment. “However, one should be cautious at these levels for a dip or profit booking which could provide a better entry or purchase level,” he tells TOI.Jateen Trivedi, VP Research Analyst - Commodity and Currency, LKP Securities believes that while gold and silver are good bets, investors should not chase the peak.“For festival buying (ritual/jewellery) buy as per need; for investment, favoursystematic accumulation (SIP/laddered buys), ETFs or Sovereign Gold Bonds (SGBs) over lump-sum physical purchases at all-time highs. Silver offers higher upside potential but comes with higher volatility,” he advises.Praveen Singh, Head of Commodities, Mirae Asset ShareKhan says that both gold and silver have strong fundamentals to rise further in the coming years.“⁠Both the metals are expected to gain further on economic, political, and geopolitical uncertainties as the US Federal Reserve cuts rates into elevated inflation. De-dollarization, central banks buying gold, inflation hedge buying, long-term government bonds losing their appeal, dent in investors’ trust in US institutions, and tariff wars will continue to provide strong tailwinds for precious metals,” he tells TOI.Gold and Silver are still poised for further upside, says Manav Modi. “Overall, from a one year perspective, Gold on COMEX could target $4250 and $4500 assuming USD-INR at 89; Rs 1,28,500 and 1,35,000. Similarly, Silver could target $75 on COMEX, from a long term perspective and Rs 2,30,000 on domestic front,” he says.Praveen Singh expects gold to reach $5000 sometime around next Dhanteras, while silver is expected to rise to $60 level. “So, silver can gain 17%, while gold may gain 21% in a year. However, due to physical market tightness in London and Indian Silver markets, it is possible that silver may beat gold in the short term, though we expect that this tightness will not last long,” he says.Abhilash Koikkara, EVP & Head- Forex and Commodities, Nuvama Professional Clients Group is of the view that over the next 12 months, silver could maintain its outperformance over gold as gold offers portfolio stability and capital protection. “From a technical perspective, silver exhibits stronger bullish signals compared to gold, indicating a higher likelihood of outperforming gold by Dhanteras 2026,” he tells TOI.“Analytically, gold suits conservative wealth preservation, while silver suits risk-adjusted alpha seekers,” he adds.Trivedi notes that Gold has compounded at roughly 30.6% p.a., Silver 33% p.a., and Nifty 24% p.a. — silver has outperformed in percentage terms recently though gold remains the steadier hedge.Trivedi highlights LKP Securities’s working framework and targets (domestic, per 10 g / per kg):","Investors who bet on gold and silver last Dhanteras and Diwali have seen bonanza returns. Both the metals are expected to gain further on economic, political, and geopolitical uncertainties as the US Federal Reserve cuts rates into elevated inflation.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124665282,imgsize-56388,width-400,resizemode-4/gold-price-outlook.jpg"

Earlier, he had criticised this move saying, ""Well then, they're going to just keep paying a lot of tariffs if they said that, but I don't believe they said that. No, I spoke with Prime Minister Modi of India and he said he's not going to be doing the Russian oil thing.""Talking about China situation, which could face 155% tariffs from November 1 if no deals are made, he said, ""China is a little bit different. They have a little bit different relationship with Russia. It was never good, but because of Biden and Obama, they got forced together. They should never have been forced together... They (China-Russia) can't be friendly... I hope they are friendly, but they can't be... Biden and Obama forced them together because of energy and oil. They are closer than they would normally be. I'll probably be talking about it. What I'll really be talking to him about is how do we end the war with Russia and Ukraine, whether it's through oil or energy or anything else.

Warner Bros rejects Paramount’s $60 billion buy offer; looking at alternatives: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/warner-bros-rejects-paramounts-60-billion-buy-offer-looking-at-alternatives-report/articleshow/124735905.cms,"Major shake up





Entertainment giant Warner Bros Discovery’s board has reportedly turned down a nearly $60 billion takeover offer from Paramount Skydance, a source told Reuters on Tuesday (local time). The company also announced that it will now look at other options for a possible sale.The board had rejected a mostly cash offer of around $24 per share for the company, whose assets include the Warner Bros film and TV studios, CNN, several cable networks, and the HBO Max streaming service. Shares of Warner Bros Discovery closed 11% higher on Tuesday.According to another source, Comcast may review the media giant’s assets as well. Netflix is also among the interested buyers, CNBC reported, following earlier reports that Paramount Skydance CEO David Ellison had been in talks to buy the entire company.Warner Bros, known for film franchises like Harry Potter and DC Comics, announced in June that it planned to divide its business into two parts by next year: one focused on studios and another on cable networks. The move aims to separate its fast-growing streaming segment from its weaker cable operations.The company said its board will now weigh several options, including going ahead with the planned split, selling the entire company, or pursuing separate deals for its Warner Bros or Discovery Global businesses. It is also considering another structure that could merge Warner Bros with a spinoff of Discovery Global.A sale or breakup of Warner Bros Discovery would be one of the biggest shake-ups in the global media landscape. The rise of streaming has already changed how audiences watch content, pulling viewers away from traditional TV and cutting into advertising income.Any buyer of Warner Bros Discovery would gain control of a major Hollywood studio and a leading streaming platform but would also take on its massive $35 billion debt.The company, valued at around $45.36 billion, has seen its shares rise more than 46% since early September, when reports of Paramount’s interest first emerged.“Paramount is the most likely to purchase the company. For Netflix, a purchase would make more sense following the planned split because the studio would be very valuable to Netflix but the TV networks not as much,” said eMarketer senior analyst Ross Benes told Reuters.Warner Bros Discovery had already rejected an earlier bid from Paramount, which offered about $20 per share, as it was seen as too low, two sources told Reuters.Bank of America research analyst Jessica Reif Ehrlich estimated that the company’s full value was closer to $30 per share, given its rich portfolio of entertainment assets. “Given the company's wealth of premium IP (Harry Potter, DC, Lord of the Rings, Game of Thrones, etc.) and robust library, we continue to believe Warner Bros is an extremely attractive potential acquisition target,” she said in an investor note.Meanwhile, Comcast is preparing to spin off its NBCUniversal cable channels, such as USA Network and CNBC, into a new company called Versant later this year.“Potential WBD suitors, including Paramount, Comcast, Netflix, Amazon and Apple, could see value in moving sooner rather than later to acquire the entirety of WBD versus waiting to purchase just the streaming and studios assets,” Seth Shafer, principal analyst at S&P Global Market Intelligence Kagan told the news agency.",Warner Bros Discovery's board has rejected a nearly $60 billion takeover offer from Paramount Skydance.

Will Canada buy German-made submarines?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/will-canada-buy-german-made-submarines/articleshow/124732946.cms,"German defence minister Boris Pistorius (Image credits: AP)

A new Cold War



Tracking Russian submarines from Iceland



Rare earths as well as defence



Is the Bundeswehr overextended?



No decision yet







In the Canadian capital, Ottawa, on Monday, the defence ministers of Norway and Germany, Tore Sandvik and Boris Pistorius , received military honors from their Canadian counterpart, David McGuinty, at the start of what might informally be described as a sales presentation.Sandvik and Pistorius want to convince the Canadians to join a German–Norwegian project that has been running since 2023, to procure standardised, modern submarines. They hope to secure an order from Canada of up to 12 units over the next 10 years.This would provide a significant boost to the German and Norwegian companies that are building these submarines. As McGuinty pointed out, if Canada came on board, production numbers could be substantially increased, and this would reduce the cost of each submarine.The German delegation believes that going into partnership on submarine construction would clearly signal a strengthening of North Atlantic naval cooperation. Last year, Germany, Norway, and Canada formally established a maritime security partnership, which Denmark also joined this year.After the end of the Cold War, submarines in the Atlantic were no longer considered a priority, and Germany drastically reduced its fleet.However, with Russia once again regarded as a significant threat in the Baltic Sea and the North Atlantic, the submarine fleet is growing. And the emphasis is not just on submarines. German defence minister Pistorius said that northern Nato countries were strengthening their commitment to protect critical infrastructure, such as undersea cables and offshore wind farms, and detect Russian submarines in the North Atlantic.""Russia's ambition will not stop in eastern Ukraine or at the eastern flank,"" he said. ""The civilian and military lines of communication across the North Atlantic are vitally important […] for our economy and our defence alliance with Canada and the United States.""The German navy is to increase its presence, with more ships in the waters around the Arctic Circle. Special P-8 Poseidon reconnaissance aircraft, which can detect submarines over great distances, will be deployed more frequently from Iceland.Pistorius co-signed a declaration of intent to this effect while on a brief visit to Reykjavik on Sunday, with Iceland's foreign minister, Katrin Gunnarsdottir.The US navy operates the large Keflavik base in Iceland, from which the North Atlantic is monitored. Various Nato countries send reconnaissance aircraft to Keflavik, in rotation. The US shut down the base in 2006, but reopened it in 2016 in view of the growing threat from Russia.Although Iceland is a member of Nato, it does not have a military of its own, so any external support is very welcome. In return, it provides logistical assistance at its ports, accommodation, and training grounds for German soldiers.During the talks in Canada, Pistorius also pushed for an expansion of the strategic and economic partnership. This partnership was only formalised in August, when the Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney was in Berlin to meet with the German chancellor Friedrich Merz.Canada could, for example, export more liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) to Europe. Germany is keen to reciprocate by assisting with the exploration and extraction of coveted rare earth elements.These metals are needed primarily for high-end electronics and microchips. At the meeting in Ottawa, the Canadian side commented that its European allies were keen to reduce their dependence on China, and the United States.US President Donald Trump has imposed high tariffs on Canadian imports. Until recently, the US was by far the largest customer for Canada's goods and raw materials, accounting for 75% of its volume of trade. That is now starting to change. Canadian diplomats say Canada will be focusing more on Europe in future.When asked by a journalist whether the German Bundeswehr (armed forces) risks becoming overextended, with so many foreign commitments, in Lithuania, the Baltic Sea, Canada, and Iceland, Pistorius responded with a smile. This, he said, was ""a typically German question."" He pointed out that Germany was the largest Nato country in Europe, and, as such: ""We have to bear more of the burden. We have to demonstrate that. ""Pistorius explained that the Bundeswehr can't be everywhere. It has to prioritise. ""Just as other Nato countries focus more on the south, the Mediterranean region, the Middle East, or North Africa, we are focused on the Baltic Sea, the Baltic region, the eastern flank, and the Nordic countries.""He then affirmed that: ""We will be in a position to manage all this with our current personnel, and the personnel we will add in future.""Following the talks in Ottawa, Canada still has not made a decision about joining the submarine project with Germany and Norway. In the coming days, the Canadian Prime Minister, Mark Carney, is due to travel to South Korea, where he will be met with another big sales presentation. South Korea is also keen to secure an order for 12 new submarines from Canada.After a long day of negotiations, Canadian defence minister McGuinty addressed his German and Norwegian counterparts, but without going into specifics. ""This partnership is active, it is evolving. It is vital to addressing today's global challenges,"" he said.German defence minister Pistorius said only: ""It's looking hopeful.""",Tore Sandvik and Boris Pistorius want to convince Canada to join a submarine project.

He said on Tuesday that he expected a “good” trade deal with Xi at the APEC summit in South Korea next week. ""I think we're going to have a very successful meeting.

Trump Aide’s ‘Unhinged’ Criticism ‘Prompts’ China To Shake Up Trade Team; Xi’s Rare Move





Amid an escalating tariff war with Beijing, US President Donald Trump on Tuesday said he wants to be “nice” to China but claimed that the country has been “very rough” with the United States over the years because America “never had smart presidents from a business standpoint. ”The 79-year-old businessman-turned-president made the remarks while responding to a question from ANI on whether Washington would impose tariffs on China for buying crude oil from Russia. The comments came during Diwali celebrations at the White House, where Trump lit ceremonial lamps.“I want to be nice to China. But China has been very rough with us over the years because we had presidents that weren’t smart from a business standpoint. They allowed China and every other country to take advantage of us,” Trump said.He added that starting November 1, China could face tariffs of about 155%, calling the situation “unsustainable” for Beijing. Trump argued that his tariff policies have boosted US national security and brought in “hundreds of billions, even trillions of dollars” in revenue.“We’re getting hundreds of billions, even trillions of dollars paid into the United States...We’ll start paying off debt,” he said, adding that the administration might soon make a “distribution” from tariff earnings to American citizens.Trump further claimed that the United States had collected $650 billion from the European Union, $550 billion from Japan and $350 billion from South Korea through trade duties.“Now we’re taking a lot of money, and it keeps people like this here because that’s why they’re coming in,” he remarked.During the same interaction, Trump said he had spoken to Prime Minister Narendra Modi , asserting that India had “cut back” on buying Russian oil.“He’s not going to buy much oil from Russia. He wants to see that war end as much as I do,” Trump said, referring to the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine.Trump’s latest remarks came a day after he said he wanted to strike a “fair” and “fantastic” trade deal with Chinese President Xi Jinping, while also warning that Beijing could be in “big trouble” if it avoided doing business with the US.“If they don’t do business with us, I think China is in big trouble… I want them to do great. I want them to thrive. But we have to thrive together. It’s a two-way street,” he said earlier this week.Since returning to the White House, Trump has already imposed additional 30% tariffs on Chinese goods, bringing total duties to around 55–57%.He has also warned that the rate could rise further if talks fail. The White House says the tariff measures have earned the US “respect” from Beijing, while Chinese officials have dismissed the approach as counterproductive.The confrontation follows China’s decision to tighten export controls on rare earth elements, citing national security. The US responded by hiking import tariffs on Chinese goods by 100%, raising the total rate on some products to nearly 130%.Earlier this week, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that as many as 85 senators were ready to back Trump’s authority to impose tariffs of up to 500% on Chinese imports over Beijing’s energy trade with Russia, a move that could further escalate tensions between the world’s two largest economies.On Tuesday, the president said he expects to finalize a “good” trade deal with President Xi at next week’s APEC summit in South Korea, adding that he anticipates “a very successful meeting” and noting that “a lot of people… are waiting for it.”He added, however, that the outcome was not guaranteed, saying, “Maybe it won't happen.

"H-1B fears cool, companies hiring from US campuses to gain",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/h-1b-fears-cool-companies-hiring-from-us-campuses-to-gain/articleshow/124731255.cms,"Big Relief For Indians: Donald Trump Clarifies $100K H-1B Fee Won’t Apply To Existing Visa Holders





BENGALURU: The Trump administration's decision to exempt those who are already in the US, including foreign students, from the $100,000 H-1B visa fee is a big win for US companies hiring such talent. Many of these are technology companies, for whom immigrant student talent has proved valuable.For Indian IT services companies, the decision may be less significant. They have historically been transferring talent from India on H-1Bs, and that talent will now require payment of the prohibitive $100,000 fee. But as the IT services companies have been pointing out, their dependence on H-1Bs has diminished substantially. They are increasingly hiring locals, and to the extent they do campus hires of those on F1 student visas, they too will benefit from the Trump administration’s latest decision.Phil Fersht, CEO at IT consulting firm HFS Research, says the new rules signal a move from volume-driven visas to value-driven visas. “The message is clear: the US wants fewer imported coders and more onshore AI engineers and domain experts,” he says, adding that it forces a reset of the old labour-arbitrage model, pushing IT services companies to invest more in local talent, “as they have already begun to do.”Vivek Wadhwa, CEO of Vionix Biosciences and former distinguished fellow at Harvard Law School and Carnegie Mellon, describes it as “a Trump taco, noise that scared everyone.”As it turned out, he says, it really doesn't impact the vast majority of people on H-1Bs. “It got Trump's base very excited but he misled them as he often does, he made a lot of noise and really didn't do anything. It created a big panic for a month and as it turns out there was nothing to worry about,” he says.Stephen Yale-Loehr, retired professor of immigration law practice at Cornell Law School, also notes that the latest decision means only a few people will be impacted.Indian IT companies file a few thousands of H-1Bs each year for employees in India. Since the first term of the Trump administration and the travel difficulties brought on by the Covid pandemic, IT services companies have been choosing to hire locally, or in near-shore locations like Latin America.Today, nearly 80% of the US workforce at firms like Wipro are local hires. Infosys CEO Salil Parekh has previously said that only a few employees use the firm's immigration services, the remaining already live in the US.TCS has previously said that each year only about 500 people go to the US on the H-1B visa, even though it files for a much larger number of these visas. For Indian students on F1 visas, the decision is a big blessing. They can hope to be hired by US enterprises or startups, since the companies will be exempt from paying the $100,000 fee for them.","Trump administration's decision to exempt those who are already in the US, including foreign students, from the $100,000 H-1B visa fee is a big win for US companies hiring such talent.

Canada’s annual inflation rate climbed to 2.4 per cent in September, slightly above analysts’ expectations, driven by rising grocery prices and moderated declines in gasoline costs, official data showed Tuesday.According to Statistics Canada, food prices rose 3.8 per cent year-on-year, marking the largest increase since April 2024, while gasoline prices declined less than in the same period last year.Excluding gasoline, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased 2.6 per cent. Shelter costs, particularly rents, also contributed, with a 4.8 per cent jump in September, taking overall shelter inflation to 2.6 per cent, according to Reuters.Economists highlighted that core inflation measures remained elevated. The CPI-median stayed at 3.2 per cent, while the CPI-trim edged up to 3.1 per cent, reflecting broad-based price pressures.According to news agency AFP, Prime Minister Mark Carney noted that the government was in “intensive” talks with the United States to reduce sectoral tariffs on steel, aluminum, and energy that have affected Canadian businesses and consumers.While about 85 per cent of cross-border trade remains tariff-free under the USMCA, Trump’s global tariffs have pressured key sectors, particularly steel, aluminum, and autos, leading to job losses and higher input costs.Carney expressed cautious optimism about a potential breakthrough in steel and aluminum, while noting that US auto tariffs remain a risk for Canada, as per AFP.The rise in prices comes ahead of the Bank of Canada’s next policy meeting later this month, with money markets pricing in a strong probability of a 25-basis-point rate cut to 2.25 per cent, aimed at supporting a slowing economy.Analysts have emphasised that despite inflationary pressures, the Canadian economy is weak and in need of monetary support, highlighting the delicate balance policymakers face.Consumers and businesses alike have felt the impact of tariffs and inflation. Canadian grocery stores, heavily reliant on US imports, have raised prices in response to trade measures, while broader sectoral tariffs have amplified costs across steel, aluminum and automotive industries.","Canada's annual inflation rate climbed to 2.4 per cent in September, slightly above analysts’ expectations.

Wall Street opened on a mixed note on Tuesday as investors assessed a wave of strong corporate earnings amid concerns about stretched valuations.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.1 per cent to 46,757.20, while the S&P 500 slipped 0.1 per cent to 6,731.14 and the Nasdaq Composite declined 0.3 per cent to 22,933.67, reported news agency AFP.General Motors (GM) surged 10.2 per cent after reporting quarterly results that surpassed analyst expectations and raising its full-year financial forecasts.According to news agency AP, CEO Mary Barra said the company is taking steps to curb losses in its electric vehicle business by 2026, noting that “it is now clear” EV adoption will be slower than previously planned.Energy services provider Halliburton and diagnostics firm Danaher also climbed more than 8 per cent each after reporting stronger profits than expected, while Coca-Cola rose 3.4 per cent and GE Aerospace advanced 4.2 per cent on upbeat earnings.Warner Bros.

PulteGroup fell 4.1 per cent despite better-than-expected profits, and Northrop Grumman slipped 2.3 per cent after missing revenue forecasts.Tech giants also took a breather, with Alphabet dropping 1.3 per cent from its record high, becoming the heaviest drag on the S&P 500, as per AP.Analyst Patrick O’Hare of Briefing.com said, “The overarching point this morning is that the earnings news for the September quarter continues to be better than expected, and, most importantly, the guidance has been generally reassuring,” according to AFP.Meanwhile, CFRA Research’s Sam Stovall cautioned that “investors are also getting a little concerned by stretched valuations,” amid strong year-to-date gains.Overseas, markets in Europe and Asia were broadly higher.

US And EU Eye Harsh New Tariffs On Russia Buyers, India On Trump's Treasury Secretary’s Radar





The 40 per cent trans-shipment tariff recently announced by the United States is expected to create significant compliance challenges for companies in India and the ASEAN region, particularly in sectors such as machinery, electrical equipment and semiconductors, Moody’s Ratings said on Tuesday.In July, US President Donald Trump imposed the tariff on goods deemed to have been transshipped, adding to broader country-level tariffs.Moody’s noted that the administration has yet to clarify the precise definition of trans-shipment, though the measures appear aimed at products originating in China and routed through third countries with lower duties, as per news agency PTI.“The lack of clarity around the trans-shipment tariff poses risks to ASEAN economies. If the US maintains a narrow interpretation—targeting only minimally processed Chinese goods re-exported to the US—the impact may be limited. However, a broader approach, covering goods with any significant Chinese input, could damage the Asia-Pacific supply chain,” the report said.Moody’s highlighted that private sector exporters will likely face heightened due diligence and certification requirements, needing to prove “substantial transformation” of goods to avoid penalties.The sectors most exposed include machinery, electrical equipment, semiconductors, and consumer optical products, with trans-shipped goods concentrated in intermediate inputs rather than final consumer items.Trans-shipment, a legal practice involving the transfer of goods through hubs such as ports and rail terminals, supports logistical efficiency and supply chain flexibility.However, it can also be used to obscure product origin to evade tariffs—a concern the US seeks to address with this new measure.While Moody’s indicated that Asean’s manufacturing competitiveness will largely remain intact, noting lower labour costs and ongoing “China+1” diversification strategies, the rating agency warned that the tariff could disrupt regional supply chains and increase operational costs for companies heavily reliant on Chinese inputs.Countries most exposed include Vietnam, Malaysia, and Thailand, given their deep integration with Chinese supply chains, with key sectors facing potential credit pressures spanning electronics, solar energy, automotive, machinery, and semiconductors.India could face similar compliance and operational challenges in sectors such as machinery, electrical equipment and consumer optical products, including semiconductors.The move signals the US administration’s increased scrutiny of global trade flows, especially concerning tariff evasion, and may compel companies to reassess sourcing, certification, and logistical arrangements across Asia-Pacific markets.","The 40 per cent trans-shipment tariff recently announced by the United States is expected to create significant compliance challenges for companies in India and the ASEAN region.

'Shameless Schumer': Mike Johnson RIPS 'Lying Democrats' Amid One Of Longest U.S Govt Shutdowns





British consumer goods giant Unilever has postponed the planned demerger of its Magnum Ice Cream business, citing the ongoing US federal government shutdown as the reason for the delay, according to multiple reports.The New York Stock Exchange listing for The Magnum Ice Cream Company, which includes brands such as Ben & Jerry's and Cornetto, cannot proceed because the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is currently unable to declare the registration statement effective, reported news agency AFP.The primary listing had been scheduled for November 10 in Amsterdam, with secondary listings planned in New York and London. Unilever will retain a 19.9 per cent stake in the standalone ice cream business, as per news agency Reuters.The three-week federal shutdown, the longest full closure in US history, has disrupted IPO approvals and affected several sectors, with economists estimating costs of up to $15 billion per week in lost output.DeepGreenX Group, a Seoul-based green energy company, also withdrew its US direct listing due to the shutdown, highlighting wider market disruption.Preparatory work for the demerger remains on track, and Unilever has reassured investors that it is committed to completing the spin-off within 2025, although the timeline will be revised, according to Foodbev Media.Anna Farmbrough, UK quality portfolio manager at Unilever investor Ninety One, was quoted by Reuters as saying, “We’re not concerned by the delay. The timing of the listing isn’t especially important in the broader context — what matters is the quality of the underlying business and its long-term growth prospects”.The demerger is part of Unilever’s broader strategy to streamline operations and focus on core brands. Analysts expect the spin-off will benefit both Unilever and Magnum by allowing each business to concentrate on its market segment and growth potential.The delay underscores the regulatory and operational risks companies face during periods of political gridlock. Unilever also confirmed a general meeting of shareholders is still set to address the proposed consolidation of its share capital, which will now see its timeline adjusted in light of the shutdown.The Magnum ice cream business, a test of consumer demand for premium, sugar-rich products in the US, had been positioned for growth with anticipated secondary listings in New York, London and Amsterdam.","The New York Stock Exchange listing for The Magnum Ice Cream Company cannot proceed because the US Securities and Exchange Commission is currently unable to declare the registration statement effective.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021.

That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas.

Space sector start-up Sisir Radar to develop SAR on L/P band SAR,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/space-sector-start-up-sisir-radar-to-develop-sar-on-l/p-band-sar/articleshow/104558111.cms,"CHENNAI: Space sector startup, Sisir Radar Private Ltd has hit success at the prestigious iDEX DefSpace Challenge with its projects for development of “L/P band Continuous Wave SAR (synthetic aperture radar) payload for LEO Small Satellites” and “Unfurlable, Electronically Steering Antenna for L/P band SAR payload” for Indian Air Force (IAF), said a top company official.The company is promoted by former Director at the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) Tapan Misra and the brains behind the Indian space agency’s RISAT series of SAR satellites as well as the Dual Frequency SAR on the Chandrayaan 2 orbiter that is currently circling the moon.""A grant of Rs 3 crore is also there for development of the products,"" Misra told IANS.Synthetic Aperture Radar or SAR is a special kind of imaging radar technology that can provide extremely accurate high resolution imagery of the terrain through clouds, smoke and dust even in pitch dark conditions. SAR imagery provides much higher resolution than other forms of remote sensing technology such as hyperspectral and multispectral. SAR is a critical technology for strategic reconnaissance and planning as well as for disaster management.According to Misra, winning the challenge in just over a year of floating the company is a major booster.He said L and P band SAR have an advantage over other frequencies (like X band) when it comes to penetration capabilities through rain, clouds, foliage and vegetation in a tropical country like India, and underground penetration capabilities in dry terrain.Continuing further, he said the L band SAR will provide 1 metre resolution, spotlight resolution in Stripmap mode. The current industry standard is 5-10 metre in L band. Misra said both the L and P band will operate simultaneously from a satellite borne SAR. Recently, Sisir Radar successfully developed and tested the world’s highest resolution L-Band SAR fitted on a drone. With 0.2 metre resolution, this is by far the highest L band SAR in the world, he said.","Space sector startup, Sisir Radar Private Ltd has hit success at the prestigious iDEX DefSpace Challenge.

China orders halt to Boeing jet deliveries as trade war with US intensifies,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/china-orders-halt-to-boeing-jet-deliveries-from-as-trade-war-with-us-intensifies/articleshow/120305185.cms,"Representative image/AI generated

Amid the ongoing trade conflict with the United States of America, China has told its airlines not to take any more deliveries of Boeing Co planes, Bloomberg reported. This move follows US President Donald Trump's decision to impose tariffs of up to 145 per cent on Chinese goods.Chinese carriers have also been asked to stop buying aircraft-related equipment and parts from US companies, sources were quoted as saying by the Bloomberg.The order came after China announced retaliatory tariffs of 125 per cent on American goods over the weekend. These new tariffs would more than double the cost of US-made aircraft and parts, making it difficult for Chinese airlines to continue accepting Boeing planes.China is also looking into ways to help airlines that lease Boeing jets and are now facing higher expenses due to the tariffs, the Bloomberg report said, quoting sources.The trade conflict between the US and China has placed Boeing in a difficult position. The situation remains uncertain and could change. President Trump has reversed some tariffs in the past, including those on Apple Inc.’s iPhones imported from China.The standoff marks another challenge for Boeing in one of the largest markets for aircraft sales.China is expected to account for 20 per cent of global aircraft demand over the next 20 years. In 2018, almost 25 per cent of Boeing’s aircraft were delivered to China, the Bloomberg report said. However, Boeing has not announced any major new orders from China in recent years, mainly because of trade tensions and internal problems.China was the first country to ground the 737 Max in 2019 after two fatal crashes. Trade disagreements during both the Trump and Biden administrations have also led China to shift more of its aircraft purchases to Airbus SE, a European manufacturer. In 2024, Boeing faced another issue when a door plug came off during a flight in January, raising further concerns about quality.The situation also shows that China still depends on foreign companies to meet its growing need for passenger aircraft.",China has told its airlines not to take any more deliveries of Boeing Co planes.

Ms Fixit: TCS's Aarthi Subramanian becomes Indian IT's first woman COO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/tcss-new-coo-aarthi-breaks-it-glass-ceiling/articleshow/120294128.cms,"Aarthi Subramanian

BENGALURU/MUBAI: TCS has appointed Aarthi Subramanian as its president and COO, overseeing operations of the $30 billion IT firm. This appointment marks a significant milestone as she becomes the first woman COO in the Indian IT sector, where gender diversity at the top is woefully skewed.She started as a graduate trainee in TCS in 1989 and rose in ranks to earn the moniker ""Ms Fixit"". She became a dependable troubleshooter to rely upon due to her expertise in delivery excellence, account stewardship, and large-scale programme management. Subramanian later took charge as the head of governance, compliance, and risk management in 2014 and oversaw HR and legal compliances and internal controls at TCS. Before her role as the global head of delivery excellence, she served as the head of delivery for seven years within the TCS retail and consumer packaged goods business unit, where she oversaw many strategic accounts. She was instrumental in setting up the SAP Centre of Excellence in Chennai and drove business excellence, front-ending many customer visits along with the CTO's office.TCS has expanded its executive framework by bringing in Subramanian from Tata Sons, where she was the group chief digital officer for eight years, driving digital technology, innovation, and AI at the group.“The firm is implementing a contextual reset to remain relevant and connected with customers in an AI-driven world, and Aarthi is the right candidate,” said an industry source. A Tata Group insider described Subramanian as a ""very good professional"" who commands significant respect within the Tata Group’s ecosystem. She is also a confidante of Tata Sons chairman N Chandrasekaran—both having worked together in TCS and later at Tata Sons—and has his ear, the source told TOI.In 2017, she was appointed chief digital officer of Tata Sons, transitioning from an executive director of TCS to a non-executive director of the software services company. She also represented Tata Sons—the principal investment company and promoter of Tata enterprises—on the boards of Tata Capital, Tata AIA Life Insurance, Infiniti Retail (Croma), and Tata Electronics. From May 1, the 58-year-old leader will assume the COO position at TCS, moving from non-executive to executive director. This role change requires her to step down from her board positions at Tata Capital, Tata AIA Life Insurance, Infiniti Retail, and Tata Electronics, giving her more time to concentrate on improving TCS' delivery capabilities.Indian IT firms have had few women executives as presidents of business divisions. Subramanian is the pioneering executive to assume this leadership role. In fact, the role was vacant after its former COO N Ganapathy Subramaniam retired from the firm last year after being with the firm for four decades. “I think it’s a very astute appointment and a powerful statement across the Indian tech industry to elevate more women into leadership roles. My view on succession is that she is now on a platform to demonstrate her leadership qualities,” said Phil Fersht, CEO of US-based IT advisory HfS Research. “Indian-heritage IT services firms have been paying lip service to gender diversity, so this is the first major step in the right direction for the industry and a real example for the other firms to follow.”TCS CEO K Krithivasan, in the earnings presser, said, “She knows TCS quite well. She was part of the TCS board while also serves as the chief digital officer of Tata Group. She brings extensive experience regarding how the business has performed and how it has adopted technology.” Her COO tenure concludes in 2030 when she reaches 63. The incumbent CEO Krithivasan will retire in 2029 when he turns 65, adhering to the company's retirement policy for managing directors and executive directors.It's premature to predict what the board of TCS will determine in 2029—whether to elevate Subramanian to the managing director's position or designate a new candidate to succeed Krithivasan. Subramanian is an alumnus of the National Institute of Technology, Warangal, and holds a master’s degree in engineering management from the University of Kansas.",TCS has appointed Aarthi Subramanian as its president and COO.

Delhi IGI Airport T2 to shut for repairs from April 15; flights to shift to T1,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/igi-airport-t2-to-shut-for-repairs-from-tomorrow-flights-to-shift-to-t1/articleshow/120272573.cms,"IGI Airport (File photo)

NEW DELHI: Terminal 2 of Delhi Airport will be shut for repairs on April 15 for about four months and Terminal 1 will finally start operating at 100% capacity. Airlines operating flights from this all-domestic terminal will shift to T1. These include IndiGo and Akasa among others.In a statement, IndiGo said "" effective April 15, 2025, all its flights arriving to and departing from Terminal 2 will operate to/from Terminal 1. With implementation of this change, IndiGo will now operate from Terminal 1 and Terminal 3 of Indira Gandhi International Airport, New Delhi.""IndiGo says it has ""taken proactive measures to ensure that its customers are well-informed about this change. The airline is reaching out to all passengers and their respective travel agents through SMS, calls, and emails to notify them. IndiGo recommends retrieving PNR on the airline's website or mobile app to check departure / arrival terminal before heading to the airport.""Akasa said: ""Starting April 15, 2025, all our flights to and from Delhi will operate from Terminal 1 (1D) of Indira Gandhi International Airport, Delhi.Please your check your flight status before proceeding to the airport.""Delhi Airport said: ""Attention Passengers: Effective April 15, 2025 (0001 hrs), all flights currently operating from Terminal 2 will shift to Terminal 1 until further notice.""Delhi International Airport Ltd (DIAL) has begun conducting trials for transferring check-in baggage of connecting passengers between T3 (IGIA’s only international terminal) and the all domestic T1. This week T1 will get fully operational and then T2 will be shut for repairs. However with an air train still a few years away, transfers between T3 & T1 — at a time when connecting traffic is on the rise thanks to massive network expansion by Air India group and IndiGo — remain a major pain point for passengers. To make domestic-international or vice versa transfers between T3 & T1 little less painful, DIAL plans to ensure baggage of some connecting passengers gets transferred on the airside without them being required to carry the same with them on buses.As of now, international arrivals at Delhi airport have to complete their immigration and customs clearance have to check-in baggage again for connecting flights. “DIAL is conducting trials for smooth transfer of cabin baggage from T3 to T1 for passengers arriving from international destinations and having a connecting flight from T1,” DIAL CEO Videh Kumar Jaipuriar said last Friday. Jaipuriar said once the new system is implemented, then, after customs clearance, passengers will not have to carry baggage to T1. They can drop the baggage at T3, and the airline concerned will transfer it to T1 through the airside, Jaipuriar said.DIAL has told the civil aviation ministry that transfer of passengers for connecting flights from T1 to T3 will be completed in 120 minutes. The number of transfer traffic is expected to rise and with the 7-km apart T1 & T3 not connected by an air train, smooth connections are a distant dream as of now. “We have committed to Govt that it will be ensured passengers coming out of T1 can board a flight in T3 in 120 minutes,” he said.",Terminal 2 of Delhi Airport will be shut for repairs on April 15 for about four months.

Nifty on the NSE also rose sharply, closing 500 points (2.2%) higher at 23,329 points, just three points off its April 2 close.On that day, US President Donald Trump announced new tariff rates for almost all of America’s trading partners. A global market turmoil followed as investors feared retaliations by those countries affected by the new tariff rates, which they thought could lead to a global economic recession.After a week of turmoil, Trump suspended the implementation of most of the new tariffs, scaled back some, or exempted some items from them. However, new tariff rates on China continue.Since volatility in global markets has abated in the last few days, foreign investors are returning to buy stocks in relatively riskier markets like India, market players said. On Tuesday, net buying by foreign funds in domestic stocks was worth Rs 6,066 crore, while domestic funds were net sellers at Rs 1,952 crore.According to Ajit Mishra of Religare Broking, Tuesday’s rally was mainly driven by optimism around the deferral of tariffs and the recent exemptions on select products, “raising hopes for potential negotiations that could ease the overall impact on global trade”. It was also supported by positive global cues. “Adding to the bullish sentiment, the sharp 20% decline in India VIX is a positive sign,” Mishra said.The day’s rally was also aided by a strengthening rupee, which closed 27 paise up at 85.77 to a dollar, from 86.04 in the previous session.Among sensex stocks, Tata Motors closed 4.5% up on the back of talks that the automobile sector may get some relief from the imposition of tariffs by the US.A host of banking stocks gained after most of the leading banks cut deposit rates following a rate cut by RBI last week.

1. GDP growth surpasses expectations

2. Industrial output shows strongest growth since 2021

3. Retail sales jump on stimulus support

4. Fixed-asset investment rises, property sector declines

5. Unemployment rate drops slightly

6. Policymakers signal more stimulus ahead

7. Tariffs cast shadow over growth outlook

8. Export rush in March likely to reverse

9. Economists downgrade 2025 growth forecasts

10. Markets and Yuan largely unmoved by data

China's economy posted stronger-than-expected growth in the first quarter of 2025, offering a temporary boost before the full impact of newly imposed US tariffs begins to bite. According to data released Wednesday by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), gross domestic product rose 5.4% year-on-year in the first three months—above the 5.2% consensus forecast from economists surveyed by Bloomberg.But the celebratory tone is already fading. The data reflects conditions before April, when US President Donald Trump dramatically raised tariffs on Chinese imports, triggering retaliation from Beijing. With levies now as high as 145%, economists warn that China’s growth engine—exports—may stall, increasing pressure on policymakers to step in with stimulus.China’s economy expanded 5.4% in the first quarter compared to the same period a year ago. That performance exceeded both Bloomberg and Reuters forecasts and matched Q4’s pace. However, analysts say this resilience was largely front-loaded. ""Before the tariff storms hit, China's GDP growth likely eased but remained solid, thanks to the recovery in domestic demand,"" Societe Generale analysts noted.March industrial production rose 7.7% year-on-year, the fastest since June 2021.The surge is attributed to factories racing to fulfill overseas orders ahead of tariff hikes. “Industrial production was a beat but understandable after the strong export data. But that’s all in the past now,” said Michelle Lam, Greater China economist at Societe Generale.Retail sales climbed 5.9% in March, the best showing since December 2023 and well above expectations. “The most pleasant surprise is retail sales which shows that consumption subsidies are working,” Lam added. However, weak labor market confidence continues to constrain spending potential, especially as trade tensions weigh on job stability.Fixed-asset investment rose 4.2% in the first quarter, showing steady growth in infrastructure and manufacturing. But property investment fell sharply by 9.9%, reflecting ongoing distress in China’s real estate sector. The prolonged slump in housing continues to drag on broader economic momentum.China’s urban jobless rate fell to 5.2% in March from 5.4% in February. While the drop signals some improvement, analysts say the job market remains fragile and could deteriorate as export-oriented industries face shrinking orders.The NBS acknowledged the mounting risks in its statement: “The external environment is becoming more complex and severe... and the foundation for sustained economic recovery and growth is yet to be consolidated.” Economists expect rate cuts, lower bank reserve requirements, and trillions in fiscal stimulus in the coming months.The upbeat Q1 figures mask what analysts expect to be a sharp slowdown in the months ahead. Trump’s new tariff package lifted duties on most Chinese goods to 145%, triggering tit-for-tat retaliation by Beijing. “We think the tariff shock poses unprecedented challenges to China’s exports,” UBS analysts wrote in a recent downgrade of their growth forecast.March's export surge was seen as a temporary spike, driven by firms rushing to ship goods before tariffs hit. With levies now active, April and May are likely to show a sharp pullback. “Trade activities have likely slowed rapidly this month as global companies paused orders and reduced production,” analysts warned.UBS cut its 2025 growth forecast for China to 3.4% from 4%, while Goldman Sachs and Citigroup have also issued downward revisions. Without major stimulus, Beijing could miss its 5% growth target for the year. The tariff shock has amplified pre-existing weaknesses, including sluggish demand and rising debt.Despite the better-than-expected data, Chinese stocks remained under pressure. The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index fell as much as 2.4%, while the CSI 300 dropped 0.8%. The yuan held steady at 7.3236 in offshore trading, reflecting muted investor optimism amid geopolitical tensions and economic uncertainty.(With inputs from agencies)","China's economy posted stronger-than-expected growth in the first quarter of 2025.

A federal judge has ordered Bank of America to pay $540.3 million to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) in a long-standing legal battle over underpaid deposit insurance assessments. The ruling, made public on Monday, stems from assessments owed between the second quarter of 2013 and the end of 2014, and includes accrued interest.According to Reuters, the lawsuit dates back to 2017, when the FDIC sued the Charlotte, North Carolina-based lender for $1.12 billion. The complaint alleged that Bank of America failed to comply with a 2011 federal rule that altered how banks report their exposure to counterparty risks—a regulation introduced as part of broader reforms to safeguard the US banking system following the 2008 financial crisis.In her 59-page ruling, US District Judge Loren AliKhan in Washington, DC, dismissed Bank of America's argument that the FDIC’s actions were arbitrary and lacked a reasonable basis. She emphasized that the FDIC was not required to develop a flawless metric for measuring potential losses and noted that Bank of America could not claim it lacked sufficient notice regarding its obligations.However, Judge AliKhan also determined that the FDIC had waited too long to pursue claims related to periods before the second quarter of 2013.Bank of America has strongly denied any intention of evading payments. In a statement to Reuters, spokesperson Bill Halldin said, “We are pleased the judge has ruled and have reserves reflecting the decision.”The FDIC declined to comment on the ruling. Judge AliKhan issued the decision on March 31, releasing a partially redacted version to the public.Bank of America, the second-largest US bank, is scheduled to report its first-quarter earnings on Tuesday. The case is FDIC v.

US stocks opened higher on Tuesday morning as markets showed signs of stabilizing after recent volatility driven by trade tensions. The S&P 500 rose 0.5% in early trading, though market activity remained choppy, reflecting ongoing uncertainty around US President Donald Trump’s trade war — a conflict that economists warn could trigger a global recession if not de-escalated.As of 1:50 PM EDT on April 15, US markets showed a mixed performance. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 24.47 points, or 0.06%, to 40,500.32. The Nasdaq Composite edged down 0.87 points, or 0.01%, to 16,830.61, while the S&P 500 managed a slight gain of 1.22 points, or 0.02%, to reach 5,407.19.Gold prices rose sharply, gaining $17 or 0.53%, to trade at $3,243.30 per ounce, as investors continued to seek safety in the precious metal amid global uncertainty. Oil, however, moved lower, with US crude slipping 0.24 cents, or 0.39%, to $61.29 per barrel on concerns about demand outlook.The bond market showed signs of stability, with the yield on the US 10-year Treasury note falling 4.8 basis points to 4.316%, indicating easing investor concerns. Meanwhile, the dollar weakened against major currencies, as the euro rose to 1.128, pushing the EUR/USD pair up by 0.67%.Market volatility also declined, with the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) down 4.4% at 29.53, signalling a modest reduction in investor anxiety.On Wall Street , bank stocks led gains. Bank of America surged 3.5% after reporting quarterly earnings that beat analysts' estimates. Citigroup also exceeded expectations, sending its shares up 2.3%. Analysts said the strong performance from major banks was driven in part by trading desks capitalizing on market volatility caused by shifting US trade policy, as per AP reports.Palantir Technologies rose 3.7%, extending its rally after Nato announced plans to use the company’s artificial intelligence tools in its allied command operations.However, not all sectors fared well. Albertsons fell 7% despite posting better-than-expected profits for the quarter. The parent company of Safeway and Vons issued a forecast for the upcoming year that fell short of analysts’ expectations.DaVita, a health care provider, declined 1.8% following a ransomware attack that has disrupted some of its operations. The company said it is still assessing the full scope and impact of the incident, which it discovered on Saturday.Boeing shares also weighed on the market, dropping 2% after a Bloomberg report said that China had ordered its airlines to suspend further deliveries of Boeing aircraft and to halt purchases of aircraft equipment from US companies.Earlier, Wall Street veered toward modest losses in early Tuesday trading, showing limited reaction to President Donald Trump’s latest softening of tariffs, while relief from recent bond market stress helped maintain a relatively calm tone. Futures for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq each dipped 0.3%, while Dow Jones Industrial Average futures were down 0.4%.Despite the easing on some trade measures, the Trump administration simultaneously signalled potential new tariffs, launching an investigation into the national security risks of importing pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, and related tech products.“You know the drill: one step forward, two steps back, then a whiplash pivot into carrot-and-stick diplomacy. It’s becoming the signature of this White House — deliver a policy gut punch, then soften the blow with selective reprieves or 90-day pauses.

Major US banks have generally reported strong first-quarter earnings, thanks in part to active trading desks capitalizing on volatility from the administration’s fluctuating tariff strategy.Johnson & Johnson also posted solid quarterly results, but its shares were down 1% before Tuesday’s opening bell.Boeing shares tumbled 3.3% following a Bloomberg report that Chinese regulators have instructed airlines to stop taking deliveries of Boeing aircraft and to suspend procurement of aviation equipment from US firms.United Airlines is expected to report earnings after market close.Meanwhile, Treasury yields steadied after a volatile surge last week.

Strong domestic fundamentals

Investor outlook improved

India seen as resilient amid global trade risks

NEW DELHI: Indian equities surged as markets reopened after an extended weekend, with the NSE Nifty 50 Index rallying by as much as 2.4% on Tuesday in Mumbai, surpassing its April 2 closing level. According to Bloomberg, this rebound makes India the first major market globally to erase losses stemming from the reciprocal tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump earlier this month.While a broader index of Asian stocks remains down over 3% since the tariff announcements, India’s swift recovery has underscored its growing perception as a relative safe haven amid ongoing global market volatility , as per the Bloomberg report.Investors continue to view India’s large domestic-driven economy as better equipped to weather a potential global slowdown compared to peers more directly exposed to US tariffs. The escalating US-China trade war has further positioned India as an attractive alternative for global manufacturing, with India maintaining a conciliatory approach and working toward a provisional trade agreement with Washington, in contrast to Beijing’s retaliatory stance.ALSO READ: Indian and American trade delegations to begin discussions on a bilateral trade agreement this week “We remain overweight India in our portfolios,” said Gary Dugan, CEO of The Global CIO Office. “Supported by good domestic growth and aided by a likely diversification of supply chains away from China, Indian equities are seen as a safer bet over the medium term,” he told Bloomberg.India’s sharp rebound follows a nearly 10% slump in the Nifty 50 over the past two quarters, triggered by slowing economic growth, steep valuations, and continued foreign investor outflows. So far this year, overseas investors have sold more than $16 billion in Indian equities on a net basis, close to the record $17 billion withdrawn in 2022.ALSO READ | Sensex, Nifty surge over 2%: 5 reasons behind market rally Still, improving investor sentiment is being supported by relatively lower stock valuations, expectations of aggressive rate cuts by the Reserve Bank of India, and declining crude oil prices — a major positive for India’s import-heavy economy.As per Bloomberg data, the Nifty 50 is currently trading at 18.5 times its projected 12-month earnings, compared to a five-year average of 19.5 and a peak multiple of 21 in late September.“India is not insulated, but relatively better positioned amid the risk of a trade war given its low direct revenue exposure to US, particularly on the goods side,” said Rajat Agarwal, strategist at Societe Generale SA. “Indian equities should also benefit if oil prices sustain at low levels.”Data compiled by Bloomberg shows India accounted for just 2.7% of total US imports last year, far lower than China’s 14% and Mexico’s 15%.","NSE Nifty 50 Index rallied by as much as 2.4% on Tuesday in Mumbai, surpassing its April 2 closing level.

“China exposed the truth”

“How we bypass tariffs,”

US TikTok users are increasingly encountering a surge of videos from Chinese content creators encouraging Americans to purchase goods directly from Chinese factories—an apparent strategy to sidestep the Trump administration’s tariffs.These viral clips, often filmed at manufacturing facilities purportedly producing for major US brands like Lululemon Athletica Inc. and Nike Inc., emphasize the Chinese origin of many consumer products. “Why don’t you just contact us and buy directly? You won’t believe the prices we offer,” says one creator in a video promoting luxury handbags, according to Bloomberg.In a widely circulated clip, TikTok user @LunaSourcingChina showcases a factory she claims produces Lululemon yoga leggings for just $5 to $6, compared to retail prices exceeding $100 in the US. “The material and craftsmanship are basically the same,” she asserts.Lululemon has since responded, clarifying that only about 3% of its finished goods are made in Mainland China and stressing that authentic Lululemon products are sold exclusively through its official channels and partners.Although many of these videos were uploaded as early as March, they’ve recently gained significant traction amid heightened US-China trade tensions A video titledhas amassed 8.3 million views and 492,000 likes. The clip allegedly exposing a Lululemon supplier drew 2.6 million views and over 215,000 likes, while another, titledneared 1 million views and 118,000 likes.Alex Goldenberg, senior intelligence analyst at the Network Contagion Research Institute at Rutgers University, views the trend as a deliberate push to weaken President Trump’s tariff policies and elevate Chinese manufacturing via TikTok’s powerful algorithm.While the actual legal mechanics of tariff avoidance through direct-to-consumer purchasing remain murky—especially with the small-parcel duty exemption set to expire May 2—the phenomenon raises questions about tariff efficacy and the broader impact on American consumers.Currently, Chinese goods are subject to a cumulative tariff rate of 145%. Although Trump has temporarily suspended additional tariffs on select nations for 90 days, China is not among them.These viral TikTok posts also spotlight growing concerns about the influence of Chinese creators on American audiences and the opaque nature of content distribution on the platform. These worries are fueling ongoing efforts in Washington to force a separation between TikTok’s Chinese parent company, ByteDance Ltd., and its global operations.Beyond trade policy, the videos may carry legal consequences. Some observers believe factory disclosures may violate NDAs with global brands and jeopardize supplier relationships, as per Bloomberg reports.Cameron Johnson, senior partner at Tidalwave Solutions, interprets the trend as part of a broader global sourcing shift—from traditional retail intermediaries to factory-direct models—potentially reshaping how Americans shop and how brands protect their supply chains.",Videos from Chinese content creators are encouraging Americans to purchase goods directly from Chinese factories.

Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

NEW YORK: Sam Bankman-Fried , testifying in his own defense at his fraud trial on Friday, acknowledged that a ""lot of people got hurt"" when the FTX cryptocurrency exchange he founded collapsed, but said he did not defraud anyone or take customer funds.Shortly after taking the witness stand in Manhattan federal court, Bankman-Fried said he made ""a number of small mistakes and a number of larger mistakes"" while running the now-bankrupt exchange. The biggest mistake, he said, was not implementing a dedicated risk management team.""We thought that we might be able to build the best product on the market,"" Bankman-Fried said. ""It turned out basically the opposite of that. A lot of people got hurt - customers, employees - and the company ended up in bankruptcy.""Prosecutors accuse Bankman-Fried of using FTX customer funds to prop up his crypto-focused hedge fund, Alameda Research, make speculative venture investments and donate more than $100 million to US political campaigns. He also faces charges of scheming to cheat Alameda's lenders and FTX investors.He has pleaded not guiltyBankman-Fried's trial, which began on October 3, is drawing to a close nearly a year after FTX collapsed amid a wave of customer withdrawals. The company declared bankruptcy in November 2022 and Bankman-Fried was indicted the following month.His testimony marked the first time the dozen jurors and five alternates have heard directly from the 31-year-old former billionaire after 12 trial days.Bankman-Fried, who was jailed in August after US District Judge Lewis Kaplan found he likely tampered with witnesses, wore a suit and spoke with two water bottles placed in front of him on the witness stand. The former mogul once known for wearing shorts and T-shirts and sporting an unkempt mop of curly locks cut his hair before his trial began.Responding to questions posed by his defense lawyer Mark Cohen, Bankman-Fried spoke in calm, measured tones during the first portion of his testimony as he recounted founding Alameda in 2017, shortly after graduating from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, despite knowing little about crypto.But Bankman-Fried - who had studied physics and worked as a quantitative trader at Jane Street - said he saw opportunities for ""arbitrage"" in the market for digital assets. He said Alameda's first office was in a small Airbnb in Berkeley, California, before he later moved the firm to Hong Kong.""We wanted to be under the radar at that point in time,"" he said on the stand, adding he named the hedge fund after the California county where it was founded in part so competitors would not discover what they were doing.Jurors have heard from three of his closest confidantes at FTX and Alameda, all of whom have pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors. They testified earlier this month that they committed financial crimes at Bankman-Fried's behest.For criminal defendants, taking the stand is a risky proposition because it opens them up to potentially probing cross-examination by prosecutors.But given Bankman-Fried's penchant for risk, legal experts say he likely viewed taking the stand as his best shot to counter the allegations made by members of his inner circle, which were backed up by spreadsheets the three said demonstrated how customer funds were stolen and text messages in which they discussed FTX's shortfall of funds with Bankman-Fried.","Sam Bankman-Fried says he made ""a number of small mistakes and a number of larger mistakes"" while running the now-bankrupt exchange.

"Crypto isn’t dead, it’s evolving rapidly to create a new world",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/cryptocurrency/crypto-isnt-dead-its-evolving-rapidly-to-create-a-new-world/articleshow/101324954.cms,"Regulatory landscape



There are few technologies as confusing to most people as crypto and blockchain. The tech and regulations underpinning it are evolving so rapidly, it is difficult for even technologists to often make sense of it.Crypto assets and crypto currencies are based on blockchain tech, which is a form of distributed ledger technology that stores data on thousands of data servers around the world, as opposed to today where data is stored only in one place or clustered in a few locations. This data is open, meaning it can be viewed and verified by anyone taking part in that particular system. What this means practically is that an individual can transfer crypto assets without the help of intermediaries, say, banks or government agencies, thereby ensuring privacy, speed and lower costs.The first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin , was created with anonymity in mind, it was a way for people to conduct financial transactions away from the prying eyes of governments. While it went on to become a speculative asset, today, crypto, and the underlying blockchain technology, has a far more ambitious goal – the transformation of the internet.CoinDCX CTO Vivek Gupta says this technology can help usher in Web 3. 0 – a decentralised form of the internet where users can actually monetise their time spent online. “Whatever Web3 use case you may be driving, the value that comes from it must be distributed, and you cannot distribute that without crypto. For something as simple as depositing money in a pool and getting a receipt token, that receipt token is a crypto. That’s the proof that I have deposited the money. Without crypto there is no Web3 use case,” he says.Decentralised finance (DeFi) is a huge part of what makes blockchain tech so disruptive. Imagine being able to lend your money to strangers on the internet and get paid an interest. Or imagine spending time on socialmedia platforms or playing video games and getting paid for your time spent by someone who needs data about you. Web3 makes this possible because the data isn’t controlled by any one company or country.Decentralised apps (dApps) are another Web3 feature. Unlike traditional apps hosted on centralised servers, dApps operate on a peer-to-peer network and utilisethe consensus mechanism and transparency features of blockchain technology.“I see a big disruption coming, especially in the DeFi tokenisation space and the whole content creator economy,” says Ravi Chamria, co-founder & CEO of Zeeve, a blockchain automation platform.Ashish Singhal, co-founder & CEO of CoinSwitch, says the tech can revolutionise how we conduct business, store data, and even vote, since the tech allows people to verify data of any kind efficiently.Governments are worried about what crypto could mean for monetary policy, for their ability to regulate people’s lives. But disruption hardly ever requires consensus. If a new technology proves to be better than an old one, people will drift towards it.Central banks have recognised the importance of the technology and some are creating Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) that are based on blockchain technology. “There’s a lot of activity happening in the regulated DeFi space. Looking at the future, we think guardrails are probably a good thing to have around these sorts of technologies,” says Andrew Vranjes, VP of sales at Blockdaemon, a blockchain infrastructure platform.Cryptocurrencies too are rapidly changing. Where before the value of cryptocurrencies were based on what people were willing to pay for them, today there are crypto assets that are backed by real world assets like equity and real estate. Silvina Moschini’s Unicoin is one of them. “It is an assets backed, audited, SEC-compliant cryptocurrency,” she says.","Crypto assets and crypto currencies are based on blockchain tech, which is a form of distributed ledger technology that stores data on thousands of data servers around the world.

"US tightens crackdown on crypto with lawsuits against Coinbase, Binance",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/cryptocurrency/bitcoin/us-tightens-crackdown-on-crypto-with-lawsuits-against-coinbase-binance/articleshow/100810119.cms,"BROKER, EXCHANGE CRACKDOWN



NEW YORK: The top U.S. securities regulator sued cryptocurrency platform Coinbase on Tuesday, the second lawsuit in two days against a major crypto exchange, in a dramatic escalation of a crackdown on the industry and one that could dramatically transform a market that has largely operated outside regulation.The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Monday took aim at Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange. The SEC accuses Binance and its CEO Changpeng Zhao of operating a ""web of deception"".If successful, the lawsuits could transform the crypto market by successfully asserting the SEC's jurisdiction over the industry which for years has argued that tokens do not constitute securities and should not be regulated by the SEC.""The two cases are different, but overlap and point in the same direction: the SEC's increasingly aggressive campaign to bring cryptocurrencies under the jurisdiction of the federal securities laws,"" said Kevin O'Brien, a partner at Ford O'Brien Landy and a former federal prosecutor, adding, however, that the SEC has not previously taken on such major crypto players.""If the SEC prevails in either case, the cryptocurrency industry will be transformed.""In its complaint filed in Manhattan federal court, the SEC said Coinbase has since at least 2019 made billions of dollars by operating as a middleman on crypto transactions, while evading disclosure requirements meant to protect investors.The SEC said Coinbase traded at least 13 crypto assets that are securities that should have been registered, including tokens such as Solana, Cardano and Polygon.Coinbase suffered about $1.28 billion of net customer outflows following the lawsuit, according to initial estimates from data firm Nansen. Shares of Coinbase's parent Coinbase Global Inc closed down $7.10, or 12.1%, at $51.61 after earlier falling as much as 20.9%. They are up 46% this year.Paul Grewal, Coinbase's general counsel, in a statement said the company will continue operating as usual and has ""demonstrated commitment to compliance.""Oanda senior market analyst Ed Moya said the SEC ""looks like it's playing Whac-A-Mole with crypto exchanges,"" and because most exchanges offer a range of tokens that operate on blockchain protocols targeted by regulators, ""it seems like this is just the beginning.""Leading cryptocurrency bitcoin has been a paradoxical beneficiary of the crackdown.After an initial plunge to a nearly three-month low of $25,350 following the Binance suit, bitcoin rebounded by more than $2,000, exceeding the previous day's high. It was trading just below $27,000 at 0410 GMT.""The SEC is making life nearly impossible for several altcoins and that is actually driving some crypto traders back into bitcoin,"" explained Oanda's Moya.Securities, as opposed to other assets such as commodities, are strictly regulated and require detailed disclosures to inform investors of potential risks. The Securities Act of 1933 outlined a definition of the term ""security,"" yet many experts rely on two U.S. Supreme Court cases to determine if an investment product constitutes a security.SEC Chair Gary Gensler has long said tokens constitute securities and has steadily asserted its authority over the crypto market, focusing initially on the sale of tokens and interest-bearing crypto products. More recently, it has taken aim at unregistered crypto broker dealer, exchange trading and clearing activity.While a few crypto companies are licensed as alternative system trading systems, a type of trading platform used by brokers to trade listed securities, no crypto platform operates as a full-blown stock exchange. The SEC also this year sued Beaxy Digital and Bittrex Global for failing to register as an exchange, clearing house and broker.""The whole business model is built on a noncompliance with the U.S. securities laws and we're asking them to come into compliance,"" Gensler told CNBC.Crypto companies refute that tokens meet the definition of a security, say the SEC's rules are ambiguous, and that the SEC is overstepping its authority in trying to regulate them. Still, many companies have boosted compliance, shelved products and expanded outside the country in response to the crackdown.Kristin Smith, CEO of the Blockchain Association trade group, rejected Gensler's efforts to oversee the industry.""We're confident the courts will prove Chair Gensler wrong in due time,"" she said.Founded in 2012, Coinbase recently served more than 108 million customers and ended March with $130 billion of customer crypto assets and funds on its balance sheet. Transactions generated 75% of its $3.15 billion of net revenue last year.Tuesday's SEC lawsuit seeks civil fines, the recouping of ill-gotten gains and injunctive relief.On Monday, the SEC accused Binance of inflating trading volumes, diverting customer funds, improperly commingling assets, failing to restrict U.S. customers from its platform, and misleading customers about its controls.Binance pledged to vigorously defend itself against the lawsuit, which it said reflected the SEC's ""misguided and conscious refusal"" to provide clarity to the crypto industry.Customers pulled around $790 million from Binance and its U.S. affiliate following the lawsuit, Nansen said.On Tuesday, the SEC filed a motion to freeze assets belonging to Binance.US, Binance's U.S. affiliate. The holding company of Binance is based in the Cayman Islands.""It's important to note that recent regulatory actions are aimed at ensuring that companies operating in the cryptocurrency industry are complying with securities laws and protecting investors - this will always be their goal,"" said Joshua Chu, group chief risk officer at blockchain technology firms XBE, Coinllectibles and Marvion.""These events will ultimately lead to a more stable and trustworthy industry, which could help to attract more institutional investors and mainstream adoption.""","The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Monday took aim at Binance.

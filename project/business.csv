"Service charge row: CCPA cracks down on 27 restaurants for mandatory levy; refunds, penalties ordered",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/service-charge-row-ccpa-cracks-down-on-27-restaurants-for-mandatory-levy-refunds-penalties-ordered/articleshow/126453907.cms,"The Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA) on Saturday said it has taken suo motu action against 27 restaurants across the country for mandatorily levying service charges on customers, holding the practice to be a violation of consumer law.The restaurants have been fined up to Rs 50,000, directed to refund the service charge collected from consumers, and asked to modify their billing systems to remove any default addition of such charges, the authority said.According to the Department of Consumer Affairs, the CCPA took “suo motu cognizance against 27 restaurants located across the country for violation of consumer rights and adoption of unfair trade practices under Section 2(47) of the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, relating to the mandatory levy of service charge”.The action followed complaints received on the National Consumer Helpline (NCH), supported by invoices showing that a 10 per cent service charge was being added automatically to bills.Investigations found that several establishments, including Café Blue Bottle, Patna, and China Gate Restaurant Pvt Ltd (Bora Bora), Mumbai, were levying service charges by default — a practice declared an unfair trade practice under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, and barred under CCPA guidelines.In the case of Café Blue Bottle, Patna, the CCPA directed the restaurant to refund the entire service charge collected from the complainant, discontinue the practice with immediate effect, and pay a penalty of Rs 30,000.In the case of China Gate Restaurant Pvt Ltd (Bora Bora), Mumbai, the restaurant refunded the service charge during the hearing. It was further directed to modify its software-generated billing system to remove the default levy and pay a penalty of Rs 50,000.The CCPA said it is “closely monitoring complaints received on the National Consumer Helpline regarding levy of service charge and will continue to take strict action against non-compliant restaurants to safeguard consumer rights and prevent unfair trade practices”.The action comes after the Delhi High Court’s March 2025 ruling, which upheld the CCPA’s guidelines on service charges and held that mandatory collection of service charge by restaurants is contrary to law. The court also affirmed that the CCPA is fully empowered to enforce its guidelines.The Guidelines to Prevent Unfair Trade Practices and Protection of Consumer Interest with Regard to Levy of Service Charge in Hotels and Restaurants, issued on July 4, 2022, clearly state that restaurants cannot add a service charge automatically or by default, cannot collect it under any other name, and cannot force consumers to pay it. The guidelines also bar restaurants from denying entry or service to customers who refuse to pay a service charge.","The Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA) has taken suo motu action against 27 restaurants across the country. The restaurants have been fined up to Rs 50,000, directed to refund the service charge collected from consumers, and asked to modify their billing systems to remove any default addition of such charges.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126453974,imgsize-519423,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"
EU–Mercosur trade deal row: Why are Irish farmers protesting against the pact; what’s at stake,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/eumercosur-trade-deal-row-why-are-irish-farmers-protesting-against-the-pact-whats-at-stake/articleshow/126453316.cms,"File photo- Protestors burn tires during a demonstration of European farmers outside the EU Summit meeting in Brussels.

Why farmers are protesting



Several thousand Irish farmers took to the streets of central Ireland on Saturday to protest the European Union’s trade agreement with the South American bloc Mercosur, a day after EU member states approved the deal despite opposition from Ireland and France, according to AFP.Tractors converged on the town of Athlone, with farmers holding placards reading “Stop EU-Mercosur” and banners depicting the European Union flag marked with the words “sell out”. The protest formed part of wider demonstrations across Europe, with farmers marching in Poland and blocking roads in France and Belgium on Friday as the deal received political clearance.The EU–Mercosur agreement, negotiated over more than 25 years, aims to create one of the world’s largest free-trade areas, linking the 27-nation EU with Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay. Under the pact, Mercosur would gain greater access to EU markets for agricultural products and minerals, while European exporters would benefit from lower tariffs on machinery, chemicals and pharmaceuticals.Irish farmers say the deal threatens to undercut domestic agriculture by opening the door to large volumes of cheaper imports, particularly beef, from South America. The agreement is opposed by farm groups over concerns that an additional 99,000 tonnes of low-cost beef could enter the EU market, putting pressure on prices and farm incomes in Ireland.These concerns prompted Ireland, France, Poland, Hungary and Austria to vote against the accord at the EU level.The Irish Farmers’ Association (IFA), the country’s main farming lobby, described the approval of the deal as “very disappointing” and said it would intensify efforts to block the agreement in the European Parliament.“We expect Irish MEPs to stand behind the farming community and reject the Mercosur deal,” IFA president Francie Gorman said in a statement.Although EU governments have approved the pact, it still requires backing from a majority of Members of the European Parliament in the coming months, where shifting alliances could influence the final outcome.","Several thousand Irish farmers took to the streets of central Ireland on Saturday to protest the European Union’s trade agreement with the South American bloc Mercosur.

No tax relief for Flipkart co-founder Binny Bansal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/no-tax-relief-for-flipkart-co-founder-binny-bansal/articleshow/126460626.cms,".

MUMBAI: The Bengaluru bench of Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (ITAT) has dismissed Flipkart co-founder Binny Bansal 's non-resident claim, denying him the benefit of India-Singapore Tax Treaty sought by him. The tribunal passed the final order on Jan 9.In his appeal, Bansal argued that he had gone outside India (Singapore) for employment, and hence should be treated as a person 'being outside India.' Bansal also claimed that he was a resident of Singapore during the financial year 2019-20 and so, capital gains arising from the sale of his Flipkart shares undertaken in Aug 28, 2019 and Nov 27, 2019 are not taxable in India.""...We hold that the assessee (Bansal) has been in India for more than 60 days and satisfied the residential test of provisions not section 6(1) c of the (Income Tax) Act and is not entitled to the relaxation in the period of stay...undisputedly, assessee is an Indian national,"" the tribunal said in its 189-page order. Bansal couldn't be immediately reached for a comment.The tax department contended that relaxations under IT act pertaining to residential status being claimed by Bansal can apply only in case of a person who is already a non-resident and not to an Assessee who was a resident in the immediately preceding year. ""If the stand of the assessee is accepted that for this assessment year [ AY 2020-21 ] also the assessee should get a benefit of extended time period of 182 days instead of 60 days as per the second limb of section 6 (1) ( c ) of the Act, than every person who visits India will get such an extension of period every year,"" the tribunal said.However, it said that in the result, the appeal filed by the assessee is 'partly allowed' which means that the tribunal upheld some of the appellant's arguments.Bansal stepped down from the board of Flipkart in 2024, ending his association with the e-commerce firm he co-founded with Sachin Bansal in 2007.",Bansal argued that he had gone outside India (Singapore) for employment. He also claimed that he was a resident of Singapore during the financial year 2019-20.

Sebi chief hints at nod for NSE IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sebi-chief-hints-at-nod-for-nse-ipo/articleshow/126460596.cms,".

CHENNAI: Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) is likely to clear National Stock Exchange ’s (NSE) longdelayed initial public offering (IPO) soon. Sebi chief Tuhin Kanta Pandey indicated in Chennai on Saturday that the NOC for the public offer could come before the end of this month, signalling a possible end to years of regulatory and legal uncertainty surrounding the listing of the country’s largest stock exchange.NSE has been pursuing regulatory clearance for its IPO for almost a decade, its quest hobbled by governance lapses and a 2015 co-location controversy that drew scrutiny from the market regulator.The exchange had filed its first draft red herring prospectus in 2016, but the IPO process was stalled amid regulatory challenges. In the interim, the exchange reapplied to Sebi for a NOC to revive and move ahead with its long-pending initial public offering.Earlier, addressing a convention organised by the Association of National Exchanges Members of India, Pandey outlined the regulator’s proposed next phase of capital market reforms. At the heart of the roadmap is investor onboarding, with Sebi proposing to further simplify KYC processes for retail participants. Citing survey findings that show a smoother onboarding experience encourages first-time investors, the regulator plans to reduce repeat documentation and streamline re-KYC by ensuring that KYC Registration Agencies (KRAs) retain only updated records, Pandey told the International Capital Market Convention.Another key focus area is facilitating NRI participation. Building on recent relaxations, Sebi will consult stakeholders on creating a secure, end-to-end KYC framework that allows NRIs to complete the process without visiting India, Pandey said.","Sebi is likely to clear National Stock Exchange’s (NSE) longdelayed initial public offering (IPO) soon.

The meeting also saw participation from the Governor of Manipur, chief ministers of Delhi, Goa, Haryana, Jammu and Kashmir, Meghalaya and Sikkim, and deputy chief ministers of several states, including Telangana.Opposition-ruled states said the changes to the rural employment framework weaken the employment guarantee and go against the spirit of cooperative federalism.Parliament last month passed the VB-G RAM G Bill, replacing the two-decade-old Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA). Under the new scheme, the Centre will bear 60 per cent of the cost and states 40 per cent, compared with the 90:10 funding pattern under MGNREGA.Punjab Finance Minister Harpal Singh Cheema strongly opposed the proposed changes, saying the new framework dilutes the employment guarantee while shifting a significant financial burden to states.“Proposed MGNREGA changes weaken employment guarantee and burden states,” Cheema said at the meeting, calling for the restoration of the original demand-driven structure and funding pattern of the scheme.Telangana Finance Minister Mallu Bhatti Vikramarka said the Union government had replaced MGNREGA with VB-G RAM G without consulting states. He noted that the shift from a 90:10 to 60:40 funding ratio would further strain state finances.He also pointed out that any additional man-days beyond the normative allocation would now have to be borne by states, which would create a serious obstacle in providing demand-based work to job seekers.“This is entirely against the spirit of cooperative federalism and starving them of funds for capital outlay, which is essential for maintaining growth momentum,” Vikramarka said.The Telangana finance minister also suggested that surcharges on income tax and corporation tax be credited to a non-lapsable infrastructure fund, from which states could receive grants for infrastructure development. Alternatively, he said, surcharges should be merged with basic tax rates to expand the divisible pool of central taxes.On GST reforms, Vikramarka said GST 2.0 may boost demand but questioned its sustainability, warning that states’ revenues could fall due to rate reductions. He called for a suitable mechanism to compensate states for any revenue loss.Punjab also sought a special fiscal package, citing the “double whammy” of border tensions and floods in 2025. On GST, Cheema said Punjab is facing an annual revenue loss of nearly Rs 6,000 crore following GST 2.0 and pressed for a predictable GST stabilisation or compensation mechanism for states.",Opposition-ruled states Punjab and Telangana on Saturday sought additional fiscal support from the Centre in the Union Budget 2026-27.

He also flagged constraints under the Urban Infrastructure Development Fund (UIDF), arguing that the current Rs 100 crore cap on project size was limiting execution of large urban projects, and proposed that the ceiling be raised to Rs 500 crore.Saini thanked the Centre for continuing the Special Assistance to States for Capital Investment scheme and sought higher untied allocations for Haryana, along with relaxations in utilisation conditions, citing the state’s special requirements due to its location in the National Capital Region (NCR).He said the upcoming Budget would further pave the way for Haryana’s progress and reaffirmed the state’s commitment to contributing towards making India a developed nation by 2047.Highlighting Haryana’s agrarian profile, Saini said the state ranks second in the country in foodgrain production and is known as the breadbasket of India. He said around six lakh acres of land are affected by salinity and waterlogging, and sought central financial assistance to prevent further damage.He also underlined the need for modernising agriculture through digital agriculture, micro-irrigation, agri-logistics and value addition, adding that agri-processing clusters and MSMEs could become engines of rural prosperity.On the social sector, Saini said Haryana plans to open a medical college in every district, for which substantial support under centrally sponsored schemes would be required. He also sought higher assistance for social security pensions, noting that over 44 lakh people in the state receive such benefits.The chief minister said Haryana’s NCR region is being developed as a logistics hub, requiring higher central capital investment to improve connectivity and time-bound movement of goods. Stressing the importance of entrepreneurship, he said Haryana ranks fourth nationally in startups and is setting up a Rs 2,000 crore Fund of Funds to support them.He added that the state is developing 10 new Industrial Model Townships (IMTs) to boost MSMEs and attract investment, for which additional central assistance is needed.Saini also emphasised the importance of human capital, calling for greater focus on education, health and skills, particularly in emerging areas such as artificial intelligence, semiconductors, green technology and biotechnology.","Haryana Chief Minister Nayab Singh Saini urged the Centre to step up allocations for the state’s rural and urban infrastructure, agriculture and allied sectors in the Union Budget for FY27.

India’s Energy Security Strategy

What’s The Road Ahead For India’s Energy Security?

Oil is called black gold - and for a reason - it’s the fuel that drives economic growth and oil security is increasingly becoming crucial in a world fraught with geopolitical uncertainties and possibilities of supply shocks. India imports over 85% of its crude oil needs - and a rise in crude oil prices or uncertainty in supply chains can feed negatively into the economic growth engine.Recent geopolitical tensions - possible blocking of the Strait of Hormuz, US moves in Venezuela which has the highest proven oil reserves in the world, and the Donald Trump administration’s tariffs on India for its crude imports from Russia all highlight the need for India to step up focus on its energy security.An SBI Research report last year - at the time of the Iran-Israel conflict - estimated that every $10 per bbl increase in crude oil prices can lead to 25-35 bps increase in CPI inflation and 20-30 bps decline in real GDP growth. However, SBI expects oil prices to soften this year, which will boost growth. Trump has been pressuring India to stop procuring crude from Russia and has even sanctioned two major Russian firms. A bill proposing 500% tariffs on countries buying Russian oil has also got a nod from the American President and will be put up for a vote in the Senate soon.India’s crude oil import basket has undergone a clear and measurable shift over the past five years, according to data from Kpler, a global real-time data and analytics provider. In 2021, India’s sourcing was still heavily dominated by the Middle East. By 2023, the transformation was clearly visible in the data. Russia became India’s largest crude supplier, accounting for over 38% of total imports.By 2025, data shows early signs of marginal rebalancing. Russia’s share eased to around 35%, while Iraq (19%) and Saudi Arabia (13%) remained steady. Notably, US crude regained visibility with a share of about 6.5%, highlighting India’s continued effort to keep procurement diversified and flexible, especially amid periodic logistical and compliance-related uncertainties in global trade.Post the latest EU sanctions in August, and US tariff and sanction actions linked to Russian entities such as Rosneft and Lukoil, India’s oil procurement strategy has remained pragmatic and interest-driven.“While India continues to acknowledge and factor in global sanctions frameworks, energy security and supply stability remain the primary considerations. Russian crude has continued to form a key part of India’s import basket, although volumes have eased since around December 2025 amid tighter compliance scrutiny, logistical challenges and a conscious effort by refiners to limit concentration risk,” says Sumit Ritolia, Lead Research Analyst, Refining and Modelling, Kpler.With India importing almost over 85% of its crude oil requirements, the dependency on the world is very high. Experts say that energy security is not only vital to India’s economic growth, it is a strategic necessity. Is India insulated from possible global supply shocks?Sumit Ritolia of Kpler cautions that India remains structurally vulnerable to external energy shocks, as nearly nine-tenths of its crude oil requirements are met through imports.“However, the country’s overall energy security framework is stronger today than it was a few years ago,” he tells TOI.Sumit Ritolia explains: India has significantly diversified its crude oil sourcing base across geographies, reducing over-reliance and improving its ability to respond to supply disruptions.“Indian refiners have also enhanced operational flexibility, enabling them to process a wider range of crude grades and swiftly adjust procurement strategies in response to changing market or geopolitical conditions,” he says.Pranav Master, Senior Practice Leader and Director at Crisil Intelligence tells TOI, “As India enters 2026, global energy markets remain volatile. With over 85% dependence on crude oil imports, energy security has become a strategic necessity rather than a policy choice. In response, India has strengthened resilience by diversifying crude sourcing from fewer than 30 countries to around 40, spanning the Middle East, Africa, and the Americas. ”“This diversification, supported by robust refining capacity (around 258 MMTPA), and proactive steps taken by the government, has significantly reduced exposure to supply disruptions and price volatility for domestic consumers. While geopolitical risks persist, India has moved beyond being a passive price-taker and now exercises greater flexibility through procurement diversification and consistent diplomatic engagements,” he adds.Upgraded refinery capabilities now allow Indian refiners to rapidly switch among diverse Russian, American, and Middle Eastern crude oil grades based on price and compliance considerations.This transition has been driven by a move towards spot-market sourcing, supported by advanced refining infrastructure and strict compliance systems.India is also navigating the US pressure on Russian crude oil procurement by stepping up imports from the US. In fact, India’s crude oil imports from the US rose 92% in the first eight months of the current financial year! However, Russia remained the biggest supplier between April and November 2025.Sourav Mitra, Partner - Oil & Gas at Grant Thornton Bharat says, “India has made its stand clear that it will prioritise supply security and affordability for its 1.4 billion people. India did not deter from purchasing oil from Russia despite the US imposing 50% tariffs on India.”“India is tactfully navigating the situation by ramping up oil imports from the US even as Russian oil imports stay significant in FY26. India is maintaining a diverse sourcing mix in its crude basket amidst rising geopolitical uncertainty and Trump backing the Russia sanctions bill which proposes a 500% tariff on India,” he tells TOI.Manas Majumdar, Partner and Leader – Oil & Gas, Fuels & Resources at PwC India says that despite escalating sanctions and geopolitical turbulence, India remains relatively stable in terms of energy security as it has had a diversified set of suppliers - with close to 40 countries in the basket.“This broader supply pool enhances bargaining power, allows for various crude quality grades and insulates against geo-political disruptions. At one point, discounted Russian crude had grown to nearly 40% of our imports. This significantly eased cost pressures, and reduced dependence on other sources for e.g. Venezuela which helped in the short-term shocks. In the long-term if US sanctions on Venezuela go away and more oil flows, it can be a positive for India,” he tells TOI.Gaurav Moda, Partner and Energy Leader at EY-Parthenon India points out that given geopolitical dynamics especially in the past few years, the government and OMCs have diversified their sources of oil across several countries and providers. “Further, the OMCs have built up practice to keep 3-6 months stocks to iron out short term supply volatilities that have become inherent in the energy business. Such initiatives may help minimize impact on product supplies and end consumers in the near term,"" he tells TOI.Sumit Ritolia of Kpler notes one small but important movement on the domestic front: India continues to focus on strengthening its domestic supply base. “While crude oil production has not seen large step-change increases in recent years, upstream companies - led by national oil firms - have been steadily investing in enhanced oil recovery, redevelopment of mature fields and exploration of new sedimentary basins to stabilise output and slow natural declines,” he tells TOI.These efforts are aimed at creating incremental, durable gains rather than rapid spikes in production. Although domestic output cannot materially reduce import dependence, consistent upstream investment supports long-term resilience and helps improve energy security at the margin.“Collectively, diversified sourcing, strategic and commercial stockpiles, despite being below global benchmarks, and sustained efforts to strengthen domestic production place India in a relatively stronger position to navigate an increasingly uncertain global energy landscape,” he says.The biggest lure of the Russian crude oil, and the reason for its rising share in India’s crude oil basket has been the lucrative discounts. But what if under pressure from sanctions and tariffs, Indian refiners stop procuring discounted Russian crude?The answer isn’t straightforward, though the cost would be in billions: the impact on India’s crude import bill would depend on prevailing global market conditions, including supply–demand balances, benchmark prices, freight rates and the availability of alternative barrels.According to Sumit Ritolia, in 2025, India imported around 1.7 million barrels per day of such discounted crude from Russia, typically priced about $4–6 per barrel below other crudes in its import basket. At this differential, the cost advantage works out to roughly $3-4 billion per year.“If these volumes were replaced with alternative supplies at prevailing market prices, India’s crude import bill would rise by a similar order of magnitude, although the actual impact would ultimately depend on price movements, substitution costs and India’s ability to further optimise sourcing through diversification and refinery flexibility,” he explains.India currently imports over 85% of its crude requirement and this import bill is around $150 billion.Given Russian crude is a few dollars discounted to Brent (at peak this discount was more than $10-15+/ bbl), losing access to discounted Russian barrels could raise India’s annual crude bill by around $10 billion, says PwC’s Manas Majumdar. This estimate is based on a loss of roughly a $5‑per‑barrel discount across 1.85mbpd that India used to take earlier - however this quantum has reduced in recent times.Refinery margins may also be impacted, as discounted Russian crude is reduced, mostly for private refiners, he says. “We believe that losing these cheaper barrels would raise feedstock costs, and could shave around 1-2 percentage points off refining margins,” Majumdar tells TOI.In times of geopolitical uncertainties, supply shock possibilities, strategic oil reserves play a vital role. In the last few years India has been moving to shore up its strategic oil reserves to a 9–day cover which is what is standard maintained by OECD countries. However, there is still a long way to go.According to Sumit Ritolia, India’s strategic petroleum reserves currently stand at about 5.33 million metric tonnes. These are spread across underground caverns in Visakhapatnam, Mangaluru and Padur. This is around 39 million barrels, or around 9–10 days of national crude consumption.“While this is a meaningful safety net, it remains well below the 90-day cover maintained by most OECD economies when combining strategic and commercial stocks,” Ritolia points out.The government has announced Phase-II plans to add around 6.5 million tonnes of additional storage, but progress has been slow due to land acquisition and execution challenges, he adds.Manas Majumdar of PwC points to India’s planned expansion of strategic oil reserves at Chandikhol and Padur. In addition new sites are being planned in Bikaner, Bina. There is a capex allocation of around Rs 5000 crore plus for these expansions, and these plans need to be expedited, he tells TOI.“In addition, India can diversify strategic petroleum reserves storage types, and in addition to existing underground caverns blend with above-ground and commercial storage to enhance capacity. Also, bolster pipeline and trans-national supply chain resilience for crude flow and also to mitigate potential logistics chokepoints at areas like Strait of Hormuz,” he says.In addition to government-held strategic reserves, Indian refiners and oil marketing companies maintain their own inventories in the form of crude oil and refined petroleum products across refineries, pipelines and storage terminals.Experts differ on the number of days the stocks with oil marketing companies can cover.Ritolia says that these operational and commercial stocks can typically cater to domestic demand for an additional 10–20 days, depending on market conditions and throughput.“When combined with strategic petroleum reserves, these inventories provide India with a more meaningful buffer against supply shocks, even though overall emergency cover still falls short of global benchmarks and will need to expand in line with the country’s rising oil demand,” he says.However, Pranav Master of Crisil Intelligence says that combined with storage held by oil marketing companies, the total coverage stands at around 70–75 days.“Budgetary allocation for oil purchases reflects a shift toward proactive stockpiling during favorable price cycles, strengthening India’s ability to absorb future supply shocks. Apart from conventional coastal caverns, the exploration of salt-cavern-based storage should also be considered to enhance storage capacities,” he says.As India builds capacity to store more strategic petroleum reserves, it is important for it to speed up the process amidst ongoing geopolitical uncertainty that add to chances of supply shocks.“To better protect against global supply shocks, India needs to accelerate the completion of Phase-II strategic petroleum reserve capacity and ensure that existing and new caverns are consistently filled, well-maintained and operationally ready for timely release during emergencies,” says Sumit Ritolia.He is of the view that as demand continues to rise, expanding strategic petroleum reserves capacity in line with consumption growth will be critical to prevent a dilution of strategic cover over time.Experts also say that India needs to continue looking beyond crude to meet energy needs of the future.Sourav Mitra of Grant Thornton Bharat notes that India is doubling down on alternate sources of energy such as LNG, renewables, biofuels etc. to reduce oil dependency while ensuring reliability.According to a reply in Lok Sabha by MoS Petroleum and Natural Gas Suresh Gopi, to counter the reliance on fossil fuels, the government has adopted a multi-pronged strategy to promote clean energy - It is stepping up natural gas usage, improving refinery efficiency, and boosting domestic oil and gas production.In the meantime, it is also accelerating the adoption of biofuels and clean alternatives such as ethanol blends, bio-CNG, biodiesel, green hydrogen and EVs.Kpler’s Ritolia says that India would benefit from creating limited strategic reserves of refined products such as gasoline, diesel and aviation turbine fuel near major demand centres, which would help manage short-duration disruptions and logistical bottlenecks more effectively.“In parallel, strengthening domestic crude oil production should remain a key pillar of resilience. While large and rapid increases in output are unlikely, continued investment in enhanced oil recovery, redevelopment of mature fields and timely monetisation of discoveries can help stabilise production and deliver gradual gains. Alongside diversified imports and stronger stockholding, even incremental improvements in domestic output can reduce vulnerability at the margin and improve India’s ability to withstand external supply shocks,” he concludes.To sum it up: In a world of rising tensions, India has done well to diversify its crude basket so that temporary disruptions and choking of supply channels don’t have a long-term negative impact on the economy. Russia has only recently become a major oil supplier for India, and if it has to diversify away from it, the hit will not be too significant, though experts say Russian oil will not completely disappear. As it looks to build strategic oil reserves, there is a need to expedite the process, while also looking at non-fossil fuel based alternatives.","Recent geopolitical tensions and Trump tariffs on India highlight the need for India to step up focus on its energy security.

Cigarette tax hike: Experts warn of surge in illicit trade; fear major revenue losses for government,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/cigarette-tax-hike-experts-warn-of-surge-in-illicit-trade-fear-major-revenue-losses-for-government/articleshow/126334324.cms,"Representative image

A sharp increase in taxes on cigarettes, along with a new excise duty structure on tobacco products, could trigger a surge in illicit trade and lead to significant revenue losses for the government, experts have warned.Earlier this week, the finance ministry notified amendments to the Central Excise Act, introducing a fresh excise duty ranging from Rs 2,050 to Rs 8,500 per 1,000 cigarette sticks, depending on their length.The new excise duty, which comes into effect from February 1, will be levied in addition to the existing 40 per cent Goods and Services Tax ( GST ).This change implies an overall tax hike of around 60–70 per cent, varying by cigarette length, compared with the current overall tax incidence of about 50–55 per cent.The move marks a transition from the GST compensation cess to an excise-based regime for demerit goods.The unexpected nature of the tax increase has raised concerns about higher smuggling and illegal trade in tobacco products.According to news agency PTI, Ranganath Tannir, secretary general of Think Change Forum, said the steep rise could prove counterproductive. “Public finance theory is clear that excessive taxation of inelastic goods fuels illicit trade, not compliance,” he said, adding that cigarettes in India are already among the least affordable globally based on World Health Organization affordability indicators.Making them more expensive is unlikely to curb demand, but could push consumers towards illegal and smuggled products, undermining tax collections, he noted.Brokerage reports have echoed similar concerns. According to JPMorgan’s Asia Pacific Equity Research, a higher tax rate for the King Size Filter Tip (KSFT) segment increases the risk of consumers downtrading to cheaper options and may also lead to higher consumption of illicit cigarettes.Illicit tobacco already accounts for about 26 per cent of India’s total tobacco market, making the country the fourth-largest market globally for smuggled tobacco, PTI reported.Nomura, in its research note, said that while higher taxes are aimed at reducing consumption, they often have unintended consequences. “High taxes on cigarettes… fuel the growth of illicit cigarettes and push consumers towards cheaper, non-tax paid smuggled cigarettes,” the brokerage said.Jefferies, citing a report by the Tobacco Institute of India (TII), said the industry body has urged the government to review the proposed excise structure.A wider gap between legal and illegal prices could benefit non-duty-paid cigarettes and result in higher tax leakage, the report noted.Experts also pointed to international experience to underline the risks. Australia’s repeated tobacco tax hikes between 2012 and 2020 led to a sharp rise in cigarette prices and were followed by a jump in illicit tobacco consumption from under 2 per cent to around 14 per cent of the market.Calling the proposed excise levies “unprecedented”, an analyst said there is still time to reassess the decision before it comes into force.“Since they take effect from February 1, 2026, the government has an opportunity to revisit and rectify them before they spawn a much larger problem of uncontrollable illicit networks,” the analyst warned, as per PTI.","The finance ministry notified amendments to the Central Excise Act, introducing a fresh excise duty ranging from Rs 2,050 to Rs 8,500 per 1,000 cigarette sticks.

A country rich in oil, poor in production



Trump’s argument: security, speed and scale



ExxonMobil draws a clear boundary



Chevron’s limited optimism



Conditional interest from others



Economics and risk still dominate



What the meeting revealed



The bottom line



When US President Donald Trump met senior oil executives to press for investment in Venezuela, the message from the White House was deliberately ambitious. Venezuela has the world’s largest proven oil reserves. Its political landscape, Trump argued, has shifted. With American backing and security guarantees, the country should once again become a major destination for US energy capital.The response from the oil industry was notably restrained.Executives did not dispute Venezuela’s resource potential. Instead, they pointed to a combination of legal uncertainty, economic risk and hard-earned experience that continues to make large-scale investment unattractive, even with presidential support.Venezuela’s oil numbers are striking. The country holds an estimated 303 billion barrels of proven reserves, roughly 17% of the global total, more than any other nation. In the late 1990s, it produced over 3 million barrels per day, ranking among the world’s leading exporters.Today, output has fallen to below 1 million barrels per day. Years of mismanagement, underinvestment, sanctions and infrastructure decay have hollowed out what was once one of the most sophisticated oil industries in the developing world.This collapse is central to the scepticism voiced by oil companies. Restoring production on a meaningful scale is not a matter of restarting wells. It would require rebuilding pipelines, upgraders, refineries, power supply and skilled manpower, all of which demand long-term capital commitments.At the meeting, Trump urged companies to think big. He spoke of investments running up to $100 billion, promised “total security” for American firms and suggested deals could be finalised quickly. The broader geopolitical framing was also clear: US companies should move decisively to prevent China or Russia from expanding their footprint in Venezuela.From the administration’s perspective, Venezuela’s oil represents both an economic and strategic opportunity. For the companies in the room, however, the issue was not opportunity but risk.The most direct assessment came from ExxonMobil. Its chief executive described Venezuela’s current investment environment as “uninvestable”. The comment reflected Exxon’s long institutional memory. The company has operated in Venezuela since the 1940s, and has seen its assets expropriated twice, most recently during the nationalisation wave under Hugo Chávez.For Exxon, whose projects often involve tens of billions of dollars and operate over 20 to 30 years, the absence of durable legal protections is decisive. The company indicated it could send a technical team to assess the condition of assets, but stopped well short of committing capital.The distinction matters. Technical assessments are reversible. Large upstream investments are not.If Exxon articulated the industry’s red lines, Chevron illustrated what cautious engagement looks like. Chevron is already operating in Venezuela through joint ventures and special licences. At the meeting, it said production from its existing operations could increase by as much as 50% over the next 18 to 24 months.That figure, while significant, must be viewed in context. Chevron’s Venezuelan output remains a fraction of the country’s historical production. The projected increase reflects incremental improvements to existing assets, not the launch of new, capital-intensive projects.Chevron’s stance suggested that limited gains are possible where infrastructure and personnel are already in place, but that this does not justify a rapid expansion of exposure.Other companies struck a similar tone.Shell indicated it has several billion dollars’ worth of potential opportunities in Venezuela, but only if sanctions waivers and regulatory clarity are sustained over time. Without that certainty, the projects remain hypothetical. Oilfield services firms such as SLB expressed confidence in their ability to ramp up activity. Their optimism reflects a different risk profile. Service providers supply equipment and expertise and can scale operations more easily than producers who must commit capital to fields and infrastructure. Meanwhile, Continental Resources founder Harold Hamm, a close ally of Trump, described Venezuela’s reserves as a “real jewel” while declining to commit investment. The assessment captured the mood in the room: admiration without obligation.Beyond politics, the economics remain challenging. Much of Venezuela’s crude is heavy or extra-heavy, making it more expensive to extract and refine.Restoring production requires reliable access to diluents, functioning upgraders and stable export logistics. Industry estimates suggest that reviving Venezuela’s oil sector at scale would require tens of billions of dollars in upfront investment, with returns spread over decades. At a time when oil companies have access to lower-cost, lower-risk projects elsewhere, particularly in parts of South America and offshore developments, Venezuela struggles to compete on risk-adjusted returns.The White House meeting did not produce the sweeping commitments Trump had hoped for. Instead, it clarified the industry’s position. Oil companies are not disputing Venezuela’s resource base. They are questioning whether the legal, regulatory and political environment is stable enough to support long-term investment. Exxon wants structural reform before capital. Chevron will optimise what it already operates. Shell wants sustained sanctions clarity. Service companies are ready to engage, but operators remain cautious.Venezuela’s vast oil reserves are beyond doubt. What remains uncertain is whether the conditions needed to attract large, long-term investment can be put in place and sustained. Until oil companies are confident that contracts will be enforced, policies will remain predictable and political shifts will not undo commercial agreements, interest is likely to remain measured and capital deployment limited. The meeting underscored that for Big Oil, enthusiasm follows stability, not the other way around.","US President Donald Trump met senior oil executives to press for investment in Venezuela.

Fifth Oil Tanker With Venezuelan Oil ‘CAPTURED’; Russia Watches Closely

US President Donald Trump held talks with senior oil executives on Friday (local time), pushing them to consider investments in Venezuela’s oil sector following the capture of President Nicolas Maduro. While Trump presented the country as newly secure and open for business, industry leaders responded cautiously, with one major executive saying Venezuela remains “uninvestable” without deep reforms.Speaking at the White House, Trump said his administration would take charge of deciding which companies are allowed to operate in Venezuela, sidelining Caracas from the process. He argued that foreign firms had previously operated without adequate protections under Maduro and claimed the situation had now fundamentally changed.“We're going to be making the decision as to which oil companies are going to go in... (we're) going to cut a deal with the companies,” Trump said. “But now you have total security. It's a whole different Venezuela.”Trump added that oil companies would “deal with us directly,” signalling that Washington would manage access to Venezuela’s oil resources and exclude the country itself from negotiations.However, ExxonMobil chief executive Darren Woods raised serious doubts about returning to the country, citing the company’s history of asset seizures.“We've had our assets seized there twice and so, you can imagine, to re-enter a third time would require some pretty significant changes,” Woods said. “If we look at the legal and commercial constructs and frameworks in place today in Venezuela -- today, it's uninvestable.”The meeting came days after US forces seized Maduro, an action Trump has openly linked to Venezuela’s oil wealth. He said discussions with executives would centre on rapidly restoring the country’s deteriorated oil infrastructure and increasing output by millions of barrels per day.Those attending included Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Energy Secretary Chris Wright, along with executives from Chevron, ExxonMobil, ConocoPhillips, Halliburton, Valero, Marathon, Shell, Trafigura, Vitol Americas and Repsol.A ConocoPhillips spokesman said chief executive Ryan Lance valued the talks around “preparing Venezuela to be investment ready.”After the meeting, Trump said participants had “sort of formed a deal,” though he did not provide details. He claimed companies were ready to invest “at least 100 Billion Dollars” in the country.Analysts told AFP that the plan to revive Venezuela’s oil industry faces major obstacles. They said the size of the country’s reserves does not guarantee quick or profitable production, pointing to ageing infrastructure, political risks, costly heavy crude extraction and growing investor caution as the world moves away from fossil fuels.“There's lots of talk about the size of the reserves -- 300 billion barrels of proved reserves -- but what's often missing from the conversation is how realistic it is for those to be economically extracted,” said Rich Collett-White, an energy analyst at Carbon Tracker.Energy Secretary Chris Wright, who has previously said the US would control Venezuela’s oil industry “indefinitely,” acknowledged after the talks that rebuilding the sector would “take time.”Meanwhile, Venezuela’s interim President Delcy Rodriguez said her government remained in control of the country, while the state oil company said it was holding negotiations with Washington.Chevron is currently the only US firm licensed to operate in Venezuela.

'PM Modi-Trump Held 8 Calls In 2025': India Rejects Lutnick's Claim On Stalled Trade Agreement

The Supreme Court will not rule in the crucial case of US President Donald Trump's tariffs case on Friday. The ruling is being watched globally for its implications on all major economies. Earlier it was expected that the apex court would rule on the important issue on Friday.At the centre of the case is the legality of the so-called “Liberation Day” tariffs and whether the US president has the authority to impose them under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), a 1977 law that grants special powers during national emergencies. Back in 2025, lower courts had ruled that the tariffs were implemented illegally, however, allowed the import taxes to remain in force while the Trump administration appealed to the Supreme Court.The justices heard arguments in the case on November 5, during which both conservative and liberal members of the court expressed scepticism about whether the law gave the president unilateral authority to levy such broad duties. The ruling, issued after weeks of deliberation, now provides clarity on the scope of presidential power under IEEPA and the future of the tariffs imposed using it.The decision carries major financial implications. Companies have paid an estimated $133.5 billion in IEEPA-based tariffs through December 14, according to government data, with the total now believed to be closer to $150 billion, as estimated by Reuters.Hundreds of companies have taken legal action, filing lawsuits in the US Court of International Trade seeking to have the tariffs they paid declared unlawful and demanding refunds.More than 900 lawsuits have been filed on behalf of companies seeking tariff refunds, collectively naming over 1,000 plaintiffs, according to a tally compiled by Bloomberg. The list includes major brands such as Costco, Reebok, Peloton, Dole, Revlon and Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company, alongside firms including Kawasaki Motors, EssilorLuxottica, Bumble Bee Foods, Schick Manufacturing, Playtex, Spencer Gifts, PopSockets, Conair, Xerox, Dooney & Bourke, Barnes & Nobles, PUMA, Lane Bryant, Steve Madden, Bath & Body Works, Bose, TOMS Shoes, e.l.f. Cosmetics, J. Crew Group, Blick Art Materials and Diageo, Forbes reported. Those cases were put on hold pending the Supreme Court’s decision.","The Supreme Court will not rule in the crucial case of US President Donald Trump's tariffs case on Friday.

However, traders continue to expect at least two rate cuts later in the year.“Until the data provide a clearer direction, a divided Fed is likely to stay that way,” Ellen Zentner, chief economic strategist at Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, said. “Lower rates are likely coming this year, but the markets may have to be patient.”After the report, the yield on the 10-year US Treasury was steady at 4.19%, while the two-year Treasury yield edged up to 3.50% from 3.49%, reflecting shifting expectations for near-term Fed policy.On the corporate front, Vistra surged 14.6% after signing a 20-year agreement to supply electricity to Meta Platforms from three nuclear plants, highlighting rising power demand from data centres supporting artificial intelligence.

US Issues Blunt Warning To Indian Students: Breaking Laws May Cost Visas, Careers And Future Dreams

Hiring in the United States remained subdued in December, capping a year of weak employment gains, even as the unemployment rate edged lower, according to data released by the US Labor Department on Friday, AP reported.Employers added 50,000 jobs in December, nearly unchanged from a downwardly revised 56,000 jobs added in November. The unemployment rate slipped to 4.4 per cent from 4.5 per cent in November, marking its first decline since June, the data showed.The figures indicate that businesses remain cautious about expanding their workforces despite an improvement in overall economic growth. Many firms hired aggressively in the post-pandemic phase and now appear reluctant to add more workers, while others are holding back amid uncertainty linked to shifting US tariff policies, elevated inflation and the growing impact of artificial intelligence on jobs.The December report is being closely watched as it offers the first clear reading on the labour market in three months. The government did not release employment data in October due to a six-week shutdown, while November figures were distorted by the same disruption.December’s numbers also close out a year marked by slowing job creation. The economy generated an average of 111,000 jobs a month in the first three months of 2025, but that pace dropped sharply to just 11,000 a month in the three months ended August, before a modest rebound to 22,000 jobs in November.Economists note that weak hiring has emerged as a key puzzle for the US economy, which has continued to grow at a healthy pace. Growth reached an annualised 4.3 per cent in the July–September quarter last year, even as job gains softened and unemployment ticked higher through much of the year.With hiring losing momentum, the US Federal Reserve cut its key interest rate three times late last year to support borrowing, spending and employment. However, Fed Chair Jerome Powell has signalled that policymakers may hold rates steady in the coming months while assessing how the economy evolves.Despite low layoffs and a stable unemployment rate, economists remain divided on the outlook. Some expect hiring to pick up if growth remains strong, while others caution that automation and artificial intelligence could allow the economy to expand without a corresponding rise in jobs.","Hiring in the United States remained subdued in December, capping a year of weak employment gains.

What tariff refunds are the stakeholders expecting?

'Not guaranteed a refund'

The ongoing Supreme Court trial on US President Donald Trump’s use of emergency powers to impose global tariffs has left companies, customs brokers and trade lawyers preparing for a potentially prolonged battle over refunds that could total close to $150 billion.The court is expected to issue rulings on Friday, though it has not specified which cases will be decided. The challenge revolces around Trump’s use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) of 1977, a statute historically used to sanction foreign adversaries or freeze assets, to levy tariffs, according to Reuters. Trump is the first US president to apply the law for this purpose.Scepticism among both conservative and liberal justices during November’s oral arguments has fuelled expectations that the tariffs may be struck down, with questions raised over whether IEEPA grants the authority to impose such duties.Between February 4 and December 14, tariffs imposed under the emergency law generated an estimated $133.5 billion in collections, based on US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) data. Using average daily collections from late September to mid-December, Reuters estimated the total has since climbed towards $150 billion.Customs officials have made a recent technical change that has raised cautious optimism among importers.On January 2, CBP announced that tariff refunds would move entirely to electronic distribution through its ACE portal from February 6. While this stops short of a fully automated system, it suggests administrative readiness.“It does kind of signal that Customs is fully prepared to move forward with refunds, if the Supreme Court does, in fact, rule that way,” said Angela Lewis, global head of customs at logistics firm Flexport.CBP did not respond to questions on how it would handle an adverse ruling but said eliminating paper cheques would speed up payments and reduce fraud and errors. The US Treasury, which routinely processes hundreds of billions of dollars in tax refunds annually, also declined to comment on how tariff refunds would be managed.Treasury secretary Scott Bessent said the outcome of the case could be unclear but indicated that any loss of tariff revenue could be offset through other legal authorities. Speaking in Minneapolis, he said a ruling against Trump’s tariffs would mean “the president loses flexibility to use tariffs, both for national security, for negotiating leverage.”Trump introduced the IEEPA tariffs through two separate actions. In April, he announced “reciprocal” tariffs on imports from most US trading partners, citing a national emergency linked to trade deficits. Earlier, in February and March, tariffs were imposed on China, Canada and Mexico over fentanyl trafficking and illicit drugs, according to Reuters.Legal experts say the refund process will depend heavily on whether the Supreme Court provides explicit instructions or sends the issue back to a lower court, most likely the Court of International Trade. Under US rules, importers typically have 314 days to amend entries before they are “liquidated”, after which refunds are barred, a deadline that has already passed for some Chinese imports affected in February 2025.Despite the scale of potential repayments, companies fear that even a ruling against the tariffs will not automatically translate into refunds.“It's not in the government's DNA to give back money. And Trump would not want to give back money,” said Jim Estill, chief executive of Danby Appliances. The Canadian firm sells refrigerators, microwaves and laundry equipment through major US retailers, including Home Depot, and sources products from China and other Asian countries affected by the tariffs. Estill said Danby has paid about $7 million in duties and warned that recovering the money could trigger disputes further down the supply chain. “It's just going to be a dog's breakfast,” he said.To protect their positions, several companies have taken pre-emptive legal action against CBP. Costco said in court filings that even if the tariffs are ruled unlawful, importers “are not guaranteed a refund for those unlawfully collected tariffs” without judicial intervention. Similar lawsuits have been filed by Bumble Bee Foods, Revlon, EssilorLuxottica, Kawasaki Motors and Yokohama Tire, Reuters reported.Some smaller businesses are opting out of the wait entirely, selling their refund claims to hedge funds at steep discounts in a fast-growing secondary market. Toymaker Kids2 said it received 23 cents on the dollar for reciprocal tariffs and just nine cents for those tied to fentanyl-related duties.Jay Foreman, chief executive of Basic Fun!, which sells Tonka trucks, Care Bears and K’Nex toys, said he doubts the company will recover the $6 million it paid in tariffs ahead of the Christmas sales season. He expects the administration to “obfuscate or delay” payments even if refunds are ordered. While he has not sold the claim, he said he would consider it if it meant faster repayment.“The last thing the American public wants to know is a bunch of slick Wall Street or predatory-lender types will come and make a fortune off all this,” Foreman said.Advisers are urging companies to act quickly and keep detailed documentation. Pete Mento, a trade advisory director at Baker Tilly, said firms will likely need to demonstrate they paid IEEPA-based duties before any refund is issued. “The people that get their claims in early and have them done correctly are the ones who are going to reap the benefits the fastest,” he said. “And, knowing the way the processes work in Washington, it could be years before you see that money. ”","Supreme Court trial on US President Donald Trump’s use of emergency powers to impose global tariffs has left companies, customs brokers and trade lawyers preparing for a potentially prolonged battle.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021.

How India's GDP has been growing

What SBI report said on savings and investment

Incremental capital output ratio

NEW DELHI: India's gross domestic product (GDP) data for the third quarter (October-December 2022) received a word of caution from the former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan In an interview with news agency PTI, Rajan that India is ""dangerously close"" to the Hindu rate of growth in view of subdued private sector investment, high interest rates and slowing global growth.India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying"".However, a report released by the State Bank of India (SBI) economists on Tuesday dismissed arguments that India is dangerously close to Hindu rate of growth saying such statements are ""ill-conceived, biased and premature"".The term 'Hindu growth rate' was coined by late economist Raj Krishna in 1978 to describe the slow growth in the country.It basically refers to the low pace of economic growth rates during 1950s to 1980s. During this period, the Indian economy averaged 3.5%.A former lecturer at the Delhi School of Economics (DSE), Krishna noted that only if the rate of growth is persistently slow and accompanied by low per-capita GDP, then it will be known as Hindu rate of growth but it has to factor in population growth as well.Before economic reforms of 1991, India's economic growth remained stagnant and low, while per capita income averaged around 1.3%.Krishna termed this low growth situation to be a result of socialist policies of state control and import substitution.However, the economic situation changed when liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation (LPG) reforms came into effect in the year 1991, at a time when India faced balance of payment crisis.Over the years, many economists have strongly opposed the idea of 'Hindu growth rate' and the term never had universal acceptance.The Indian economy plunged into its very first technical recession in FY21 due to the impact of Covid-19 pandemic and the related nationwide lockdowns. GDP shrunk by an unprecedented 23.8% in the first quarter of the financial year 2020-21. However, due to spurt in economic activities in the subsequent quarters, the GDP decline started to narrow.However, if we look at the period before Covid-19 as well, India's growth curve shows a declining trend.From 8.26% in FY17, GDP growth plunged to 3.74% in FY20. Shutdown of economic activities in FY21 in wake of Covid-19 only made matters worse.As lockdowns started to ease and business activities resumed, India's GDP also started rising. In Q1 of FY22, growth jumped to 20.1% mainly on account of low base effect. By the fourth quarter of FY22, growth came down to 4.10%.Similarly, the new financial year 2022-23 brought fresh economic challenges in the form of Russia-Ukraine war that impacted almost all major economies of the world, slowed the pace of growth, pushed inflation to record highs.As a result, the central banks of all advanced economies spurred into action and opted for monetary policy tightening to curb the soaring inflation.With persistently rising interest rates, India's economy grew by 4.4% in Q3 of FY23, as the Centre revised upwards GDP growth for previous year to 9.10% from 8.7% earlier.The report weighed recent GDP numbers against the available data on savings and investments for the past decade and highlighted some interesting points.""Quarterly growth numbers are noisy and should be best avoided for any serious interpretation (on an average, India's GDP growth has witnessed Rs 2 lakh crore upward revision for the 3 year ended FY23),"" the report said.Gross capital formation (GCF) by the government touched a high of 11.8% in 2021-22, up from 10.7% in 2020-21.""This also had a domino effect on private sector investment that jumped from 10 per cent to 10.8% over the same period,"" it said.In fact, Ecowrap added that the trends in GCF to gross output ratio or the plough back of funds for creation of fresh capacity shows that for public administration the ratio attained fresh peak in 2021-22 owing to the emphasis on capital expenditure in recent budgets.At the aggregate level, gross capital formation is supposed to have crossed 32% in 2022-23, the highest level since 2018-19.According to the report, in 2021-22, gross savings have risen to 30% from 29% in 2020-21.""The ratio is supposed to have crossed 31 per cent in 2022-23, the highest since 2018-19. The household savings increased sharply during the pandemic period on account of sharp accretion in financial savings such as deposits,"" said the report by SBI's Economic Research Department.While household financial savings have since then moderated from 15.4% in 2020-21 to 11.1% in 2022-23, savings in physical assets have grown sharply to 11.8% in 2021-22 from 10.7% in 2020-21.The report further analysed Incremental Capital Output ratio (ICOR) -- which measures additional units of capital (investment) needed to produce additional units of output. It said that the ratio has been improving.""ICOR which was 7.5 in FY 12 is now only 3.5 in FY22. Clearly, only half of capital is now needed for next unit of output,"" the report noted.Such reducing ICOR in the current years reflects a relatively increasing efficiency of capital and shows that the economy is on a sound footing, the report said.""From that point of view, future GDP growth rates even at 7% could still mean a decent number by any standards!,"" it added.","India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%. Raghuram Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying""","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-98483158,imgsize-65724,width-400,resizemode-4/98483158.jpg"
"Find less costly ways to address pension concerns instead of OPS, says Raghuram Rajan",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/find-less-costly-ways-to-address-pension-concerns-instead-of-ops-says-raghuram-rajan/articleshow/98457871.cms,"NEW DELHI: Former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan has expressed his concern over the decision of some states to restart the old pension scheme and suggested that some less costly ways should be found to address the demands of government pensioners.Rajan further said the old pension scheme does involve massive future outlays because of the indexation of pensions to current salaries.""This is an enormous obligation, not necessarily in the short run, but in the long run,"" he said, adding obviously, state governments have to think through the long-term implications for government finances, and whether civil servants are the most in need of help among the constituencies they deal with.Rajan, currently Katherine Dusak Miller Distinguished Service Professor of Finance at The University of Chicago Booth School of Business, said as he understands it, it may be infeasible technically or legally to move back to the old pension scheme.""If so, there may be less costly ways of addressing the concerns that prompt such moves,"" Rajan told PTI in an email interview.In a major move, a select group of central government employees have been given a one-time option to opt for old pension scheme.The employees who joined the central government services against posts advertised or notified before December 22, 2003, the day National Pension System ( NPS ) was notified, are eligible to join the old pension scheme under the Central Civil Services (Pension) Rules, 1972 (now 2021).Under Old Pension Scheme (OPS), employees get a defined pension. An employee is entitled for a 50 per cent amount of the last drawn salary as pension.OPS was discontinued by the NDA government in 2003 with effect from April 1, 2004.Under the new pension scheme (NPS), employees contribute 10 per cent of their basic salary towards pension while the government contributes 14 per cent.Governments of Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand have informed the central government/ Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA about their decision to restart OPS for their employees.The government of Punjab on November 18, 2022, issued a notification regarding implementation of OPS for the state government employees who are being covered under NPS. Jharkhand too has decided to revert to OPS.",Former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan has expressed his concern over the decision of some states to restart the old pension scheme.

Govt fixes wheat procurement target at 34.15 million tones for 2023-24,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/govt-fixes-wheat-procurement-target-at-34-15-million-tones-for-2023-24/articleshow/98373076.cms,"NEW DELHI: The government has fixed a wheat procurement target of 34.15 million tonnes for the 2023-24 marketing year starting April, higher than 18.79 million tonnes purchased in the previous year.The target was fixed in the meeting of state food secretaries held alongside state food ministers' conference here to discuss procurement arrangements. The meeting was chaired by Food Secretary Sanjeev Chopra.Out of the total wheat procurement target for the 2022-23 marketing year (April-March), Punjab will aim to procure 2.5 million tonnes wheat, Haryana 1.5 million tonnes and Madhya Pradrsh 2 million tonnes, the food ministry said in a statement.Wheat procurement had declined last year due to a fall in domestic production and higher exports.However, the government has projected a record wheat production at 112.18 million tonnes in the 2023-24 crop year (July-June) as per the second estimate of the agriculture ministry.Besides wheat, the government has also fixed rabi (winter) rice procurement target at 10.6 million tonnes in the 2022-23 marketing year.States have been advised to enhance rice milling capacity so that milling of one season gets completed before the commencement of next season and recycling of rice may be avoided.Whereas procurement of millets and coarse grains is estimated to be 7,50,000 tonnes this year, higher than 6,30,000 tonnes in 2021-22. Karnataka will procure 6,00,000 tonnes of millets this year, the statement added.Separately addressing the conference, food minister Piyush Goyal urged all state governments to implement smart-PDS at the earliest.He lauded Andhra Pradesh government's Command Control and stated that the central government will work together for implementing it in other states also.On the storage front, the Union minister said FCI is upgrading godowns into five-star rated ones and state governments can also upgrade their godowns.In the conference, all the state governments were told to learn from the best practice of using millets in schemes like mid-day meal and PDS in Karnataka, which is helpful in adding nutrition and promoting healthy diet.States were encouraged to procure more millets and coarse grains. All the state governments were asked to open procurement centres for coarse grains in producing districts, especially, in tribal areas. State governments were asked to encourage consumption of coarse grains as well.The conference also deliberated on fighting anaemia and nutritional deficiencies in various parts of the country by suitably creating awareness on benefits of fortified rice.The issues related to smart Public Distribution System (PDS) and One Nation One Ration Card scheme for seamless delivery of foodgrains to migrant beneficiaries were also discussed.FCI (Food Corporation of India) is the government's nodal agency that undertakes procurement and distribution of foodgrains for the PDS and welfare schemes.The best practice of command control centre by Andhra Pradesh for real time data on procurement, storage, quality and distribution of foodgrains was also discussed, for which all states have been urged to learn and adopt the methods to make their systems effective and efficient.Further, implementation of additional minimum threshold parameters for online procurement operations, i.e. integration of power validation of milled rice quantity with electricity consumption and tracking of vehicles used for transporting food grains were also deliberated upon for improving efficiency and transparency in procurement operations.During the discussion, it emerged that sufficient jute bags are available as per requirement of ensuing season. Issues related to finalisation of audited accounts, food subsidy claims and rationalisation of food subsidy was also deliberated upon.State governments have also been asked to submit their pending bills to FCI so that those can be settled in March 2023.",The government has fixed a wheat procurement target of 34.15 million tonnes for the 2023-24 marketing year starting April.

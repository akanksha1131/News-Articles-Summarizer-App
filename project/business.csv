Indian benchmark indices witnessed heightened volatility during the last week, with markets trading under a persistent downward bias. The negative momentum was primarily influenced by weak global cues and sustained selling by Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs). Volatility remained elevated throughout the week due to prevailing global uncertainties, particularly concerns surrounding US trade tariff policies and geopolitical issues related to Greenland. These factors contributed to cautious investor sentiment and limited risk appetite across equity markets. Additionally, the Indian rupee came under significant pressure, with USD/INR hitting a fresh record low of 91.74. The sharp depreciation of the domestic currency further weighed on market sentiment, adding to the downside pressure on benchmark indices.Geopolitical tensions eased somewhat during the latter half of the week following developments at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. President Donald Trump stated that a framework plan had been finalized to address US interests in Greenland, thereby reducing the likelihood of imposing additional tariffs on European nations that had previously opposed the proposed annexation of the Arctic island.The proposed framework is expected to include US mineral rights in Greenland as well as the deployment of the “Golden Dome,” a multi-layered missile defense system designed to enhance US national security.Nifty is forming a sizable bearish candle with a long lower shadow in the weekly chart and is currently placed around 200 days EMA placed around 25170 levels. Buying demand during the week has emerged near the key support zone of 25,000–24,800. This area aligns with the prior breakout level and the lower band of the rising channel on the weekly timeframe.Following a sharp 1,400-point decline over just 12 sessions, the index has entered extreme oversold territory on the daily chart. A technical pullback appears likely in the near term, with immediate resistance hurdles at 25,400-25,500.Post the recent sharp decline. We expect some consolidation within the 25,500–24,800 range. Only a move above 25500 will open further upside towards the major breakdown area of 25,700.Bank Nifty continues to outperform the Nifty, displaying clear relative strength as it continues to consolidate in the range of 58700-60400.The 58,700–59,000 zone remains a key short-term support. Although the index briefly dipped to 58,278.6 on Wednesday session, it did not close near the lows, indicating buying interest at lower levels. This area also coincides with the lower end of the seven-week consolidation range and the 50-day EMA, making it a crucial support.A decisive break below this zone could accelerate the downside towards 57500-58,000. On the upside, resistance is placed around the previous all-time high of 60,200–60,400.Stock is seen rebounding after a base at the trendline support joining previous major highs signaling a Change of Polarity.On the downside key support is placed at 570-560 levels being the confluence of the bullish gap area of Thursday and key retracement of last 2 sessions pullback.We expect the stock to head towards 645 levels being the recent breakdown area.The stock has generated a breakout above a falling trendline joining highs of the last 2 months signaling resumption of up move and offers fresh entry opportunity.On the downside key support is placed at 2300-2270 levels being the presence of recent trendline support and key retracement of the recent up move.We expect the stock to head towards 2520 levels being the 61.8% retracement of the previous major decline (2750-2245).","Indian benchmark indices witnessed heightened volatility during the last week, with markets trading under a persistent downward bias.

Why is the stock market crashing today?

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market, other asset classes or personal finance management tips given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)

Stock market crash today: Heavy selling pressure dragged benchmark indices down, with Nifty50 settling 241.25 points lower at 25,048.65 and the Sensex closing 769.67 points lower at 81,537.70.Friday’s decline followed a rebound in the previous session, when benchmark indices had ended a three-day losing streak. Early trade sentiment had drawn limited support from gains in Asian markets and easing geopolitical concerns related to Greenland, but those factors failed to sustain the rally.The selloff led to the combined market capitalisation of BSE-listed firms shrinking by Rs 5.7 lakh crore to Rs 452.69 lakh crore, according to an ET report.Persistent foreign institutional investor selling remained the key pressure point. FIIs sold equities worth Rs 2,550 crore on Thursday, extending their selling streak to 13 consecutive sessions in January. So far this month, they have been net buyers on only one occasion, January 2.The ongoing contest between overseas investors trimming exposure and domestic institutions providing support has continued into the new year.“The pattern of sustained FII selling and DII buying which dominated the market trend in 2025 has been continuing in 2026, too, so far,” said Dr. VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Investments, adding that whether this trend will shift with FIIs returning as buyers remains a key question for investors.Vijayakumar said the Union Budget scheduled for February 1 could provide some direction if it includes proposals supportive of the markets, but stressed that foreign investor behaviour will hinge more on the trajectory of corporate earnings in India.“Partly the Budget to be presented on February 1st will offer some insights, if there are some market-friendly proposals. More importantly, the FII stance towards India will be determined by the trend in India’s corporate earnings. Higher earnings growth alone can ensure sustained buying by FIIs since they have the option to invest in other markets where valuations are cheaper and earnings are better. Since earnings growth is sometime away and the FII selling strategy is expected to continue, preempting any healthy rally, the market is heavily net short. FIIs are adding to the short positions on every rally triggered by some positive news. The broader market, where FII presence is limited, is like to witness action in response to Q3 results,” he said.Meanwhile, pressure on domestic financial assets deepened as the rupee slipped to a fresh record low against the US dollar, adding to caution in equities. The currency fell beyond its earlier low of 91.7425 to touch 91.77, weakening by around 0.2% on the day. Persistent demand for dollars from importers and corporates outweighed early stability in the currency market, intensifying strain on the rupee. The latest slide underscored concerns over capital outflows and strong dollar demand, further weighing on investor confidence in local stocks.","Friday’s decline followed a rebound in the previous session, when benchmark indices had ended a three-day losing streak.

US Claims PM Modi ‘didn’t call’; MEA Rebuts

India-US trade deal: US President Donald Trump on Wednesday said that America would have a ‘great’ trade deal with India. Trump’s statement came during his visit to the World Economic Forum (WEF) that is being held at Davos in Switzerland.Speaking to Moneycontrol on the sidelines of the WEF, Trump praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi and expressed confidence in an India-US trade deal. “I have great respect for your Prime Minister. He’s a fantastic man and a friend of mine. We are going to have a good deal,” Trump was quoted as saying. Trump had earlier delivered an over one hour long speech at WEF.Trump’s remarks come at a time when the US has imposed 50% tariffs on India - which is among the highest in the world. While both countries have reiterated that trade talks and negotiations continue, a deal still remains elusive. Of the 50% tariffs, 25% are for India's crude oil imports from Russia, something that the Trump administration claims helps fund the Russian war against Ukraine.Meanwhile, earlier this month, US Ambassador to India Sergio Gor assumed charge and expressed confidence in India-US ties. Sergio Gor voiced strong support for the ongoing trade negotiations, saying both countries are firmly committed to reaching an agreement.While describing the bond between Trump and PM Modi as genuine, Gor said the US president could visit India “hopefully in the next year or two”.He said the India-US relationship rests not only on shared interests but also on engagement at the highest political levels, adding that true partners may differ at times but ultimately resolve their disagreements.“Remember, India is the world's largest nation, so it's not an easy task to get this across the finish line, but we are determined to get there. And while trade is very important for our relationship, we will continue to work closely together on other very important areas such as security, counterterrorism, energy, technology, education, and health,” he added.Gor praised PM Modi, calling him an exceptional leader. “I was with the President…and as we had dinner right after New Year's, he recounted his incredible experience visiting here and also his great friendship with the great Prime Minister of India, Prime Minister Modi,” said Gor, who previously served as a close aide to Trump. “I've traveled all over the world with President Trump, and I can attest that his friendship with Prime Minister Modi is real,” he added.At the same time, earlier this month, US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick claimed that the India-US trade deal failed to materialise because PM Modi did not place a call to Donald Trump. The Ministry of External Affairs, however, said the description of events was inaccurate and reaffirmed India’s willingness to pursue a trade pact that delivers benefits to both sides.Lutnick had said on a podcast that India had “missed the train” by not reaching out to Trump within a three-week window, unlike leaders from several other countries.Responding to the remarks, MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said India and the United States had been engaged in discussions on a bilateral trade agreement since February 13 last year and had repeatedly come close to finalising a deal.“We have seen the remarks. India and the US were committed to negotiating a bilateral trade agreement with the US as far back as Feb 13 last year… On several occasions, we have been close to a deal… We remain interested in a mutually beneficial trade deal between two complementary economies and look forward to concluding it,” he said.India and the US have held five rounds of official-level talks since negotiations began last February, alongside discussions at the ministerial level. Jaiswal also noted that Prime Minister Modi and President Trump had spoken by phone eight times in 2025, covering a broad range of issues linked to the bilateral partnership.",US President Donald Trump on Wednesday said that America would have a ‘great’ trade deal with India.

Adani Group stocks today: Shares of several Adani Group companies including Adani Green, Adani Enterprises, Adani Energy and Adani Ports have dropped by up to 10% after the US Securities and Exchange Commission sought a US court’s approval to serve summons directly by email to Gautam Adani and Sagar Adani.An indictment made public in November 2024 claims that executives of the Adani Group were part of an alleged bribery scheme involving Indian officials to obtain power purchase agreements for electricity produced by Adani Green EnergyAccording to the filing quoted in a Reuters report, the SEC told the court that its earlier attempts to deliver the summons through official channels had failed after India declined two such requests. The matter represents the most prominent legal case involving an Indian conglomerate in the United States, with the regulator trying since last year to serve notices on Adani Group founder Gautam Adani and his nephew Sagar Adani.Following these developments, Adani Green shares dropped 10% to an intraday low of Rs 823, while shares of the group’s flagship company, Adani Enterprises, slid 8% to touch Rs 1,936. Adani Ports stock fell 5% to Rs 1,343, and Adani Energy declined 8% to Rs 852 per share.Reuters said the SEC informed the court that it does not expect service to be completed using existing procedures and has therefore requested permission to send the summons electronically to the two executives.The Adani Group has rejected the allegations as unfounded and said it will take all legal steps available to defend its position.The US Securities and Exchange Commission has also accused the executives of misleading American investors by issuing incorrect disclosures about the company’s anti-corruption policies.The SEC filing quoted by Reuters said India turned down requests to serve summons on procedural grounds, citing issues such as signature and seal requirements. The regulator maintained that these conditions do not apply under international frameworks governing cross-border service, including the Hague Convention. The document added that in its second rejection in December, India’s law ministry also appeared to raise questions over the SEC’s authority to seek such service.",US Securities and Exchange Commission sought court's approval to serve summons directly by email to Gautam Adani and Sagar Adani.

Gold futures on MCX are trading near ₹1,56,540 after witnessing a sharp recovery from intraday lows. The price action indicates a base formation above key short-term supports, with buyers gradually regaining control. The broader intraday structure suggests that the recent pullback is corrective in nature, and a continuation of the up-move remains likely if prices sustain above the breakout zone.EMA 8 & EMA 21: The 8 EMA has turned upward and is attempting to move above the 21 EMA, reflecting improving short-term momentum. Price sustaining above this EMA cluster supports a bullish intraday bias and indicates that dips are being absorbed by buyers.Bollinger Bands: Gold has rebounded from the lower Bollinger band and is now moving toward the mid-band. This shift suggests easing selling pressure and opens room for a move toward the upper band near ₹1,60,000 if momentum sustains.Gold’s intraday technical structure has turned constructive, supported by EMA crossover, improving RSI, and a positive MACD setup. The successful defense of lower supports suggests that buyers remain active on declines. Traders are advised to initiate long positions in the ₹1,57,500–₹1,58,000 zone, maintain a strict stop-loss below ₹1,55,000, and look for an upside move toward ₹1,60,000 during the session.","Gold’s intraday technical structure has turned constructive, supported by EMA crossover, improving RSI, and a positive MACD setup.

Embraer project could take off from either Gujarat or Andhra Pradesh,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/embraer-project-could-take-off-from-either-gujarat-or-andhra/articleshow/127336694.cms,"Embraer existing FAL in Brazil (Picture source: Embraer)

NEW DELHI: India’s first final assembly line (FAL) for commercial fixed-wing aircraft could come up in either Gujarat’s Dholera or Andhra Pradesh's Bhogapuram, with Dholera widely being seen as the frontrunner. Brazilian regional aircraft major Embraer and the Adani Group's upcoming JV FAL is being aggressively wooed by both states that are implementing very ambitious aerospace plans for these two places. India is looking at giving fiscal incentives to customers placing orders for made-in-India planes.A formal announcement for the Adani-Embraer JV is expected next Tuesday, when more details may emerge. The two groups did not comment for this story on the likely location of the FAL.Taking the Airbus-Tata Advanced Systems Ltd (TASL) FAL for 70-seater military transport aircraft C295 at Vadodara as a benchmark, the Embraer FAL could take 3-4 years to get ready and then another year to roll out its first aircraft. Embraer regional jets have 70 to 130 seats.India had decided to acquire 56 C295 in September 2021 to replace the IAF’s ageing AVRO fleet with the terms being that 16 of these planes will come in a fly-away condition from Spain and the rest will be made in India.Soon thereafter, work started on an FAL in Vadodara, which was jointly inaugurated by PM Modi and his Spanish counterpart Pedro Sanchez in Oct 2024.The first made-in-India C295 is expected to roll out by this September. So it took about five years from the time the agreement was reached to the first aircraft rolling out. A similar timeline is likely for the made-in-India Embraer.A Tata-Airbus JV for light commercial chopper H125 in Hyderabad is expected to take 1.5 years to get ready and roll out the first early next year. PSU Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd has tied up with Russia’s United Aircraft Corp to make SJ-100 regional passenger jets in India. HAL’s made-in-India 19-seater Dornier 228 is yet to get commercial acceptability here.A commercial fixed-wing aircraft FAL is the biggest and most visible success for Modi’s Make in India policy in the aviation space. Its successful execution will mean putting the entire assembly line ecosystem in place which could eventually get Airbus and Boeing to follow suit.As of now, Airbus — which counts IndiGo as its biggest single aisle customer globally — does sourcing from India worth $1.5 billion annually and will raise this figure to $2 billion before 2030. Boeing’s sourcing from India is at $1.25 billion annually. Despite having mega orders from IndiGo, Air India group and Akasa, the two biggies currently don’t have any FAL plans for India. While Airbus has FALs in France, US, Germany, China and Canada, Boeing has in US and China.Given the economic multiplier effect, both Gujarat and Andhra are eyeing the Embraer FAL. For Gujarat, having an FAL in Vadodara and then one 151 km away in Dholera will mean having a big aerospace belt. Bhogapuram is getting a new airport which, one ready, will serve as the only commercial aviation hub for Visakhapatnam.This is what the two places are doing:Dholera: Dholera International Airport Co Ltd (DIACL), a SPV formed by the Airports Authority of India (AAI) & the Gujarat government, is developing an aviation hub. “Dholera Airport (will have) two parallel class runways and matching infrastructure… shall give opportunity to develop allied aviation industries such as maintenance, repair, overhaul (MRO) aviation academy…” DIACL website says.Bhogapuram: The GMR Group, which operates hubs in places like Delhi, Hyderabad & Goa (Mopa), is developing the Bhogapuram Airport. It plans a massive aerospace park. GMR Group founder & chairman G M R Rao had said last Nov: “…we are also developing an integrated aerospace ecosystem on 500 acres of land. This park will attract global aerospace and defence manufacturers and house the world's largest MRO and create a complete aerospace ecosystem. ” The upcoming airport will also attract original equipment manufacturers and R&D units, he had added.",India's first final assembly line (FAL) for commercial fixed-wing aircraft could come up in either Gujarat’s Dholera or Andhra Pradesh's Bhogapuram.

NEW DELHI: India's commercial vehicle industry needs a stronger and well-designed vehicle scrappage policy to accelerate the replacement of old trucks, cut pollution and lower logistics costs, Ashok Leyland MD and CEO Shenu Agarwal said, as the sector sees a sharp demand rebound after GST 2.0.According to Siam, commercial vehicle sales touched a record 10.3 lakh units in 2025. Agarwal said GST rationalisation played a key role in lifting demand, not merely through price cuts but by improving overall consumption and freight movement.He said average age of India's truck fleet rose to nearly 11 years from seven-eight years, making operations more expensive and less efficient. While fleet owners recognise that BS6 trucks are far more fuel-efficient than older BS2 and BS3 vehicles, many are waiting for a clearer policy push.","India's commercial vehicle industry needs a stronger and well-designed vehicle scrappage policy.

Some launches make noise. Others make history. Last week in Delhi NCR, Elie Saab did both.Last week, Elie Saab marked its India entry with a debut that was bold, confident, and impossible to ignore. In a rare global first, the legendary Maison unveiled two branded residential projects simultaneously in one country, signalling India’s emergence as a serious destination for global luxury living.The unveiling unfolded across two impeccably curated evenings attended by designers, tastemakers, global media, and cultural influencers. The energy was unmistakably international, vibrant, and celebratory. This was not a routine launch. It was a defining moment.At the centre of this milestone stood Pankaj Bansal, Founder of Smartworld Developers and Promoter at M3M India, whose design-led vision brought Elie Saab to India. Hosted alongside Aishwarya Bansal, Co-founder of Smartworld Developers, the collaboration reflects a shared philosophy rooted in craftsmanship, elegance, and long-term value.The presence of Elie Saab and his family, including Madame Saab and Elie Saab Jr., added authenticity and gravitas to the occasion. Their involvement underscored that this partnership goes far beyond branding, translating couture precision into architectural expression.The first project, Smartworld Residences by Elie Saab in Noida, spans six acres and will feature approximately 650 residences, supported by an investment of Rs. 1,500 crore. The second project, developed with M3M India along the Dwarka Expressway in Gurugram, will comprise 300 ultra-premium homes with an estimated investment of Rs. 2,000 crore. Construction on both developments is set to begin within days, starting with foundation work.The launch celebrations captured the dual spirit of the Maison. One evening pulsed with global glamour, highlighted by a dynamic performance from Nora Fatehi. The other unfolded with refined intimacy, accompanied by a live Belgian ensemble.With this landmark dual launch, Elie Saab has not just entered India. It has redefined the conversation around luxury living in NCR.","The first project, Smartworld Residences by Elie Saab in Noida, spans six acres and will feature approximately 650 residences.

'Stanford Ranks Us Third': Ashwini Vaishnaw Fires Back At IMF For Calling India Second Tier In AI

India's Office of the Principal Scientific Adviser has released a white paper on AI governance, proposing a ""techno-legal"" framework to balance innovation and risk.The framework integrates legal safeguards, technical controls, and institutional mechanisms to ensure trusted AI development, according to the Office of Principal Scientific Advisor to GoI press release.'Strengthening AI Governance Through Techno-Legal Framework' outlines a comprehensive institutional mechanism to operationalise India's AI governance ecosystem, emphasising that the success of any policy instrument depends on its effective implementation.The proposed framework aims to strengthen the broader AI governance ecosystem comprising industry, academia, government, AI model developers, deployers, and AI users.Central to this initiative is the establishment of the AI Governance Group (AIGG), chaired by the Principal Scientific Adviser. This group will coordinate between various government ministries, regulators, and policy advisory bodies to address ""the current fragmentation in governance and operational processes"".Within the techno-legal governance context, this coordination aims to establish uniform standards for responsible AI regulations and guidelines.The AIGG will be tasked with ""promoting responsible AI innovation and the beneficial deployment of AI in key sectors"" while identifying regulatory gaps and recommending necessary legal amendments.Supporting the AIGG is a dedicated Technology and Policy Expert Committee (TPEC) to be housed within the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY). This committee will pool multidisciplinary expertise from areas such as Law, Public Policy, Machine Learning, AI safety, and cybersecurity.According to the white paper, the TPEC will assist the AIGG on matters of national importance, including global developments in AI policy and emerging AI capabilities.The framework also introduces the AI Safety Institute (AISI), which will serve as the primary centre for ""evaluating, testing, and ensuring the safety of AI systems deployed across sectors"". The AISI is expected to support the IndiaAI mission by developing techno-legal tools to address content authentication, bias, and cybersecurity. It will generate risk reports and compliance reviews to inform policy decisions while facilitating cross-border collaboration with global safety institutes and standards-setting bodies.To monitor post-deployment risks, a national AI Incident Database will be established to record, classify, and analyse safety failures, biased outcomes, and security breaches nationwide.

Every passenger landing in India from overseas, after completing immigration and collecting their baggage, has to pass through Customs, where goods beyond the permitted duty-free allowance must be declared through the Red Channel, else the passenger can simply pass through the Green Channel. India's duty-free baggage allowance was last updated in 2016, prescribing allowance limits on which no duty is payable for different categories of passengers (see box).Under the current baggage rules, travellers can bring up to 100 cigarettes, 25 cigars or 125 grams of tobacco, and two litres of alcohol/wine duty-free. Personal ornaments (other than gold or silver in any other form) are allowed. However, firearms, more than 50 cartridges, and LCD televisions are not permitted. Overall, these rules are broadly in line with international practices.Indians returning after staying abroad for work, study or business also get extra relief. They can bring used household items duty-free based on their stay up to Rs 1 lakh up to one year, Rs 2 lakh up to two years, and Rs 5 lakh for more than two years. Those staying abroad for over one year may also bring jewellery duty-free up to 20g up to Rs 50,000 for men and 40g up to Rs 1,00,000 for women.The Rs 50,000 limit was reasonable in 2016, but inflation has reduced purchasing power. Goods costing Rs 50,000 in 2016 now cost closer to Rs 75,000 as common travel purchases like clothing, footwear, perfumes, cosmetics and electronics have become more expensive. This gap between rising prices and a static baggage allowance has created difficulties for travellers.When the rules were framed, an allowance of Rs 50,000 was adequate for several items. However, changes in prices and purchasing power over time means the situation is much different today. In 2016, $1 cost about Rs 67, so a $750 item cost roughly Rs 50,000. In 2026, $1 has risen to around Rs 90, making the same item cost about Rs 67,500, making travellers pay almost Rs 17,500 more for the same product purely on account of exchange rate difference without even factoring in the rise in price.At the same time, the economic position of Indian citizens has improved over the last decade. Per capita income has risen sharply, reflecting higher earnings and spending capacity. However, the duty-free baggage allowance has remained unchanged, creating a clear mismatch with today's reality.A look at an indicative travel basket (see chart) shows that items that fit within the Rs 50,000 limit in 2016 now cost close to Rs 1,00,000 after accounting for inflation, even without any luxury purchases. That points to a need to increase the allowance to Rs 1,00,000 to match current realities.Passengers should be aware that international travel is subject to closer scrutiny. India has Customs Cooperation Agreements with many countries to share information in real time. As a result, high-value purchases made abroad and tax refunds claimed may already be known to Indian Customs, often leading to Red Channel checks.Accordingly, the govt in the upcoming budget may consider increasing the duty-free baggage allowance from the present Rs 50,000 to Rs 1,00,000. An increase in the allowance would better reflect today's costs and current travel realities. Additionally, higher duty-free spending would boost business at Indian airports, increase foreign exchange earnings and result in higher revenue for govt as passengers use baggage limit to buy products at duty-free shops in India. Also, the baggage limit on transfer of residence needs to be increased.","India's duty-free baggage allowance was last updated in 2016, prescribing allowance limits on which no duty is payable for different categories of passengers.

For many taxpayers with simple income profile, filing an Income Tax Return (ITR) has become easier over the years, but it remains an important annual compliance requirement that demands time and attention. With better technology and rising expectations for convenience, a question arises whether we can move towards complete automation of ITR filing.Let's look at how our country is progressing towards a simpler, smarter, and user-friendly ITR filing experience.India's tax system has made greater progress in making the tax return filing easier by pulling together data from various sources into the Income tax department's database.Sign up on the e-filing portal, using PAN as the user ID, create a password, and you are ready to upload your tax return.Many details now appear automatically in the ITR, such as personal information, PAN, Aadhaar, bank information, salary data, personal income and tax paid details.Information reported in earlier years, such as foreign assets, directorships, unlisted shares etc.is also pre-populated, saving time and effort.The Annual Information Statement (AIS) and Taxpayer Information Summary (TIS) provide a consolidated list of all your income, tax and financial activities.You can verify your tax return instantly using Aadhaar OTP or net banking, so you are no longer required to mail signed ITR-V form to the tax authorities.While the taxpayer is required to verify & reconcile the details appearing in the income tax database, the above features have reduced mistakes when entering data and made the process much easier.Income tax department has already made strong progress through AIS/TIS, pre-filled returns, faceless assessments, and a rapidly improving e-filing portal. However, a truly automated tax return filing needs more than upgrades but a structural change. Here are a few areas that could be looked at for further improvement:All financial institutions and govt systems need to share information through common, standardised channels so that tax department can compile accurate data.Today's prefilled returns still miss several income items, such as interest income splits, capital gains data from different brokers, rental income, exempt categories, and digital asset earnings etc.Govt can move towards a single, simplified tax regime along with rationalising capital gains and TDS provisions to automate the filings for simpler tax returns.The e-filing portal has already improved the online filing experience, but there's still room to make it faster and more efficient. Quicker AIS/TIS updates and automatic real-time error checks before submission, could be few steps to make the process easier for taxpayers.Another widely discussed idea is whether employers can submit relevant details for their salaried employees to eliminate ITR filing.Right now, Form 16 captures data regarding salary, deduction(s), taxes and personal income details to certain extent. However, the complexity arises for employees with multiple income streams, especially foreign income or other personal financial details that employers will not be aware of. While it's an idea with clear potential, the same requires comprehensive design to work for every taxpayer.Full automation is certainly within reach for simpler tax returns. However, tax returns involving tax-treaty claims (including Form 67 filings), business income, capital gains, foreign income, foreign asset disclosures etc., will still need to follow the existing process due to complexities, with automation applied, wherever practical.Though certain challenges remain, the tax department continues to advance towards a smarter, smoother, and more intuitive tax-filing system, for better taxpayer experience.","Filing an Income Tax Return (ITR) has become easier over the years, but it remains an important compliance requirement that demands time and attention.

Gold price prediction

today:

are touching new record highs due to heightened geopolitical tensions, says Praveen Singh, Senior Fundamental Research Analyst- Currencies and Commodities at Mirae Asset Sharekhan.

Here’s his outlook on gold prices:

Gold Performance:

In the week ending January 16, the spot gold surged nearly 2% to close at $4595. The rally in the week came on the heels of a sharp 4.6% rise in the week ending January 9.

Driven by safe haven demand as the US President on January 17 threatened 8 EU nations with 10% tariffs beginning February 1 in retaliation to their opposition to his Greenland plans, the yellow metal extended its rally to a fresh record high of $4690 on January 19.

At the time of writing this article, the shiny metal was changing hands at $4672 (MCX February contract Rs 145,500), up 1.67% for the day.

ETF and COMEX gold inventory:

As of January 16, total known global gold ETF holdings stood at 99.86 MOz, highest since August 2022, and are up nearly 1% YTD, as holdings rose for the second straight week.

Registered COMEX gold inventory at 18.86 MOz, is up around 1 MOz from the cycle low of 17.86 MOz but is down over 22% from the record peak of 24.25 MOz seen on April 7.

The US Dollar Index fell around 0.15% to 99.08 on January 19 after rising for three straight weeks.Two-year and ten-year treasury yields jumped nearly 2% last week as the US President expressed doubt over the appointment of Kevin Hassett, a key proponent of lower rate policy. Trump wants to keep him at the White House.The US Bond market was closed on January 19 to observe Martin Luther King Jr Holiday.Trump rattled NATO allies over the weekend after threatening to impose 10% tariffs on 8 EU nations starting February 1 if he doesn’t get control of Greenland.Tariffs will be increased to 25% from June 1. The proposed tariff will be due and payable until a deal is reached for complete and total purchase of Greenland.US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that Europe was too weak to ensure Greenland’s security in an interview on Sunday.International Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said it’s too early to gauge the economic impact of tensions over Greenland, though it could be a headwind for growth.EU ambassadors met on Sunday to discuss options if Trump follows through with his threats. They are considering €93 billion ($108 billion) worth of American goods. The bloc’s leaders are due to meet for an emergency summit on Thursday.The European Union is once again weighing whether to use its most powerful economic weapon — the anti-coercion instrument (ACI) — in a dispute with a major trading partner. The instrument allows the EU to deploy an array of measures in response to coercive trade tactics. It may include new fees on EU imports of US goods and services, curbs on US investments in Europe or a ban on American firms bidding for public contracts.The pending US Supreme Court ruling on some of Trump’s earlier tariffs may come as soon as Tuesday.President Trump will address the annual World Economic Forum in Davos this week and may offer details of home ownership plans for helping Americans buy homes by making it possible to take money out of their 401(K)s and use that for downpayment.Bloomberg reported that respondents in a World Economic Forum survey identify 'geoeconomic confrontation' and 'state-based armed conflict' as the two biggest risks to the global backdrop in 2026.As per Axios, the US officials plan to focus on economic growth, home ownership and peace through strength at WEF, Davos.China’s data released on January 19 showed that China’s economy grew 4.5% on an annualized basis in Q4 2025 vs 4.4% expected. China’s retail sales hit a 3-year low in December, trailing the forecast. Similarly, China’s industrial production, fixed asset investment (December) trailed their respective forecasts.Last week’s data showed that US CPI (December), despite expectations of coming out to be hot on downward adjustments in the November CPI data, was tame. CPI y-o-y was up 2.7% (forecast 2.7%, prior 2.7%). The core CPI also rose 2.7% y-o-y (forecast 2.7%, prior 2.7%). Retail sales advance was up 0.6% m-o-m Vs the estimate of 0.5% and prior reading of -0.1%), while retail sales control group up 0.4% (forecast 0.4%, prior 0.6%).PPI final demand data were hotter than expected though.Industrial production data, released on Friday, was up 0.4% m-o-m (forecast 0.1%) in December.Major US data on the deck this week include 3Q GDP final reading (January 22), real personal spending (January 22), PCE Price Index (January 22) and S&P Global US PMIs, University of Michigan consumer sentiment and inflation expectations (January 23).Major Eurozone data to be released this week include CPI (January 19), services and composite PMIs (January 23). The UK’s CPI (January 21), services and composite PMIs (January 23) will also be monitored by investors.Fresh escalation in geopolitical tensions over Greenland as Trump threatens the EU nations with tariffs to achieve his goal is an unexpected development which is supporting gold prices. Heightened worries and repercussions may also affect global trade and economy. Otherwise, gold could have come under pressure due to diminishing possibility of Hassett becoming the next Fed Chair, a firmer US Dollar and thawing geopolitical tensions as Iran strike had been averted.Still, US Supreme Court ruling over Trump’s tariffs may create huge short-term volatility as his tariffs may be lacking legal basis, though the Trump Administration could resort to other clauses to keep most of the tariffs in place.Trump extending the EU tariff deadline will also weigh on the yellow metal.Spot gold may test resistance around $4750 (MCX February contract Rs 148,000) amid elevated US-EU tariff tensions.However, considering the risks involved, buyers are urged to exercise caution and to put suitable stoploss. Support is at $4608 (Rs 143,500)/$4560 (Rs 142,000). Interim resistance is at $4707 (Rs 146,500).Spot silver surged over 12% in the week ending January 16 as it closed at $89.94 on January 16.Shanghai Gold Exchange Silver price (T+D) at 23271 CNY/Kg is equivalent to around $104/Oz.US imposing tariffs on EU means that the expected flow of silver inventories from COMEX warehouses to LBMA warehouses will be disrupted, which will tighten the spot market.Spot silver, currently at $94.42 (MCX March contract Rs 309,660), up nearly 5% for the day, is expected to trade with a positive bias that will strengthen should the metal closes above $94 mark for two straight days. It may rise to test the resistance zone of $98-$100 (MCX March contract Rs 321,000-Rs 328,000). However, as mentioned earlier in the gold section, utmost caution is needed with a suitable stoploss in place. Support is at $90 (Rs 295,000)/$86 (Rs 282,000).","Gold prices touching new record highs due to heightened geopolitical tensions, says Praveen Singh, Senior Fundamental Research Analyst- Currencies and Commodities at Mirae Asset Sharekhan.

The United States has extended a temporary operating licence for Serbia's sanctioned oil company, the latter's energy minister confirmed on Friday, as negotiations continue over the exit of Russian majority shareholders.Washington's sanctions on the Petroleum Industry of Serbia (NIS), part of its crackdown on Russia's energy sector, have previously forced a months-long shutdown of the country's only oil refinery.Production restarted earlier this month after a temporary reprieve was granted by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), which was due to expire at midnight.But according to Serbian Energy Minister Dubravka Djedovic Handanovic, the licence has now been extended until February 20.""We have secured almost an additional month for NIS to continue operating, to be supplied via the Adriatic Oil Pipeline, JANAF, and for crude to continue arriving in Serbia,"" Handanovic told local TV Pink.A previous March 24 deadline remains for negotiations over the full exit of Gazprom's interest in the company, with Hungarian energy giant MOL agreeing to basic terms with Russian firm earlier this week.After months of delay, Washington imposed sanctions on NIS on October 9, cutting off supplies to the refinery.The move has had a strong impact in Serbia, a close Kremlin ally and one of the few European states not to sanction Russia over the war in Ukraine.NIS employs about 13,500 people in Serbia and contributed over two billion euros ($2.5 billion) in tax revenue in 2024 or nearly 12 percent of the national budget.The company operates around 330 petrol stations, roughly one in five nationwide, and if acquired by MOL, the combined network would exceed 380 stations.The company also operates in Bosnia, Romania, Bulgaria and Angola.Serbia sold a majority stake in NIS to Gazprom in 2008 for 400 million euros ($470 million), with several billion invested since.NIS is currently 45 per cent owned by Gazprom Neft, which is under US sanctions, while the parent company, Gazprom, transferred its 11.3 per cent stake in September to its affiliated firm, Intelligence.The Serbian state owns nearly 30 percent, with the rest held by minority shareholders. Officials say the state intends to raise its stake by 5 percent after a sale.MOL has also confirmed that it is in talks with ADNOC, the national oil company of the United Arab Emirates, to join as a minority shareholder.",Washington's sanctions on the Petroleum Industry of Serbia (NIS) have previously forced a months-long shutdown of the country's only oil refinery.

Apart from its traditional role as a hedge during periods of economic and political turmoil, demand for silver has also been boosted by its extensive industrial use, including in solar panels, electronics and jewellery.Gold, often seen as silver’s sister metal, was also trading near record territory, closing in on the $5,000-an-ounce mark as investors continued to rotate into hard assets amid heightened global uncertainty.“As high-risk as gold may be, it has nothing on silver which continues to outperform in the most extraordinary fashion,” David Morrison, senior market analyst at Trade Nation, said.Amidst the tight supply conditions of the metal as silver increasingly being snapped up for use in data centres and artificial intelligence-related infrastructure.Silver had last hit a major milestone on October 9, when it crossed $50 an ounce, its highest level since 1980, underscoring the speed and scale of the current rally.","Silver prices surged to an all-time high of $100 an ounce on Friday.

US stocks edged lower on Friday as a turbulent week marked by tariff threats and reversals headed toward a calmer finish, with investors turning cautious amid limited clarity on trade and geopolitical signals.In early trade, the S&P 500 slipped 0.1%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 258 points, or 0.5%, AP reported. The Nasdaq Composite was largely flat. Markets were on track to end a second straight week with modest losses after sharp swings earlier in the week.Sentiment remained guarded after US President Donald Trump said he had reached a “framework” with Nato on Greenland, even as details remained sparse and no agreement has been signed. Trump had earlier walked back tariff threats against several European allies, which had triggered heavy volatility earlier in the week.Stock-specific moves added to pressure. Intel tumbled sharply after issuing a weaker-than-expected forecast for the first quarter, citing supply constraints despite beating profit expectations. The stock’s slide weighed on broader technology sentiment.Bond and currency markets were relatively subdued compared to earlier turbulence.Long-term Japanese government bond yields eased after spiking to record levels earlier in the week, helping calm global markets. The 40-year Japanese bond yield slipped below 4% after breaching that mark previously.In Europe, markets were mixed in midday trade, with Germany’s DAX marginally higher while France’s CAC 40 slipped. Asian markets closed mostly higher, led by gains in Japan after the Bank of Japan held rates steady and slightly upgraded its outlook for inflation and growth.Commodities traded firmer. Gold rose 0.6% to around $4,945 an ounce, while silver jumped more than 3%, nearing the $100 level, reflecting continued safe-haven demand. In energy markets, US crude rose above $60 a barrel, while Brent crude climbed past $65.Overall, markets appeared to be catching their breath after a volatile week, with investors awaiting clearer signals on trade policy and the global economic outlook.","The S&P 500 slipped 0.1%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 258 points, or 0.5%.

Under the new agreement, the short video platform will be operated through a majority American-owned joint venture.“I am so happy to have helped in saving TikTok! It will now be owned by a group of Great American Patriots and Investors, the Biggest in the World, and will be an important Voice,” Trump said. He also credited the app for boosting his appeal among younger voters, saying it “was responsible for my doing so well with the Youth Vote in the 2024 Presidential Election”.Trump further added, ""I only hope that long into the future I will be remembered by those who use and love TikTok."" He also thanked US vice president JD Vance and others in his administration who supported the agreement and also acknowledged Chinese President Xi Jinping for approving the arrangement, saying, “I would also like to thank President Xi, of China, for working with us and, ultimately, approving the Deal. He could have gone the other way, but didn’t, and is appreciated for his decision. ”Trump’s remarks came as TikTok confirmed it has finalised the formation of TikTok USDS Joint Venture LLC, a newly created entity intended to run its business in the United States and avoid a long-threatened ban linked to ByteDance’s Chinese ownership.Company said that the joint venture will cater to more than 200 million American users and about 7.5 million businesses. It will also operate with tighter safeguards around data protection, cybersecurity, content moderation, and the app’s recommendation algorithm.Under the ownership structure, US and international investors will jointly control 80.1% of the venture, while ByteDance will retain a 19.9% stake. Oracle, Silver Lake and Abu Dhabi-based MGX are among the biggest investors, each taking a 15 per cent share. Smaller stakes have been allotted to the Dell Family Office, Alpha Wave Partners, Revolution and NJJ Capital.The agreement follows several years of political and regulatory scrutiny in Washington. Pressure began mounting in 2020 when Trump sought to block the app over national security concerns. More recently, a law passed under former president Joe Biden required ByteDance to divest its US business or face a ban in TikTok’s largest market.TikTok said the US operation will function as an independent company guided by a seven-member board, with American directors forming the majority. Adam Presser has been appointed chief executive of the US business and will be responsible for securing US user data while driving growth across TikTok and its related apps.","US President Donald Trump, on Friday, hailed TikTok’s new deal and thanked Chinese President Xi Jinping for approving to ""save"" the platform.

US inflation data: Fed’s preferred gauge stays above target; January rate cut pause in focus,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-inflation-data-feds-preferred-gauge-stays-above-target-january-rate-cut-pause-in-focus/articleshow/127182448.cms,"Borrowing To Look Powerful? Pakistan Pays $1bn For Trump's Gaza Peace Seat While Seeking UAE Rescue

The US Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation measure remained elevated in November, reinforcing expectations that policymakers are likely to pause further interest rate cuts as they assess the impact of earlier easing and new trade-related pressures.Data released by the US Department of Commerce on Thursday showed that the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index rose 2.8% year-on-year in November, marginally higher than 2.7% in October and still above the Fed’s long-term 2% inflation target, AFP reported. On a monthly basis, inflation rose 0.2% in both October and November.Consumer spending continued to show resilience, increasing 0.5% month-on-month in both October and November, though economists cautioned that the momentum may be built on weakening fundamentals.The data, which was delayed due to the prolonged US government shutdown in late 2025, is not the most current snapshot of the economy. Nevertheless, it is expected to factor into the Federal Reserve’s policy deliberations when it meets next week.After three consecutive interest rate cuts in 2025, which brought the benchmark policy rate to a range of 3.50% to 3.75%, the central bank is widely expected to hold rates steady in January.Policymakers are seen preferring to evaluate the cumulative impact of earlier rate reductions, especially as President Donald Trump’s tariff measures begin filtering through supply chains.The Fed continues to balance inflation risks against labour market conditions while adjusting borrowing costs. The persistence of inflation above target underscores the complexity of that task.Excluding volatile food and energy prices, core PCE inflation rose 2.8% year-on-year in November, up from 2.7% in October, signalling limited progress toward disinflation.Analysts at Pantheon Macroeconomics said inflation is still likely to undershoot the Fed’s own projections over time. This, they noted, is due to “the relatively low level of tariff revenues, negligible momentum in new rents, and signs that wage growth is set to slow further.”However, they warned that despite “surprisingly resilient” consumer spending, the expansion appears fragile. “This strength looks built on increasingly shaky foundations,” economists Samuel Tombs and Oliver Allen said in a note, pointing to pressures on real after-tax incomes.The report also showed that the personal saving rate slipped to 3.5% in November, down from 3.7% in October, a level Pantheon described as “unsustainably low.”","US Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation measure remained elevated in November.

India-US Trade Talks Ongoing In Complex Environment, Says Mukesh Aghi

Strong consumer spending lifted the US economy to its fastest growth rate in two years in the July–September quarter, even as job creation remained subdued and concerns over the cost of living persisted.America’s gross domestic product expanded at an annual rate of 4.4% in the third quarter, a slight upward revision from the earlier estimate of 4.3% and faster than the 3.8% growth recorded in the April–June period, according to data released by the Commerce Department on Thursday, AP reported.The latest reading marks the strongest quarterly performance since the third quarter of 2023, driven largely by robust household consumption. Consumer spending, which accounts for about 70% of US economic output, grew at a healthy annual pace of 3.5%, the data showed.A sharp rise in exports alongside a decline in imports also contributed to the strong overall growth in the quarter, according to the government figures.The economy has shown resilience despite uncertainty linked to President Donald Trump’s policies, particularly the imposition of double-digit tariffs on imports from most countries.Still, the strong headline growth has not translated into widespread public confidence. Many Americans remain unhappy with economic conditions, especially the high cost of living, even as spending stays firm.Economists point to a possible “K-shaped economy”, where higher-income households benefit from stock market gains and rising investments, while lower-income groups struggle with stagnant wages and elevated prices.The labour market, meanwhile, appears significantly weaker than overall economic growth suggests. Employers have added an average of just 28,000 jobs a month since March, far below the roughly 400,000 jobs created monthly during the 2021–23 post-pandemic hiring boom.Despite the slowdown in hiring, the unemployment rate remains low at 4.4%, indicating what economists describe as a “no-hire, no-fire” environment, with companies cautious about both expanding payrolls and laying off workers.",America’s gross domestic product expanded at an annual rate of 4.4% in the third quarter.

Asian stocks climbed Thursday following a relief rally in the United States after President Donald Trump stepped back from his threat to impose tariffs on several European countries over their opposition to a US takeover of Greenland. Safe-haven metals, including gold and silver, extended their losses.Asian markets were broadly higher, with Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 rising 1.9 percent to 53,760.85, while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng and Shanghai’s Composite each gained 0.2 percent, closing at 26,630.21 and 4,123.69 respectively, reported AFP.The market swings came after Trump had warned that Germany, France, Britain, and Denmark could face levies for opposing his Greenland plan. The threat had raised fears of a trade war, with French President Emmanuel Macron hinting at the possible use of a previously unused economic deterrent.Traders breathed easier Wednesday when Trump told the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos that he would not take the Danish territory by force and later confirmed he had retracted the planned tariffs.""We have formed the framework of a future deal with respect to Greenland and, in fact, the entire Arctic Region,"" Trump wrote on Truth Social, without giving further details.""Based upon this understanding, I will not be imposing the Tariffs that were scheduled to go into effect on February 1st.""The announcement fueled a US stock rally of more than one percent, which had fallen on Tuesday after the long weekend. Asian markets followed suit, with gains in Tokyo, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Sydney, Seoul, Singapore, Taipei, and Manila.""After days of market fretting over Greenland turning from diplomatic curiosity into tariff ammunition, the president arrived in Davos and did what markets have quietly come to expect.

Financial author Robert Kiyosaki on Thursday took to X to highlight silver’s rising importance in the global economy, describing it as “superior” to gold in the Technology Age.In his post, Kiyosaki wrote, “Gold and silver have been money for thousands of years. But…in today’s Technology Age….silver is elevated into an economic structural metal…much like iron was the structural metal of the Industrial Age. ”Kiyosaki noted the dramatic rise in silver prices over the past decades, pointing out that in 1990 it was around $5 an ounce, while in 2026 it has reached $92 an ounce.“Silver is growing more vital as the structural metal of the world’s economic future….a store of value….and as money. I am still calling for silver to hit $200 an ounce in 2026,” he added, while acknowledging the possibility of being wrong.The surge in silver prices comes amid a record-breaking rally in precious metals globally.Silver recently touched $95 per ounce internationally, while domestic rates in India reached Rs 3.34 lakh per kilogram, continuing a nine-day upward streak.Analysts attributed the rally to strong safe-haven demand, tight global supply, geopolitical uncertainties, and a weaker rupee, which kept domestic prices elevated compared with international benchmarks.Saumil Gandhi, senior analyst at HDFC Securities, said, “Gold and silver hit new record highs, driven by persistent safe-haven demand and inflows into bullion-backed exchange-traded funds,” as quoted by news agency PTI.Renisha Chainani, head of research at Augmont, noted that rising geopolitical risks and macroeconomic uncertainty are further strengthening gold and silver demand, with silver prices likely to extend their upward trend.Kiyosaki’s post positions silver not just as a hedge but as a strategic economic metal, mirroring its growing global significance amid ongoing market volatility and rising demand for industrial and technological applications.","Financial author Robert Kiyosaki on Thursday took to X to highlight silver’s rising importance in the global economy.

US natural gas extends historic run: Prices soar nearly 60% in three sessions,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-natural-gas-extends-historic-run-prices-soar-nearly-60-in-three-sessions-whats-fueling-the-surge/articleshow/127093567.cms,"AI image

US natural gas futures surged to around $3.50, gaining about 8.35 per cent in a single session, extending an already historic rally that has seen prices rise nearly 60 per cent over the past three days.Trading volumes remained heavy, reflecting intense repositioning in the market as traders reacted to tightening supply-demand dynamics.The sharp rise is being driven by colder-than-expected weather forecasts across large parts of the Midwest and Northeast, which are pushing up heating demand.This comes at a time when storage levels are already below seasonal norms, leaving little cushion against sudden demand shocks, reported ET.Production growth has failed to keep pace with the jump in consumption expectations, as producers had remained cautious after prolonged periods of low prices. As a result, even small changes in demand assumptions are now triggering outsized price moves.Liquefied natural gas exports are adding further pressure. US export terminals are operating near capacity, sending large volumes overseas and reducing gas available for domestic storage.This has tightly linked US gas prices to global markets, limiting how quickly prices can ease.The price spike has also triggered fuel-switching in the power sector. As gas prices moved past key thresholds, coal became a cheaper option for many utilities, resulting in the need for a reassessment of fuel mixes.At the same time, electricity prices were already under strain due to rising demand from AI data centres, especially in the PJM region, where capacity prices have risen sharply in recent years.The surge coincides with a severe Arctic cold wave sweeping across the US, with millions of households increasing heating usage.AccuWeather has warned that extreme cold could leave hundreds of thousands without power or heat, further intensifying demand pressures.In contrast, crude oil prices have lagged, weighed down by ample global supply, highlighting a growing divergence across commodity markets, with inflation risks increasingly concentrated in gas and electricity rather than the broader energy complex.","US natural gas futures surged to around $3.50, gaining about 8.35 per cent in a single session.

"Fed independence test: US Supreme Court signals support for Lisa Cook, questions Donald Trump’s bid to remove her",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/fed-independence-test-us-supreme-court-signals-support-for-lisa-cook-questions-donald-trumps-bid-to-remove-her/articleshow/127027975.cms,"The US Supreme Court on Wednesday appeared inclined to allow Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook to continue in office, signalling scepticism over President Donald Trump ’s attempt to fire her — a move that could have far-reaching implications for the independence of the central bank, AP reported.During nearly two hours of arguments, a majority of the nine-judge bench questioned the basis and timing of Trump’s effort to remove Cook, the first Black woman to serve as a Fed governor, over allegations of mortgage fraud that she has strongly denied. No US president has fired a sitting Fed governor in the institution’s 112-year history.Allowing Cook’s removal to proceed “would weaken, if not shatter, the independence of the Federal Reserve,” Justice Brett Kavanaugh said, echoing concerns raised by several other justices. At least five members of the court appeared doubtful that Trump’s action should be allowed to take effect while Cook’s legal challenge is still pending.Both Cook and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell were present in the packed courtroom as the justices considered whether Cook should remain in her post while lower courts continue to review the case. Judges in those courts have so far allowed her to stay on the Fed’s seven-member board.The case is being closely watched by Wall Street and policy circles, as Trump’s critics argue that the underlying motivation is his desire to exert greater control over US interest-rate policy. If Cook were removed, Trump could appoint a replacement and potentially secure a majority on the Fed board.Trump has repeatedly criticised the Fed for not cutting rates aggressively enough, arguing that sharply lower rates would reduce government borrowing costs and ease pressure on households buying homes, cars and other big-ticket items. Speaking earlier on Wednesday at the World Economic Forum in Davos, he again called for the US to have “the lowest interest rates in the world”.The Fed cut rates three times in the last four months of 2025 but has signalled caution going forward because of inflation concerns.The immediate issue before the court is procedural: whether Cook can remain in office while the dispute plays out. The justices could deny Trump’s emergency appeal, leaving her in place for now. Chief Justice John Roberts suggested it may be ineffective to simply send the matter back to lower courts without offering clearer guidance.The confrontation has escalated sharply. The Justice Department has opened a criminal investigation into Powell and issued subpoenas to the Fed — actions Powell has publicly described as “pretexts” masking frustration over monetary policy.Trump’s legal team argues that Cook’s alleged mortgage filings — claiming two properties as primary residences in 2021 — amount to “gross negligence at best” and justify her dismissal. Cook, who has not been charged with any crime, denies wrongdoing, saying the case rests on a single, innocuous reference contradicted by other accurate disclosures.While the Supreme Court has previously allowed Trump broad latitude to dismiss heads of other agencies, the justices signalled that the Fed’s unique, quasi-independent status may warrant a different approach.",US Supreme Court appears inclined to allow Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook to continue in office. The move could have far-reaching implications for the independence of the central bank.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021.

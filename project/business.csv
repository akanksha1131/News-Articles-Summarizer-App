No more TACO? What happens to Trump's tariffs after US attack on Iran? From ‘World Chickening Out’ to ‘No One Chickens Out’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/no-more-taco-what-happens-to-trumps-tariffs-after-us-attack-on-iran-from-world-chickening-out-to-no-one-chickens-out-heres-what-may-happen/articleshow/122030403.cms,"Donald Trump’s decisions on tariffs have become more crucial than ever.

China Sides With Iran, Greenlights Hormuz BLOCKADE? Beijing's First Response As U.S. Seeks Help

Operation Midnight Thunder

What will happen to Trump's tariffs ? 4 scenarios to consider

‘The World Chickens Out’: The first possibility involves other nations interpreting Trump's actions as a serious warning sign, whilst viewing the strikes as an isolated incident that temporarily halts the Middle East tensions. This prompts countries to offer substantial compromises to Washington, hastening to finalise trade agreements before Trump's Liberation Day tariffs deadline of July 9. This represents the White House's likely preferred outcome: ""The World Chickens Out"", according to Bloomberg. ‘Trump Chickens Out Rationally’: The subsequent scenario suggests that the weekend military action intensifies the ongoing conflict, triggering elevated oil prices, worldwide economic disruption and volatile financial markets throughout summer. Trump responds by postponing his tariff implementation. However, the economic consequences remain significant, whilst continued trade uncertainty creates additional challenges. This represents: ""Trump Chickens Out Rationally"". ‘Trump Holds Hands With the World’: The third possibility envisions an unexpected global unity, including the US, to counter economic repercussions. A unified approach to stabilise oil prices and financial markets, coupled with renewed international cooperation, results in minimal global economic disruption. This could be termed: ""Trump Holds Hands With the World."" ‘No One Chickens Out’: The fourth and most concerning scenario suggests Trump, encouraged by his initial actions, pursues an aggressive strategy. Iran responds by blocking Gulf oil shipments. Despite soaring oil prices and market downturns, Trump intensifies his tariff policies. As the Liberation Day duties suspension ends, American trade barriers reach levels unseen since the 1800s. Major economies implement countermeasures, leading to worldwide trade disruption. Both global and US economies enter recession. Trump maintains his stance as international tensions escalate, potentially leading towards widespread conflict. This scenario could be labelled: ""No One Chickens Out.""

Alternative outcomes or combinations of these scenarios might prove more realistic.

US strikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities have had one important consequence - globally markets are aware that Donald Trump will not always ‘chicken out’! US President Donald Trump's military strike on Iranian nuclear installations, alongside Israel's ongoing conflict with Iran, has introduced additional geopolitical uncertainties into an already unstable global economic landscape.In this backdrop, Trump’s decisions on tariffs have become more crucial than ever. Prior to the weekend attacks, financial markets and America’s trading partner were possibly operating under the principle that ""Trump Always Chickens Out, or TACO"". This notion suggested that each severe threat, including that of high reciprocal tariffs, would ultimately be watered downTrump's implementation of tariffs risks elevating prices and hampering economic growth. However, the prevalent belief suggested these effects would manifest as mild economic discomfort rather than severe financial distress.The widespread acceptance of ""TACO"" has encouraged market optimism, despite economists' warnings about the impending effects of Trump's tariffs on domestic and international economies.Also Read | Nightmare scenario: How Iran, hit by US & Israel strikes, may choke world’s oil supply via Strait of Hormuz - explained This belief has also strengthened the resolve of nations in negotiations with the president, who has openly expressed his eagerness for agreements and established a July 9 deadline through a 90-day postponement of his most severe tariff measures. Some countries have questioned the necessity of yielding to Trump’s demands when retreat appears inevitable. But, that may change now!The US president's decision to strike Iran, contrary to advice from his closest allies, demonstrates his unpredictable leadership style.His willingness to take action where previous administrations hesitated shows a departure from conventional diplomatic approaches.According to a Bloomberg report, the global economic impact of ""Operation Midnight Thunder"" hinges on Iran's response. Should tensions escalate, leading to Iran blocking the Strait of Hormuz and causing oil prices to rise, it would create additional strain on an already vulnerable global economy weakened by existing trade tariffs.The situation might prompt international markets and policymakers to reassess their interpretation of Trump's warnings. This military action proves his readiness to follow through on serious threats when diplomatic negotiations fail to achieve his desired outcomes, the report said.It's important to note that whilst economic conflicts typically cause less devastation than military ones, every conflict impacts the economy. This situation will likely follow the same pattern.Also Read | Iran-Israel war & US bombings: Should possible Strait of Hormuz closure worry India about its oil supply?

No longer chasing the brick-and-mortar stores business in India: Walmart,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/no-longer-chasing-the-brick-and-mortar-stores-business-in-india-walmart/articleshow/122055993.cms,"Is there a rush to stock up before the reciprocal tariffs make a comeback? How are tariffs affecting you and American buyers?

Have tariffs changed the sourcing dynamics? Have you increased your purchases from US suppliers?

Has 'China+1' resulted in more sourcing from India?

Flipkart has been late to enter quick commerce. How will its growth trajectory look like?

Does it mean more cash burn?

How do you view the policy landscape here as there are questions on whether Amazon and Flipkart are compliant with rules in letter and spirit or not?

Is allowing an inventory based model for Flipkart something that Walmart would seek?

Would you be interested in brick & mortar stores in India if FDI rules permit?

Is that also because of the changing nature of consumers? Given that Amazon is overtaking in terms of revenue, how are you addressing that?

Is it a level-playing field given the rules allow an inventory based model for Indian companies?

Walmart president and CEO Doug McMillon doesn't mince words. In an interview, McMillon (59), who oversaw the US retail giant's acquisition of a controlling stake in Flipkart in 2018 in a $16-billion deal, tells TOI that the company seeks a level-playing field in the countries it operates, that would mean opening up the inventory based model to foreign e-commerce players in India like Walmart and Amazon, which local rules prohibit. He also says that Walmart is no longer chasing the brick-and-mortar stores business in India. Excerpts from the interaction with McMillon and Walmart International president & CEO Kathryn McLay:Doug McMillon: We are doing everything we can to keep our prices as low as possible for as long as possible. Sourcing out of India is important to us. We have a long-term view. We will balance the various pressures.McMillon: There are many benefits to buying close to where your demand is... you can create more jobs, have less lead time. More than two-thirds of what we sell in the US is made, grown or assembled in the US. Whether it's in the US or Mexico or other countries, we try to first and foremost to buy in that country...Kathryn McLay: We learned during Covid that if you had over-reliance on any particular trade route, then it could be very disruptive. So, for the last five years, we have been looking at building a resilient supply chain. Sourcing from India is a great option for us and it's a great option for India.McMillon: It has been good to see the breadth of categories expand. When we started here, we were buying a lot of soft goods. And now, we are buying food items, more general merchandise categories other than just in-home. What we see in India is that we can buy all kinds of things. We hope that the diversification of the manufacturing base in India continues.McLay: When the Flipkart team decided to move to quick commerce, they moved with speed. Not only have they got really strong plans around roll out, but they continue to blow our minds in regards to the speed - to do a delivery in minutes.McLay: We have always said that we are interested in making sure that we are positioned around growth and market share, and delighting the customers before we are focus on profits. Obviously, we need to make profits but we kind of think about it in that order. Flipkart's in this wonderful position of having access to 500 million customers.McMillon: Our job one is to be compliant. That's our focus. Job two is to communicate to everybody what we see that would help us to be able to serve customers better and what we think rules could look like that would help support the economy. We communicate with this govt and other govts all the time with regards to that.McMillon: We like managing inventory, managing inventory is difficult but it's one of the areas where we have expertise. Hopefully, at some point, that will happen.McMillon: That's not something we are pursuing. We have learnt that that's very difficult. We are very excited to have invested in Flipkart.McMillon: Around the world, e-commerce has been growing and continues to grow. But particularly in India, the e-commerce business has a really bright future; Flipkart has a really bright future and I am really thankful that we made the investment when we did.McMillon: The rules aren't up to us.

I want two things to be remembered. Given our system of things, we seek Parliamentary approval for deciding on the tariff rate... the permission to go up to a certain level, but effectively you are at a far lower level,"" she said at an event organised by Exim Bank.US President Donald Trump repeatedly referred to India as a ""tariff king"" for maintaining ""very high"" duties on farm and industrial products, such as automobiles and whiskey. Govt officials maintained that even the rates approved by Parliament are much lower than the bound rate, or the rate committed to the WTO.While the FM noted that negotiations for trade deals with the EU and the US were moving at a fast pace and could be concluded soon, she sought to highlight the reforms on reducing the number of tariff rates to eight in the last Budget.""So, for those of us who still think there is still a tariff story in India, I want this to be clear, there are only just eight (tariff rates) including the zero rate.So, we have done a lot of reforms in reducing the burden on trade by cutting down tariffs to support manufacturing and value addition, promote exports, and facilitate trade."" Following the changes in the Budget, the average customs duty rate dropped to 10.7% from 11.7%.Coming on the back of trade deals with the UK and the European Free Trade Association, the new trade deals are expected to open new markets for Indian exporters. The FM said that Indian exports fared well despite global challenges. Observing that exporters are ""swimming against tides,"" she assured all support and urged them to focus on innovation and finding newer markets for their products.""India is not just about exporting raw foods or commodities. It is exporting today well-engineered products, which meet high standards,"" Sitharaman said.","US President Donald Trump repeatedly referred to India as a ""tariff king"" for maintaining ""very high"" duties on farm and industrial products.

There will be no increase in fare for suburban tickets, monthly passes and second-class travel for 500 km.The govt will take a call on the notification in a few days, although a section within the govt is of the view that it will be a tough decision before elections in Bihar and Bengal.

Gold price prediction today: Gold is in focus with heightened geopolitical tensions between Iran and Israel and with the US bombing nuclear facilities in Iran. Will gold prices resume a conclusive upward trend amidst growing global uncertainties?Gold prices remained volatile throughout last week, hovering around the ₹1 lakh mark domestically, as geopolitical tensions between Israel and Iran escalated, boosting safe-haven demand.Despite this, gold’s upward momentum was capped by a firm dollar, which was hovering slightly below 100. Investors are closely monitoring the US Federal Reserve’s policy stance after it left interest rates unchanged while signalling a more gradual rate cut path ahead. Fed Chair Jerome Powell emphasized caution, citing stable unemployment and expectations of rising inflation due to tariffs. Markets are pricing in rate cuts totalling 50 bps in 2025, but less aggressive easing for 2026–27.Meanwhile, US data revealed weaker-than-expected retail sales and industrial production, indicating potential economic softness, though jobless claims were lower, suggesting resilience in the labor market. Market participants now await Powell’s upcoming testimony and key economic indicators including preliminary PMIs, GDP, consumer confidence, and the PCE price index.In global developments, China’s central bank held steady on its loan prime rates, adding pressure to industrial metals. Domestically, silver saw some profit booking from all-time highs. Despite tensions and US intervention in the Iran-Israel conflict, Iran' s stance on Strait of Hormus is very important for further direction in the market.","Gold prices remained volatile throughout last week, hovering around the ₹1 lakh mark domestically.

ITR e-filing FY 2024-25: Which Form For Gig Workers?

Importantly, ITR-1 and ITR-2 do not apply to income from freelancing or gig work. Selecting the correct form is crucial for smooth return processing and to avoid errors or compliance notices.

Freelancers maintaining books of accounts and claiming actual business expenses should file ITR-3 .

. Alternatively, those in specified professions—such as legal, accounting, or technical consultancy etc—with gross receipts up to Rs 50 lakh (or Rs 75 lakh if cash receipts do not exceed 5% of the total gross receipts) may opt for ITR-4 under the presumptive taxation scheme. Under the presumptive taxation scheme, 50% of gross receipts are deemed taxable, simplifying compliance by eliminating the need for detailed bookkeeping.

Türkiye: Avoid Southeast, maintain low profile

Lebanon: Non-essential staff ordered to depart

The United States has issued a sweeping global security alert for its citizens following its military strikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities. The State Department warned of potential reprisals against Americans, and ordered the departure of non-essential diplomatic staff from Lebanon, while also issuing specific advisories for Türkiye and Saudi Arabia.The US missile strikes which President Donald Trump claimed had “completely and fully obliterated” Iran’s nuclear facilities have provoked fierce threats from Tehran, which has vowed a “proportionate response” at a time and place of its choosing. With Israeli air raids continuing deep into Iranian territory and Tehran’s Revolutionary Guard launching retaliatory missile attacks, fears of a prolonged confrontation have grown.Iran has signalled that US military bases and regional allies could be targeted if used in attacks against it. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei’s advisor Ali Akbar Velayati warned that “any country used by the US to strike Iran will be a legitimate target for our armed forces.”“The Department of State advises US citizens worldwide to exercise increased caution,” the alert read. In light of “disruptions to travel and periodic closure of airspace across the Middle East,” and the potential for demonstrations against US citizens, travellers were urged to consult the most recent travel advisories and country-specific information.The warning directs citizens to visit the Department’s website for up-to-date guidance and security alerts.The US Embassy in Türkiye has cautioned its personnel to avoid the consular district of Adana in the country’s southeast, encompassing 22 provinces. “Negative sentiment toward US foreign policy may prompt actions against US or Western interests,” the alert said, citing risks of demonstrations, graffiti, boycotts and anti-American rhetoric.Americans in Türkiye were advised to avoid protest areas, monitor local media, and “exercise caution and stay alert at locations publicly associated with the United States or Israel or frequented by Westerners.”In Beirut, the State Department on ordered the departure of non-emergency government staff and family members due to a “volatile and unpredictable security situation.” While flights remain operational at Rafic Hariri International Airport, the embassy noted that “some airlines have suspended or cancelled flights,” urging citizens to monitor news updates and leave while commercial options are still available.“We remind US citizens to continue to exercise caution,” the embassy said, stressing the uncertain and rapidly evolving nature of the conflict.The US Mission to Saudi Arabia issued a separate advisory warning American citizens and its own staff to “limit non-essential travel to any military installations in the region.” The alert acknowledged the fluid situation following Israel’s military campaign and the US strikes, urging Americans to prepare personal emergency plans and review existing travel arrangements.“Crises can happen unexpectedly while travelling or living abroad, and a good plan helps you think through potential scenarios,” it added, with assurances that embassy staffing and consular services remain unaffected for now.The alerts come as Washington’s intervention in Israel’s war with Iran escalates regional instability. Israeli forces continued their aerial bombardment of Iranian targets on Sunday, hitting missile sites and infrastructure in Tehran, Hamedan and Kermanshah. Iran’s response has included launching long-range missiles at Israel and threatening further escalation.Iran’s UN ambassador accused the US of “destroying diplomacy,” while other officials insisted that Iran’s nuclear programme though damaged was not completely halted. “Even if nuclear sites are destroyed, game isn’t over,” wrote Ali Shamkhani, another advisor to Khamenei.","U.S. State Department issues global security alert for its citizens. Warns of potential reprisals against Americans, and orders departure of non-essential staff from Lebanon. Issues specific advisories for Türkiye and Saudi Arabia.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122013472,imgsize-1679256,width-400,resizemode-4/122013472.jpg"
Market pulse: Asian stocks steady; oil prices slide further as Israel-Iran ceasefire holds,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/market-pulse-asian-stocks-steady-oil-prices-slide-further-as-israel-iran-ceasefire-holds/articleshow/122059354.cms,"Representative image (Picture credit: AP)

Asian stocks held firm on Wednesday while oil prices lingered near multi-week lows, as a tentative ceasefire between Israel and Iran continued to support investor sentiment, reported news agency Reuters.Though risks of renewed hostilities remain, the fragile truce has helped soothe market nerves after weeks of geopolitical turbulence.Japan’s Nikkei and Australia’s ASX 200 were little changed, while Taiwan’s Taiex gained 1 per cent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 0.6 per cent and Chinese blue-chip stocks dipped 0.1 per cent.Broader market sentiment was steady, with the MSCI world stock index hovering near record highs.The positive momentum was underpinned by easing oil prices.Brent crude fell nearly 7 per cent to $67.14 per barrel, while US benchmark West Texas Intermediate dropped 6 per cent to $64.37, extending Tuesday’s losses, reported news agency AFP.This marks two consecutive days of steep declines as markets reacted to signs that oil supply routes in the Middle East remain unaffected. Analysts said the fall was also driven by US President Donald Trump’s claim that China may resume buying Iranian oil, further easing fears of a supply crunch.""The de-escalation seems to be doing better,"" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B Riley Wealth, as quoted by AFP. Crude prices, now below pre-conflict levels, are seen as reducing inflationary risks and could open space for central banks to consider interest rate cuts.The drop in oil prices also pushed US Treasury yields lower. The 10-year yield fell to 4.29 per cent, and the two-year yield slipped to 3.81 per cent, signalling rising expectations of a policy pivot, reported AP.On Wall Street, stocks continued their rebound on Tuesday. The S&P 500 rose 1.1 per cent, the Dow gained 1.2 per cent, and the Nasdaq jumped 1.4 per cent, placing all three indices within reach of their all-time highs.European markets also rallied, with Paris and Frankfurt posting solid gains, though London closed flat due to losses in oil majors.In currency markets, the dollar weakened, falling 0.1 per cent to 144.70 yen, while the euro rose to $1.1625, its highest level since October 2021. The euro/pound exchange dropped to 85.24 pence from 85.60 pence.With energy costs easing and geopolitical risks contained for now, markets appear to be pricing in a smoother path ahead, though investors remain cautious of any flare-up that could reverse the recent optimism.","Japan's Nikkei and Australia's ASX 200 were little changed on Wednesday.

(AI image)

Imagine a 15 hour flight that leads you - nowhere! That’s the plight of passengers on a recent Qantas Airways flight, which flew for 15 hours, only to return to its place of origin. Travellers on a Qantas Airways Ltd. flight to Paris experienced an unusual situation when their aircraft returned to Australia after spending over 15 hours airborne.The diversion occurred due to Iranian missile strikes that resulted in extensive airspace closures across the Middle East region.According to a Bloomberg report, the Boeing Co. 787 aircraft commenced its scheduled 17-hour journey from Perth at 7.35 p.m. local time on Monday. However, on reaching the south-western borders of Indian airspace, the airline received notification about the missile attack. This development necessitated the aircraft's return to Perth, where it touched down safely at approximately 11 a.m. on Tuesday.The Perth-London Heathrow service operated by Qantas was similarly impacted, necessitating a diversion to Singapore, according to the airline's official statement.Qantas Airways arranged overnight accommodation for travellers on both services. These route changes have implications for subsequent flights returning from London and Paris, with Qantas actively exploring solutions for impacted customers.The carrier confirmed its commitment to continuously assess available airspace and implement various flight routes for European services, taking into consideration both weather conditions and security circumstances.Qantas's direct services to Europe departing from Perth regularly traverse the Middle East airspace, and occasionally have needed to take extended diversions to avoid restricted zones or make refuelling stops in Singapore.The US military intervention in Israel's conflict with Iran has led to widespread travel chaos globally this week, with flights still being cancelled on Tuesday, despite President Donald Trump's announcement of an active ceasefire.After Trump authorised unprecedented strikes on three Iranian military and nuclear facilities during the weekend, Iran retaliated on Monday with a restricted missile offensive targeting American forces stationed at Qatar's Al Udeid Air Base. Qatar swiftly denounced the assault, having shut its airspace merely hours before the incident.According to an AP report, regional airports and aviation routes have remained tense since June 13, when Israel initiated the lethal conflict through unexpected attacks on Iran, which subsequently countered with missile and drone operations.In the aftermath of the US military action, an increasing number of airlines suspended their services, particularly in Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, situated directly across the Persian Gulf from Iran.Following the ceasefire declaration between Israel and Iran, certain disruptions showed signs of improvement. However, the stability of the agreement came into question on Tuesday when Trump pointed out violations by both nations. Several airlines opted to suspend specific routes until mid-week due to safety considerations.The aviation sector in the Middle East experienced significant impact, with numerous carriers facing substantial cancellations and delays throughout the week.","Passengers on a Qantas Airways flight to Paris experienced an unusual situation when their aircraft returned to Australia after spending over 15 hours airborne.

Indian EB-5 investors take USCIS to court over ‘unlawful’ denial of application,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/indian-eb-5-investors-take-uscis-to-court-over-unlawful-denial-of-application/articleshow/122051832.cms,"Representative image

A group of Indian nationals who collectively invested hundreds of thousands of dollars into the US economy under the EB-5 Immigrant Investor Program (commonly referred to as the investment-linked green card) have sued the head of the US government office overseeing the program, alleging unlawful denial of their applications and failure to implement investor protections mandated by law.The lawsuit, filed in a US District Court (Northern District of California) lists seven plaintiffs—Indian citizens living in California, New York, and India—who invested in a pooled fund managed by the now defunct Texas EB-5 Regional Center. The suit names Alissa Emmel, Chief of the Immigrant Investor Program Office at US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), as the sole defendant.At the heart of the dispute is the plaintiffs’ contention that USCIS failed to honour provisions of the EB-5 Reform and Integrity Act of 2022 (RIA). The Act was passed by the US Congress to shield ‘good faith’ EB-5 investors from fallout when regional centers or project sponsors failed to comply with program requirements or became defunct. This lawsuit is perhaps the first of its kind following the passage of the RIA.Under the EB-5 route currently an investment of $800,000 for projects in Target Employment Areas (TEAs) - which are rural and high-unemployment areas or for infrastructure projects; or an investment of $1,050,000 in other cases, entitles the investor to a green-card comparatively quickly.For Indians, caught in a decades long backlog for an employment-linked green card, this route is a quicker option – if they have the money to make the investment required under the EB-5 program.In addition, to the investment, job creation of at least ten local jobs is required. Investments can be made either directly (such as by operating a business) or indirectly via regional centers, which in turn invest in commercial enterprises which initiate specific projects – such as building a hotel. A significant number of investors opt for the regional center route.According to the lawsuit-complaint, the Texas-based regional center failed to pay statutorily required fees and did not file the required annual compliance forms. Under the RIA, such noncompliance should have triggered an automatic termination of the center within 90 days. However, USCIS allegedly took no action until more than a year later—following a separate lawsuit filed by another investor.Because USCIS delayed the termination of the regional center and failed to notify investors as required, the plaintiffs argue they were wrongly denied the opportunity to amend their EB-5 petitions or re-associate with compliant projects—a key protection offered under the RIA. Instead, each of their applications (Form I-526 petitions)—filed between 2019 and 2020—were summarily denied in 2024. The lawsuit states that USCIS violated the Administrative Procedure Act by unlawfully withholding agency action and failing to follow statutory procedures.Beyond the legal claims, the lawsuit-complaint documents personal hardships that the plaintiffs had to bear: missed career opportunities, financial hardship, and emotional distress stemming from prolonged uncertainty. Some have lived in the US for years on temporary visas and were hoping for permanent residency through the EB-5 route. Others, who are in India are unable to plan their futures.One plaintiff, based in California holding an H-1B visa, described the strain of being laid-off and the difficulty in finding suitable employment opportunities without a green card. Owing to his temporary non-immigrant visa status, he also pointed out that it was difficult to travel to India to attend marriages or even funerals. Another plaintiff, based in Santa Clara, said he passed up several career advancement opportunities due to the instability of his immigration status and also put his dream of home-ownership on hold.For plaintiffs still residing in India, the story was similar. Two of the petitioners from Gujarat said they had turned down business opportunities and now faced uncertainty about both professional prospects and personal plans.In their lawsuit-complaint, these plaintiffs submitted that USCIS’s inaction undermines Congressional intent behind the 2022 reform, which was specifically designed to prevent immigrant investors from losing their immigration prospects due to failures beyond their control. Despite public USCIS statements that pre-RIA investors are eligible for protections, the plaintiffs say the agency has failed to apply those principles in practice.Alexandra George Santhanam, Associate Attorney at The Galati Law Firm, which is representing these investors, stated, “Plaintiffs each invested hundreds of thousands of dollars in the U.S. economy. They did everything in their power to apply for permanent residency in good faith. USCIS ignored the duties imposed upon it by Congress. Because of that, their American Dream is now dead. This is an injustice that the Court has the power to address and order the Defendant to remedy. ”Plaintiffs are asking the court to declare USCIS’ inaction unlawful, reopen their EB-5 petitions, and provide the written notices necessary to reinvest their capital and continue their immigration processes.The lawsuit may test how seriously US immigration authorities are held to their own statutory obligations—and whether the ‘American Dream’ that the EB-5 investors were sold can be salvaged by court intervention.",Group of Indian nationals who collectively invested hundreds of thousands of dollars into the US economy under the EB-5 Immigrant Investor Program have sued the head of the US government office overseeing the program. They allege unlawful denial of their applications and failure to implement investor protections mandated by law. This lawsuit is perhaps the first of its kind following the passage of the RIA.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122051839,imgsize-593870,width-400,resizemode-4/122051839.jpg"
"US markets today: Wall Street nears record high as oil slides on Israel-Iran ceasefire; crypto, travel stocks rally",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-stock-market-today-wall-street-nasdaq-dow-jones-sp-500-crude-oil-prices-israel-iran-ceasefire/articleshow/122050726.cms,"(With inputs from AP)

Wall Street surged on Tuesday with the S&P 500 coming within 1% of its all-time high, as global markets cheered the announcement of a ceasefire between Israel and Iran. The optimism sent oil prices tumbling and lifted equities across sectors, with travel, crypto and tech stocks among the top gainers.At 12:47 pm ET, the S&P 500 was up 1.1%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 517 points or 1.2%, and the Nasdaq rose 1.5%. The gains mirrored a broader rally across global markets, where stocks in Europe and Asia posted gains of over 1% following President Donald Trump’s announcement of a “complete and total ceasefire” between the two warring nations.The biggest market reaction came from crude oil, with US benchmark prices dropping 6.1% to $64.33 per barrel, and Brent crude slipping 6.1% to $66.21. Oil is now trading below pre-conflict levels as fears of supply disruption faded. Analysts said Iran’s retaliatory strike on Monday avoided targeting key oil infrastructure, and Trump confirmed the truce was holding, easing concerns over a blockade of the Strait of Hormuz — a critical chokepoint for global oil.“Oil prices are falling rapidly, and with the global market well supplied and OPEC+ continuing to ramp up output, we may see further declines if the ceasefire endures,” Carsten Fritsch, commodities analyst at Commerzbank, said, as quoted AP.Falling oil prices are expected to ease inflationary pressures, potentially giving the US Federal Reserve room to consider rate cuts. However, Fed Chair Jerome Powell, testifying before Congress on Tuesday, reiterated a cautious stance, stating the central bank is “well positioned to wait to learn more about the likely course of the economy before considering any adjustments to our policy stance.”While Powell said rate cuts could come “sooner rather than later,” he added, “I wouldn’t want to point to a particular meeting. I don’t think we need to be in any rush because the economy is still strong.”Trump, who has repeatedly called for aggressive rate cuts, renewed his pressure earlier in the day, criticising Powell and urging the Fed Board to act to support growth.Bond yields reflected the uncertainty. The 10-year US Treasury yield dipped to 4.29% from 4.34% a day earlier, while the two-year yield fell to 3.81% from 3.84%.On Wall Street, Carnival Corp jumped 6.8% after reporting a stronger-than-expected quarterly profit and raising its full-year forecast. CEO Josh Weinstein said demand for near-term cruise bookings remained robust.Uber Technologies rose 8.2% after announcing that users in Atlanta can now hail rides in Waymo autonomous vehicles through its app, while Coinbase rallied 10.7% as bitcoin crossed the $105,000 mark.Global stock indices also surged following the ceasefire. France’s CAC 40, Germany’s DAX, and Japan’s Nikkei gained over 1%, while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng jumped 2.1% and South Korea’s KOSPI rose 3%.","The S&P 500 was up 1.1%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 517 points or 1.2%, and the Nasdaq rose 1.5%.

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank will maintain a cautious stance on interest rates and await more data before considering cuts—directly opposing President Donald Trump ’s fresh demands for immediate rate reductions.“For the time being, we are well positioned to wait to learn more about the likely course of the economy before considering any adjustments to our policy stance,” Powell said in prepared testimony to be delivered Tuesday before the House Financial Services Committee, reported AP.Powell’s remarks come as he begins two days of potentially contentious hearings on Capitol Hill, where lawmakers will question him about monetary policy, inflation, and the economy—amid growing political pressure.In a social media post early Tuesday, Trump lashed out at Powell again, writing, “Too Late' Jerome Powell, of the Fed, will be in Congress today in order to explain, among other things, why he is refusing to lower the Rate.

"Global central banks shift from dollar to gold and euro, says OMFIF survey, as Trump’s tariffs shake safe-haven appeal",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/global-central-banks-shift-from-dollar-to-gold-and-euro-says-omfif-survey-as-trumps-tariffs-shake-safe-haven-appeal/articleshow/122047297.cms,"AI image

Global central banks managing around $5 trillion in reserves are preparing to reduce their reliance on the US dollar, turning instead to gold, the euro and China’s yuan, according to a survey by the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum (OMFIF).The OMFIF survey, conducted between March and May across 75 central banks, found that a net 33% of reserve managers plan to increase their gold holdings over the next one to two years—the highest reading in at least five years.“After years of record-high central bank gold purchases, reserve managers are doubling down on the precious metal,” OMFIF stated, as quoted by Reuters.The shift comes in the wake of US President Donald Trump’s sweeping April 2 “Liberation Day” tariffs, which triggered market turmoil and weakened the dollar’s safe-haven appeal. As per the survey, 70% of central banks said the US political environment was discouraging them from investing in the greenback, more than double the share from a year ago.The dollar, which topped last year’s currency preference list, fell to seventh place in the 2025 rankings. Meanwhile, a net 16% of central banks plan to increase euro holdings over the next 12–24 months, followed by the yuan. Over a decade, the yuan’s share of global reserves is expected to triple to 6%, with a net 30% of central banks planning to raise their exposure.Reserve managers also expressed optimism about the euro regaining ground lost since the 2011 sovereign debt crisis. Citing improved sentiment, three sources familiar with central bank strategy told Reuters that the euro could recover to a 25% reserve share by 2030, from around 20% now.UBS Asset Management's Max Castelli said many central banks reached out after Trump’s tariff announcement to ask if the dollar’s haven status was in question. “As far as I remember, this question has never been asked before—not even during the 2008 financial crisis,” Castelli told Reuters.The average projected share of the dollar in global FX reserves by 2035 was 52%, down from its current 58%, according to the OMFIF survey.Harvard professor and former IMF chief economist Kenneth Rogoff told Reuters via email, “The euro’s share of global reserves will almost surely rise over the next few years, not so much because Europe is viewed more favourably, but because the dollar’s status is diminished.”Bernard Altschuler, global head of central bank coverage at HSBC, said the euro is the “only real alternative currency” to the dollar at present and added that a 25% reserve share is realistic within 2–3 years, provided the EU expands its bond markets and integrates capital markets more deeply.Francesco Papadia, senior fellow at think tank Bruegel and former ECB market operations chief, also told Reuters that reserve managers are increasingly open to holding more euros. Zhou Xiaochuan, former governor of the People’s Bank of China, added that the euro’s reserve status can grow but noted Europe still has “homework to do”.Europe's efforts to reduce US dependence—such as higher joint defence spending and capital market reforms—could accelerate the currency shift. Public pension and sovereign wealth funds surveyed also rated Germany as the most attractive developed market for investments.The Reuters report also noted that the dollar’s declining appeal is being closely watched by policymakers amid the broader reshaping of global trade, financial flows and geopolitical alignments.","Survey by Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum (OMFIF) found 33% of reserve managers plan to increase their gold holdings over the next one to two years. 70% of central banks said the US political environment was discouraging them from investing in the greenback, more than double the share from a year ago.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122047721,imgsize-879871,width-400,resizemode-4/122047721.jpg"

(AI image)

US President Donald Trump has targeted US Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, calling him ‘incompetent’. Trump has in the past hit out at Powell for not cutting rates, calling him a ‘numbskull’ and Mr ‘Too Late’.During the Federal Reserve's meeting last week, seven out of 19 officials involved in the bank's interest-rate decisions favoured maintaining current rates throughout this year, whilst two officials suggested a single reduction.Despite economists' widespread concerns that Trump's tariffs would drive up costs, inflation has consistently decreased this year. According to government data released last week, the consumer price index showed a minimal rise of 0.1% between April and May, indicating subdued price pressures. Although certain goods experienced price increases last month, reduced costs in service sectors like aviation and accommodation counterbalanced any effects from tariffs.In his latest salvo against Powell, Donald Trump posted on social media platform Truth Social, ““Too Late” Jerome Powell, of the Fed, will be in Congress today in order to explain, among other things, why he is refusing to lower the Rate. Europe has had 10 cuts, we have had ZERO.No inflation, great economy - We should be at least two to three points lower. Would save the USA 800 Billion Dollars Per Year, plus.

Asian shares climbed on Tuesday while oil prices dropped, as investor fears of a major energy shock eased following US President Donald Trump 's announcement of a ceasefire between Iran and Israel.Markets were reassured after Iran did not retaliate to a US strike on its nuclear facilities by disrupting oil transport through the Strait of Hormuz. Instead, Iran launched missiles at a major US base in Qatar, which later said the situation was stable. Analysts noted that oilfield assets were unaffected.""Tehran played it cool. Their 'retaliation' hit a US base in Qatar- loud enough for headlines, quiet enough not to shake the oil market's foundations,"" said Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management.He added that the perceived de-escalation caused the ""war premium"" to fall sharply, with Brent and WTI crude both sliding more than seven percent overnight.On Tuesday, both contracts continued to decline, with Brent down 2.2 per cent at $69.24 per barrel and West Texas Intermediate falling 2.3 per cent to $66.19.Asian stock markets reacted positively. Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index both rose 1.4 per cent, Shanghai’s Composite gained 0.8 per cent, and Seoul’s Kospi jumped 2.7 per cent.Singapore added 0.7 per cent, Sydney rose 1.1 per cent, and Taipei was up 1.8 per cent. However, Jakarta bucked the trend, falling 1.7 per cent.Trump said Iran and Israel had agreed to a staggered ceasefire aimed at officially ending their conflict, though airstrikes were still ongoing in Tehran. Iran’s foreign minister said Tuesday that Tehran would not continue strikes if Israel halted its attacks.""Details of the ceasefire agreement are still sparse at the time of writing and as such the detente and de-escalation is not a done deal,"" said Michael Wan of MUFG. Still, he noted that reports suggest Iran has agreed to the ceasefire, which reduced the risk of extreme scenarios affecting global oil supply.In currency markets, the dollar weakened after Federal Reserve governor Michelle Bowman said she would support a rate cut at the Fed's July meeting if inflation remains steady. The market currently expects the next rate cut in September. Bowman pointed to ongoing tariff negotiations and a less risky economic outlook as factors supporting policy easing.","Asian shares climbed on Tuesday while oil prices dropped, as investor fears of a major energy shock eased following US President Donald Trump's announcement of a ceasefire between Iran and Israel.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran Udaan until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.Udaan built an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business still accounts for a very small part of India’s overall retail market but can balloon to $150 billion in sales and yield a 100% return on capital invested in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co. estimates published in the Mint newspaper.Bengaluru-based Udaan has also ventured into financing through its fintech unit which helps shopkeepers get working capital loans to buy inventory. That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says.

How India's GDP has been growing

What SBI report said on savings and investment

Incremental capital output ratio

NEW DELHI: India's gross domestic product (GDP) data for the third quarter (October-December 2022) received a word of caution from the former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan In an interview with news agency PTI, Rajan that India is ""dangerously close"" to the Hindu rate of growth in view of subdued private sector investment, high interest rates and slowing global growth.India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying"".However, a report released by the State Bank of India (SBI) economists on Tuesday dismissed arguments that India is dangerously close to Hindu rate of growth saying such statements are ""ill-conceived, biased and premature"".The term 'Hindu growth rate' was coined by late economist Raj Krishna in 1978 to describe the slow growth in the country.It basically refers to the low pace of economic growth rates during 1950s to 1980s. During this period, the Indian economy averaged 3.5%.A former lecturer at the Delhi School of Economics (DSE), Krishna noted that only if the rate of growth is persistently slow and accompanied by low per-capita GDP, then it will be known as Hindu rate of growth but it has to factor in population growth as well.Before economic reforms of 1991, India's economic growth remained stagnant and low, while per capita income averaged around 1.3%. Krishna termed this low growth situation to be a result of socialist policies of state control and import substitution.However, the economic situation changed when liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation (LPG) reforms came into effect in the year 1991, at a time when India faced balance of payment crisis.Over the years, many economists have strongly opposed the idea of 'Hindu growth rate' and the term never had universal acceptance.The Indian economy plunged into its very first technical recession in FY21 due to the impact of Covid-19 pandemic and the related nationwide lockdowns. GDP shrunk by an unprecedented 23.8% in the first quarter of the financial year 2020-21. However, due to spurt in economic activities in the subsequent quarters, the GDP decline started to narrow.However, if we look at the period before Covid-19 as well, India's growth curve shows a declining trend.From 8.26% in FY17, GDP growth plunged to 3.74% in FY20. Shutdown of economic activities in FY21 in wake of Covid-19 only made matters worse.As lockdowns started to ease and business activities resumed, India's GDP also started rising. In Q1 of FY22, growth jumped to 20.1% mainly on account of low base effect. By the fourth quarter of FY22, growth came down to 4.10%.Similarly, the new financial year 2022-23 brought fresh economic challenges in the form of Russia-Ukraine war that impacted almost all major economies of the world, slowed the pace of growth, pushed inflation to record highs.As a result, the central banks of all advanced economies spurred into action and opted for monetary policy tightening to curb the soaring inflation.With persistently rising interest rates, India's economy grew by 4.4% in Q3 of FY23, as the Centre revised upwards GDP growth for previous year to 9.10% from 8.7% earlier.The report weighed recent GDP numbers against the available data on savings and investments for the past decade and highlighted some interesting points.""Quarterly growth numbers are noisy and should be best avoided for any serious interpretation (on an average, India's GDP growth has witnessed Rs 2 lakh crore upward revision for the 3 year ended FY23),"" the report said.Gross capital formation (GCF) by the government touched a high of 11.8% in 2021-22, up from 10.7% in 2020-21.""This also had a domino effect on private sector investment that jumped from 10 per cent to 10.8% over the same period,"" it said.In fact, Ecowrap added that the trends in GCF to gross output ratio or the plough back of funds for creation of fresh capacity shows that for public administration the ratio attained fresh peak in 2021-22 owing to the emphasis on capital expenditure in recent budgets.At the aggregate level, gross capital formation is supposed to have crossed 32% in 2022-23, the highest level since 2018-19.According to the report, in 2021-22, gross savings have risen to 30% from 29% in 2020-21.""The ratio is supposed to have crossed 31 per cent in 2022-23, the highest since 2018-19. The household savings increased sharply during the pandemic period on account of sharp accretion in financial savings such as deposits,"" said the report by SBI's Economic Research Department.While household financial savings have since then moderated from 15.4% in 2020-21 to 11.1% in 2022-23, savings in physical assets have grown sharply to 11.8% in 2021-22 from 10.7% in 2020-21.The report further analysed Incremental Capital Output ratio (ICOR) -- which measures additional units of capital (investment) needed to produce additional units of output. It said that the ratio has been improving.""ICOR which was 7.5 in FY 12 is now only 3.5 in FY22. Clearly, only half of capital is now needed for next unit of output,"" the report noted.Such reducing ICOR in the current years reflects a relatively increasing efficiency of capital and shows that the economy is on a sound footing, the report said.""From that point of view, future GDP growth rates even at 7% could still mean a decent number by any standards!,"" it added.","India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.

An employee is entitled for a 50 per cent amount of the last drawn salary as pension.OPS was discontinued by the NDA government in 2003 with effect from April 1, 2004.Under the new pension scheme (NPS), employees contribute 10 per cent of their basic salary towards pension while the government contributes 14 per cent.Governments of Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand have informed the central government/ Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA about their decision to restart OPS for their employees.The government of Punjab on November 18, 2022, issued a notification regarding implementation of OPS for the state government employees who are being covered under NPS. Jharkhand too has decided to revert to OPS.",Former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan has expressed his concern over the decision of some states to restart the old pension scheme.

The meeting was chaired by Food Secretary Sanjeev Chopra.Out of the total wheat procurement target for the 2022-23 marketing year (April-March), Punjab will aim to procure 2.5 million tonnes wheat, Haryana 1.5 million tonnes and Madhya Pradrsh 2 million tonnes, the food ministry said in a statement.Wheat procurement had declined last year due to a fall in domestic production and higher exports.However, the government has projected a record wheat production at 112.18 million tonnes in the 2023-24 crop year (July-June) as per the second estimate of the agriculture ministry.Besides wheat, the government has also fixed rabi (winter) rice procurement target at 10.6 million tonnes in the 2022-23 marketing year.States have been advised to enhance rice milling capacity so that milling of one season gets completed before the commencement of next season and recycling of rice may be avoided.Whereas procurement of millets and coarse grains is estimated to be 7,50,000 tonnes this year, higher than 6,30,000 tonnes in 2021-22.

SBI customers take note of new scam! Imposters extorting money with these 7 steps,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sbi-customers-take-note-of-new-scam-imposters-extorting-money-with-these-7-steps/articleshow/115962047.cms,"Always authenticate the identity of the caller or sender. Legitimate organizations generally do not request sensitive information.

How the CBI, I-T imposter scam operates:

The first step to prevent falling prey to such frauds is to understand the modus operandi of scamsters. Vikram Babbar, Partner, EY Forensic & Integrity Services told ET explains how the fraud works:

Initiating the contact: The whole process begins with an imposter identifying any exploitable customer and contacting him/her through voice or video call, usually over messenger apps. The key element of the fraud is the bait that tricks the victim into believing the official has some critical information about them. This bait may include personal information like KYC number, address or any other information like assets etc.

Convincing the victim: The imposter then uses this information in such a way that the victim gets easily convinced. For example telling them about any property they bought and not paying the required tax for it. The fraudster may obtain this information from property websites where you have listed details, from a property broker’s website, or even from a data breach at the property registrar's office.

Narrating a fake story: Once the victim is convinced that the imposter is a genuine CBI or income tax official, the fraudster fabricates a story, claiming that the victim has evaded taxes or missed an important legal process, and therefore faces the possibility of arrest.

Falling into the trap: Hearing words like ""jail,"" ""arrest,"" and ""legal proceedings"" naturally triggers a sense of panic in people. The fraudster exploits this fear and panic to manipulate the victim into compliance.

Staging fake evidence: Meanwhile, the fraudster further ""stages"" the situation by scrutinizing fake documents and, in some cases, even simulating a police interrogation, pressurizing the victim into providing additional personal information, such as Aadhaar details, bank account numbers, and other sensitive data. This is then used by the scammers to easily access the victim’s bank account and other details.

Last nail in the coffin: The fraudster sets a well-planned trap that deceives numerous victims and once the victim believes the investigation will be lengthy, the fraudsters offer an escape route to the victim claiming that their innocence can only be confirmed after thorough verification. The victim is assured that the ‘official’ will take care of all legal, tax, and other issues, provided that the victim pays them a bribe and directs them to transfer money to multiple bank accounts throughout the investigation, with the promise that the funds will be refunded once the inquiry is completed.

How to avoid these frauds

Social engineering

Steps to prevent online frauds

Always authenticate the identity of the caller or sender. Legitimate organizations generally do not request sensitive information through phone calls, SMS, or video calls. Be cautious if someone threatens you with legal action or fines as genuine organizations typically communicate through official channels, allowing sufficient time for the victim to respond. Never share personal or financial information with anyone who contacts you unexpectedly. Report any suspicious messages to your bank and local law enforcement authorities. Enable security features such as two-factor authentication on your bank accounts and use strong, unique passwords for each service.

The State Bank of India has recently warned its customers about a new series of scams where imposters posing as CBI or Income Tax Department officials threaten people with a made up supposed legal action in order to extort money.It said, ""Dear SBI Customer, Fraudsters may pose as CBI or IT Dept officials and may threaten legal action or heavy fines to extort money from you. Beware of such frauds”.Also Read| PAN 2.0: Why you should apply for new PAN Card with QR code - top 5 benefits explained Shiksha Goel, who is an IPS, DGP CID & Women Safety Wing, director Telangana Cyber Security Bureau & Telangana FSL stated that no law enforcement agency or government body contacts consumers to conduct an investigation online, nor do they ask individuals to resolve legal matters through a video call.“In these cases the common narrative is to induce the fear of legal action on the victim for a made up incident and then extort money from them.”In case of receiving these kinds of threats, the victims must not be alarmed, instead ask the other person on the call to meet you at the nearest police station or government office.ET quoted Sheetal R Bhardwaj, executive member of Association of Certified Financial Crime Specialists (ACFCS) as saying, “This type of scam is commonly known as ""phishing"" or ""social engineering.Bhardwaj added that these scams have now become a major concern globally rather than India.“The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in the United States reports millions of dollars lost to fraud each year. Various studies indicate that billions of dollars are lost annually worldwide due to different types of financial fraud, and the problem is escalating as technology evolves and more people conduct transactions online,” she said.“If it's a genuine call then the other person will agree to meet you at the police station or government office.”Another tip she suggested was for consumers to disconnect the call and then dial the same number to return the call.""This is because, in our experience, we have seen these impostors use voice over internet protocol (VoIP) or other internet-based calling software, which typically doesn't allow incoming calls.""Also Read | Aadhaar card update: Deadline to update your Aadhaar details for free is approaching - here’s what you need to know Bharadwaj also shared some essential tips to safeguard and avoid this fraud",The State Bank of India has warned its customers about a new series of scams where imposters posing as CBI or Income Tax Department officials threaten people with a made up supposed legal action.

"PAN 2.0: With PAN Card going digital, will you need a physical PAN for KYC, ID proof?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/pan-2-0-with-pan-card-going-digital-will-you-need-a-physical-pan-for-kyc-id-proof/articleshow/115993942.cms,"PAN Card serves as both a tax identifier and physical identity proof.

How can PAN 2.0 possibly be different from the old PAN Card system?



Will physical PAN 2.0 be required?

PAN 2.0: With the Modi government announcing a comprehensive upgrade of the PAN infrastructure, taxpayers are wondering whether PAN 2.0 with enhanced QR code will be similar to m-Aadhaar or e-Aadhaar systems. Will PAN 2.0 feature dynamic QR codes for KYC, identity verification or address proof purposes?PAN Card serves as both a tax identifier and physical identity proof. Under the new PAN 2.0 project, the system is transitioning to digital format. The government has allocated Rs 1,435 crore for a comprehensive upgrade of the current PAN infrastructure. The government has said that PAN 2.0 will be an advanced version offering enhanced user convenience.Currently, PAN 1.0's electronic version has limited KYC application and cannot serve as address proof in any form. In contrast, Aadhaar remains valid for these purposes across all formats.Also Read | PAN 2.0 for free! How to get PAN Card with QR code with address update online; step-by-step guide The Ministry of Finance clarified in a press release dated November 26, 2024: ""Comprehensive use of technology for paperless processes: Complete online paperless process as against prevailing mode. Taxpayer facilitation: Allotment/updation/correction of PAN will be done free of cost and e-PAN will be sent to the registered mail id. For a physical PAN card, the applicant has to make a request along with the prescribed fee of Rs 50 (domestic). For delivery of cards outside India, Rs 15 + India post charges at actuals will be charged to the applicant.""Experts suggest that PAN 2.0 will likely support KYC procedures, identity verification and additional functions, similar to m-Aadhaar and e-Aadhaar capabilities.PAN verification alone might be insufficient for KYC requirements, though PAN 2.0 could alter this scenario, feel experts. Additional clarification is required regarding the dynamic QR code features of digital PAN 2.0 , particularly its capability to display residential information.""In its present form, PAN is necessary but not sufficient for KYC. It is not classified as an OVD (Officially Valid Document); rather it's a unique identifier used for tax and money laundering purposes. Apart from collecting PAN (i.e. the number) the regulated entity has to still collect an ID card (OVD). Aadhaar is a type of OVD,"" Wriju Ray, Chief Business Officer, IDfy told ET.According to Ankit Jain, partner at Ved Jain & Associates, financial institutions and employers typically require self-attested physical PAN copies, rather than accepting digital PAN 1.0 for new accounts, loans, or employment procedures.Rahul Jain from HSA Advocates suggests that whilst current PAN format doesn't fulfil KYC requirements, its Aadhaar linkage could enable KYC verification.Also Read | PAN 2.0: Why you should apply for new PAN Card with QR code - top 5 benefits explained ""As per my understanding, due to the linkage of the two documents (Aadhaar-PAN) there are high possibility that the government may decide that QR code provided in PAN 2.0 shall also contain the address proof of a person and in such a scenario PAN 2.0 will be sufficient for conducting KYC,"" Rahul Jain from HSA Advocates told ET.Regarding identification purposes, both digital versions of PAN can function as valid ID proof. Experts indicate that digital PAN 2.0 might suffice for most situations, potentially eliminating the need for physical cards.Ankit Jain shares his observations: ""Based on current experience, digital PAN is accepted at entry points of airports, hotels, trains etc. Digital PANs are also accepted while applying for GST registration, Director Identification Number, Company Registration, etc. The use of Digital PANs for these purposes would continue even in PAN 2.0.""The practical application determines whether digital PAN 2.0 will be adequate for your requirements.Physical cards may remain necessary for those without digital access, according to Dip Mehta, Partner, EY Forensic and Integrity Services.""For the foreseeable future, organizations will likely need to ensure that both digital and physical PAN formats are accommodated in their KYC workflows. Over time, as PAN 2.0's functionalities gain trust and widespread acceptance, reliance on physical cards should reduce significantly,"" he states.Ray from IDfy notes that banks currently require physical PAN presentation during video KYC, though ePAN is acceptable. ""In the case of video KYC, the applicant is required to show a PAN Card on the video call. In such cases ePAN is also allowed. Again, both formats shall continue and really there is no change whatsoever to the process based on the current release of PAN 2.0,"" he explains.","PAN Card serves as both a tax identifier and physical identity proof.

Myntra joins Q-commerce rush with 30-minute deliveries,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/myntra-joins-q-commerce-rush-with-30-minute-deliveries/articleshow/116026198.cms,"Myntra

MUMBAI: As more brands hop onto quick commerce platforms to reach a wider set of customers and tap into the growing instant shopping opportunity, it is nudging ecommerce companies to look the same way. Myntra is the latest to join the quick commerce rush. With its M-Now offering, it will provide users with faster deliveries of fashion and beauty products . To begin with, Myntra is targeting 30-minute deliveries to cater to young shoppers who are seeking new styles at the tap of their smartphones and faster doorstep delivery of fashion. In an interaction, CEO Nandita Sinha did not rule out the possibility of shortening delivery timelines going ahead, although she did not share any specifics. “The young Gen Z, millennial customers have a higher need for gratification which is quicker… their wardrobes are becoming very expansive and diverse and it is not just about a product but entire styling solutions. Their adoption (of M-Now) will be much faster,” Sinha told TOI.Myntra will use a network of third-party dark stores and offline stores of its brand partners to fulfil the deliveries as of now. The company’s foray into the quick commerce space comes at a time when consumers are subscribing to 10-minute rapid delivery to buy a range of non-grocery items, moving some amount of their e-commerce spends to quick commerce platforms and posing a challenge for players like Myntra. Of late, brands like Fabindia, Decathlon, Adidas, U.S. Polo Assn. and Paragon have introduced their selection on quick commerce platforms while several others are mulling adding quick commerce to their product distribution mix. “I think the big problem to be solved in fashion is getting the right selection in 30 minutes. Also, as we expand the network, we have to expand the logistics capabilities. That is new for us and that’s where we will put in the hard work,” Sinha said, adding that postpandemic, fashion shopping occasions have widened, pushing brands to do more.In India, quick commerce as a service started with rapid delivery of groceries but players soon expanded their selection to cover a range of nongrocery categories — ranging from electronic items and accessories, small kitchen appliances, toys, luggage bags to occasionally even iPhones. This has been nudging e-commerce firms to reduce their delivery timelines in general.","Myntra is the latest to join the quick commerce rush.

Cut GST on small bottles: Packaged water companies,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/cut-gst-on-small-bottles-packaged-water-companies/articleshow/116025991.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: It’s not just carbonated beverages that have hit the headlines over the proposed sin tax, packaged water is also now in focus.The packaged water industry feels encouraged by the potential GST rationalisation on 20 litre pack, but urged that it be extended to smaller sizes as well. In Oct, the GoM on GST rate rationalisation proposed lowering tax rates on packaged drinking water of 20 litres and above to 5% from existing 12%. If the GoM recommendation is accepted by the GST Council later this month, the GST rates would be reduced on the 20 litre packaged drinking water.Smaller pack sizes are taxed at a higher rate of 18%, as against the lower tax of 12% on 20 litre and above bottles. “The GST reduction would benefit more consumers if it is done on smaller packs of 1, 2 and 5 litres as these are consumed by families,’’ an industry representative told TOI, adding “we have heard that GoM recommendation could be accepted by the GST Council on Dec 22, hence the renewed appeal on small sizes.”In its recent representation to govt, the Indian Beverage Association (IBA) urged to lower GST rate to 5% saying that high rate of 18% means water is treated as a luxury item. The GST rates on water are comparable to other highly taxed beverages, though it’s a necessity.“Clean and safe drinking water is a scarce commodity and should be made available at an affordable price. The limited availability of affordable clean drinking water in India is a primary reason for the high vulnerability of the population to increasing waterborne diseases. The high cost of packaged water due to taxes and logistics hampers affordability. Further, low margins in business exacerbate the problem,” IBA said.","Smaller pack sizes are taxed at a higher rate of 18%, as against the lower tax of 12% on 20 litre and above bottles.

NEW DELHI: Chief economic advisor V Anantha Nageswaran on Thursday said economic activity in some sectors has picked up pace during Oct-Nov and a GDP growth of 6.5-7% in the current fiscal is feasible.He also said that the 5.4% Q2 GDP growth estimate could be revised upwards going forward, as current estimates are not seasonally adjusted.“I think in reacting to these numbers, I don’t think we should throw the baby out with the bathwater. Because the underlying growth story still remains very much intact,” Nageswaran said. India’s economic growth slowed to a seven-quarter low of 5.4% in the July-Sept quarter, from 6.7% in the April-June quarter.Nageswaran said the slowdown in GDP growth in the second quarter could be because of some “religious observances” in Sept and excess monsoon rainfall. It could also be because of other, more long-standing issues that are beginning to emerge. So explanations could be from mundane to more serious ones, he said, adding this is the first estimate for Q2 GDP growth. “It could be revised higher,” he said.He said that the Economic Survey had projected 6.5-7% for FY25. “To be able to hit 6.5% growth for the year as a whole, we need a 7% real GDP growth in the next two quarters of which, two months are already over in the third quarter. We are in the third month... I think it is doable if you look at some of these pickups that have happened in specific areas. So, I believe that a growth outcome in the range of 6.5-7% is feasible for the year,” Nageswaran said at an Assocham event. The Indian economy grew 8.2% in FY24.RBI had projected growth to be 7.2% in the current fiscal, higher than the 6.5-7% projected in the finance ministry’s Economic Survey.","Chief economic advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said economic activity in some sectors has picked up pace during Oct-Nov.

Trump tariffs: Government tries to identify areas of gain,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/trump-tariffs-government-tries-to-identify-areas-of-gain/articleshow/116026051.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: With Donald Trump threatening to impose additional duties against China and Mexico, government has launched a multi-pronged exercise, which seeks to identify areas where India can tap into an opportunity but is also keeping close tabs on currency movement.While the recent depreciation of rupee is seen to be helpful in making Indian goods more competitive, a lot will also depend on how other currencies move. Official sources told TOI that all eyes are on China as a steep depreciation of the yuan could help the Asian giant counter some of the impact of the additional tariffs that the Trump administration imposes.Since October-end, rupee has weakened around 0.7% against US dollar, while the Chinese currency has seen a near 2% depreciation. Several other currencies have weakened even more. The jury is, however, divided on the extent of China’s benefit from depreciation.While govt officials keep tabs on Trump’s next set of moves, they are breathing easy as India has not yet figured in the US president-elect’s trade war calculations. But, they are not ruling out the possibility of steps coming in the future, which many believe will be a negotiating strategy by the new US administration to get India to offer some concessions to American goods.For the moment, the commerce department is assessing sectors, where India can gain from actions being taken against China, as well as Chinese companies. Textiles, electronics goods and pharma are among sectors, where govt is assessing the capacity that manufacturers in India have and if they can ramp it up to tap into any opportunity in future. Sectors, such as textiles and garments, are seen to be especially lucrative as the recent tension in Bangladesh could also help Indian players.“We have seen an increase in mobile production in India, which is also catering to export demand. Similarly, there is a need to push the production of laptops and personal computers in In dia, which can also meet demand in other countries, especially as China faces pressure,” a senior official told TOI. India will, however, have to compete with countries such as Vietnam to grab a bigger share of the American pie.In last fiscal year, the US was India’s largest trading partner with bilateral trade of almost $120 billion. With exports of $77.5 billion, India had a trade surplus of over $35 billion, according to commerce department data. According to US data, India had the seventh highest trade surplus, with Trump’s recent threat focused on the top three countries with a favourable balance of trade – China, Mexico and Canada.Government officials have said goods trade numbers need to be looked at along with services, where the US enjoys significant advantages.","Since October-end, rupee has weakened around 0.7% against US dollar, while the Chinese currency has seen a near 2% depreciation. Textiles, electronics goods and pharma are among sectors, where govt is assessing the capacity that manufacturers in India have.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116026088,imgsize-801827,width-400,resizemode-4/116026088.jpg"

NEW DELHI: While backing government’s Make in India initiative , Russian president Vladimir Putin has said that Russian companies will look to invest in the country and urged BRICS members to come on a common platform.While drawing parallels with Russia’s import substitution plan, at the VTB Russia Calling Investment Forum, Putin said: “PM Modi has a similar programme called Make in India. We are also ready to set up our manufacturing operations in India. The Indian govt, under the PM’s leadership, has been creating stable conditions, driven by a policy of putting India first. We believe that investing in India is profitable.”Putin’s comments and his reference to Rosneft’s investment of $20 billion in the country, may be apointer to discussions that Russian companies have had with Indian counterparts and authorities, regarding pumping in money into certain sectors, which can export goods to Russia and other parts of the world. In fact, food, pharma and certain other sectors had been identified as potential investment bets with money generated from sale of crude to India being used for the purpose. The statement comes ahead of his proposed visit to India next year.The Russian president used the forum to promote his own govt’s initiative arguing that new Russian brands are replacing Western brands that exited the market after the US and European countries imposed sanctions in the wake of the conflict in Ukraine.In a statement, the Indian govt said Putin sought greater cooperation among BRICS nations to support growth of SMEs and suggested that member countries identify key areas for collaboration. “Referring to the investment platform Russia is developing with BRICS, President Putin said it has the potential to benefit all partner countries and is expected to become an important instrument for supporting our economies and providing financial resources to the countries of the Global South and East,” he was quoted as saying.",Vladimir Putin has said that Russian companies will look to invest in the country.

But it is also a fact that if you become excessively dependent on a single supply chain or in the name of supply chain, you open up your market that it is no longer a supply chain, but your sectors are getting hollowed out. You have to be careful,"" he said.""Nobody is saying don't do business (with China). But we are equally saying, think about it, weigh it, and look at the bigger-term implications, especially for micro, small & medium enterprises (MSMEs),"" he added.He said that India aims to avoid becoming merely a market for another economy, unable to compete with products being dumped into the country.Jaishankar further said that while there has been ""some progress"" in resolving remaining friction points along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh, further discussions are necessary.""We have managed to make some progress out there. We have to now sit down and discuss with the Chinese what we do further. You know, there are no black and white answers in very sharp terms. I think everything needs to be balanced,"" he said.Meanwhile, the EAM expressed concern regarding the Red Sea shipping disruptions amidst the West Asian situation. He said that alternative shipping routes are increasing transportation costs, affecting trade significantly. However, he mentioned that Indian Navy has been assisting the situation.""I think it is a big concern for us. We have tried to do our share. We actually deployed some Navy ships as well. It is of very direct economic consequence. So we have actually been interacting with all the major players including Iran and Israel,"" Jaishankar said.""We want restraint. We want a cooling down. We want a ceasefire and we want negotiations so that actually our economic interests are not threatened,"" he added.Additionally, while addressing India-Russia trade relations, Jaishankar mentioned conveying to Moscow the need for greater access for Indian exports to the Russian market.""We are pressing them in the pharma industry, marine products, and some agro-products. There are SPS (sanitary and phytosanitary) restrictions, non-tariff barriers, and standards (that) make you do things even if you have certification somewhere else. These are standard tactics which everybody employs to keep the other guy out. Now we have to find ways of going through it and persuading them, cajoling them.

Israeli response and ongoing negotiations

Devastating toll of war

President-elect Donald Trump issued a stern warning to Hamas on Monday, demanding the immediate release of hostages held in Gaza.Writing on his Truth Social platform, Trump stated that if the hostages were not freed before his inauguration on January 20, 2025, there would be ""all hell to pay"" in the Middle East.“Everybody is talking about the hostages who are being held so violently, inhumanely, and against the will of the entire World, in the Middle East - But it’s all talk, and no action! Please let this Truth serve to represent that if the hostages are not released prior to January 20, 2025, the date that I proudly assume Office as President of the United States, there will be all hell to pay in the Middle East, and for those in charge who perpetrated these atrocities against Humanity”, he wrote.""Those responsible will be hit harder than anybody has been hit in the long and storied history of the United States of America. Release the hostages now!,"" he added, calling for the immediate release of those still in captivity.This marks Trump’s most direct comments on the issue since his election in November.According to Israeli officials, over 250 hostages were taken during Hamas-led attacks on October 7, 2023. Of these, approximately 100 remain in captivity, with some confirmed dead, reported the news agency Reuters.The assault, which left 1,200 dead, is considered the deadliest in Israel's history.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu or his office has not commented on Trump’s statement as of now. However, President Isaac Herzog expressed gratitude, posting on X, ""Thank you and bless you, Mr. President-elect @realDonaldTrump. We all pray for the moment we see our sisters and brothers back home!""Hamas has reportedly linked any release of hostages to an end to Israel’s military operations in Gaza and a complete withdrawal from the territory.The Biden administration has engaged in extensive diplomacy, brokering a fragile ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon, but Hamas has shown little willingness to negotiate for a broader peace deal, according to US officials cited by news agency AP.The conflict, which began with Hamas’ surprise attack, has devastated Gaza.As per Reuters, Israeli airstrikes have killed over 44,400 Palestinians, with nearly 90 per cent of Gaza’s 2.3 million residents displaced, as per the territory’s health ministry. The war has also levelled significant portions of the enclave.Trump’s threats came just hours after Israel confirmed the death of Omer Neutra, a dual US-Israeli citizen, whose remains are believed to still be in Gaza.Meanwhile, Hamas released a video of Edan Alexander, an Israeli soldier held hostage, urging Trump to secure the freedom of those captured.Trump’s allies hope for a hostage release deal before his return to office, but the situation remains tense, with both Israel and Hamas showing no signs of compromise.","US President-elect Donald Trump issued a stern warning to Hamas on Monday, demanding the immediate release of hostages held in Gaza.

President-elect Donald Trump’s pick of a crypto proponent to be the next head of the US securities regulator lifted Bitcoin to $100,000 for the first time as traders warmed to the prospect of relaxed regulations.The digital asset rose as much as 6.1% to $103,801 on Thursday before changing hands at $101,968 as of 6:45 am in London. The crypto market overall has jumped by roughly $1.3 trillion since Trump’s election victory on Nov 5 on a platform that includes a tight embrace of the crypto sector.Trump selected Paul Atkins to replace outgoing Securities & Exchange Commission chair Gary Gensler, who cracked down on digital assets after a 2022 market rout exposed fraudulent practices and sparked costly blowups.“This is a momentum rally,” said Jason Titman, CEO, crypto brokerage Swyftx. “Global spot volumes are above mid-pandemic levels and nomination of Paul Atkins as SEC chair just added to the carnival atmosphere.”On November 22, Bitcoin was less than $300 from achie ving $100,000 but fell back while remaining in sight of the landmark level. Crypto’s adherents view the six-figure number as a validation of controversial claims that Bitcoin is a modern-day store of value and a hedge for inflation risk. For critics, the digital asset lacks any fundamental value and is too exposed to speculative whims.Hitting $100,000 is “a huge milestone for token and crypto industry as a whole,” said Caroline Mauron, co-founder of Orbit Markets, a provider of liquidity for crypto derivatives. “We expect further momentum for the coming days.”US exchange-traded funds for Bitcoin have attrac ted a net inflow of about $32 billion this year, including over $8 billion since Trump became president-elect, data compiled by Bloomberg sho wed. The combined trading volume for digital assets and related derivatives across centralised exchanges climbed to a record of more than $10 trillion last month, according to CCData.Trump has vowed to undo a Biden administration clampdown on digital assets, install friendly regulators and turn the US into global home of crypto. The Republican even backed idea of strategic national Bitcoin reserve, though there are doubts over whether the latter objective is feasible.","The digital asset rose as much as 6.1% to $103,801 on Thursday before changing hands at $101,968 as of 6:45 am in London.

Another BTC rally is coming, and the meme coin market is already stealing headlines. The latest meme coin in the spotlight is Catslap .The project’s quirky narrative is centred around a feisty feline that slaps anything that gets in its way. The token exploded 1800% on its Uniswap launch , but its market cap is still incredibly low.Could SLAP be the next meme coin to explode? Catslap ($SLAP) introduces a slap-to-earn model that allows investors to earn crypto rewards by slapping their favourite memes. The more they slap, the more they earn, and the more the project burns.As the Slapometer count increases, so does the number of tokens burnt. The reward model has country and user leaderboards.Catslap was launched directly on Uniswap without any presales. The fair launch lays a level playing field for new investors.Aggressive marketing campaigns will go live over the coming weeks to strengthen the community. For those seeking a high-risk, high-reward opportunity, Catslap is a meme coin to watch out now. The $SLAP community has exploded to around 10,000 members onWith the dog coin niche saturated, investors have turned their attention to cat coins. According to CoinMarketCap, cat coins have a total market cap of under $5 billion now. That is incredibly low when compared to dog coins, which boast a market cap of close to $90 billion.The difference underscores the growth potential of the cat coin niche. It is taking off as Popcat (SOL) and Mog Coin (MOG) top the hot lists. For example, Popcat has exploded close to 8000% in a year, while MOG recorded 9000% gains.The problem, however, is that these cat coins are close to hitting their saturation points. MOG is closing in on a $1 billion market cap, and Popcat has already smashed it.Even if they dominate the niche, they don’t have much room left for growth. Not for multifold, explosive price surges.This is where new projects like Catslap enter the picture. Due to their low initial market caps, they are capable of turbocharged surges.For a better context, Catslap’s market cap is just around $10 million now. If it jumps over $100 million, it could yield close to 1000% returns for early investors. For Popcat to deliver similar gains, it would need to cross a staggering $10 billion market cap. Even large meme coins like Pepe hover under the $10 billion point.Catslap just burnt 25 million tokens as part of strengthening its price momentum. Token burns are commonly used in the crypto space to drive a token’s value. They cut down the permanent supply, which, in turn, could positively affect the price.SLAP is an Ethereum-based meme coin. The SLAP tokenomics solidifies the project’s commitment to long-term growth and sustainability.The $SLAP tokenomics focuses on stable and community-driven growth. It gives Catslap an edge over its cat coin competitors.Crypto influencer Austin Hilton, who commands a YouTube community of over 280,000 members, recently featured the project on his channel. He drew attention to the project’s growth potential as a new contender in the cat coin space.The meme coin community is ready to embrace another bull season. Catslap is positioned to pounce on the opportunity. It is too early to tell whether it can replicate the success of Popcat and Mogcoin.Catslap is available for purchase on decentralised exchanges like Uniswap. Investors can also purchase the token directly through Best Wallet, the popular non-custodial wallet. Both crypto and fiat payments are accepted.The token has undergone a security audit by Solidproof to mitigate risks of hacks and theft. $SLAP is live on both Dex Screener and DexTools.*You must be at least 18 years old to access this site.","Catslap ($SLAP) introduces a slap-to-earn model that allows investors to earn crypto rewards by slapping their favourite memes.

"Afghan economy shows modest signs of growth but recovery remains fragile, says World Bank",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/afghan-economy-shows-modest-signs-of-growth-but-recovery-remains-fragile-says-world-bank/articleshow/115998852.cms,"Image credit: AP

Afghanistan's economy is showing modest signs of growth after two years of severe contraction, the World Bank said.In its latest development update issued late Wednesday, the financial institution said modest GDP growth of 2.7% was driven by private consumption. The partial recovery, coupled with falling food prices, helped to gradually improve household welfare.Before the Taliban returned to power in August 2021, Afghanistan's economy relied heavily on foreign aid and corruption was rife. Their takeover three years ago sent the economy into a tailspin, as billions in international funds were frozen, and tens of thousands of highly skilled Afghans fled the country and took their money with them.Afghan's exports remained stable in 2023-24 but imports surged, creating a widening trade deficit, according to the World Bank. This deficit, exacerbated by dependence on imports for essential goods like fuel, food and machinery, could pose a risk to the country's economic stability.Faris Hadad-Zervos, the World Bank's country director for Afghanistan, said long-term growth prospects required tapping into the substantial potential of the domestic private sector and improving the overall business environment.""Key to this is increased investment, providing access to finance to small businesses, and supporting educated and skilled women entrepreneurs so their businesses can thrive,"" said Hadad-Zervos. ""Without this, the country risks prolonged stagnation with limited prospects for sustainable development.""The update comes days after media reports that the Taliban have ordered educational institutions to stop providing medical training to women and girls. The Taliban have neither confirmed the order nor responded to the reports.On Thursday, the head of the UN children's agency Unicef said she was deeply alarmed by the reported restrictions.Unicef was determining the veracity of these differing accounts and welcomed efforts to address the issue, said the agency's executive director Catherine Russell.If confirmed, this ban was expected to immediately halt the medical education of thousands of women and jeopardize women and girls' access to health care, she added.""It would not only further limit the ability of women to contribute to society and earn an income but would also have far-reaching consequences for the health of the Afghan population. Lives would be lost,"" she warned.","Afghanistan's economy is showing modest signs of growth after two years of contraction.

However, China's share in Pakistan's total external debt went down to 22 per cent compared to 25 per cent in 2023 with Saudi Arabia increasing its share from 2 per cent in 2023 to 7 per cent in 2024.The World Bank's International Debt Report 2024 released on Tuesday ranks Pakistan among the top three loan recipients from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) this year and also notes that Pakistan's high debt-to-export and debt-to-revenue ratios indicate a weakening fiscal position.The International Debt Report 2024 put Pakistan's total external debt (including that from IMF) at $ 130.85 billion in 2023, accounting for 352 per cent of its total exports and 39 per cent of gross national income (GNI) while Pakistan's total external debt servicing amounted to 43 per cent of total exports and 5 per cent of GNI.As per the 2023 edition of the report, Pakistan's total external debt (including that from IMF) was at $ 126.95 billion in 2023, accounting for 320 per cent of its total exports and 34 per cent of gross national income (GNI) while Pakistan's total external debt servicing amounted to 42 per cent of total exports and 4 per cent of GNI.According to the 2024 report, China had the single largest share of debt to Pakistan at 22 per cent share (about $ 28.786 billion), followed by World Bank's 18 per cent share ($ 23.55 billion) and Asian Development Bank's 15 per cent share ($ 19.63 billion).Saudi Arabia stood out as the second largest bilateral lender to Pakistan with 7 per cent of total debt or about $ 9.16 billion.Of the total external debt stock, about 45 per cent debt ($ 58.88 billion) belonged to the bilateral lenders and 46 per cent (about $ 60.2 billion) to multilaterals, while remaining 9 per cent debt belonged to private lenders led by bondholders with 8 per cent chunk, the 2024 report said.It further noted that of the total $ 130.85 bn, long-term external debt stocks stood at $ 110.44 billion; $ 11.53 billion was IMF credit and allocations and $ 8.878 billion was short-term external debt.According to newspaper Dawn, the financial strain was fiercest for the poorest and most vulnerable countries - those eligible to borrow from the World Bank's International Development Association (IDA). These countries paid a record $ 96.2 billion to service their debt in 2023, the data showed.For some countries, the payments run as high as 38 per cent of export earnings but Pakistan even surpassed this landmark as its interest payments stood at 43 per cent of exports, it said, adding, Pakistan made the second-largest interest payments in South Asia while the interest payment by Bangladesh and India increased by more than 90 per cent in 2023, highest in the region.In September, Minister of State for Finance Ali Pervaiz Malik told a meeting of the National Assembly Standing Committee that Pakistan was facing a daunting task of repaying a staggering $ 100 billion external debt over the next four years, an amount which is nearly 10 times its current $ 9.4 billion foreign exchange reserves.The $ 100 billion external debt repayments from 2024 to 2027 are exclusive of any payments on account of the liabilities booked at the balance sheet of the central bank and the requirements for financing the current account deficitMeanwhile, the Pakistan government on Monday admitted that there are ""hiccups"" in implementing the IMF programme, but asserted its commitment to completing the $ 7 billion package.",World Bank's International Debt Report 2024 ranks Pakistan among the top three loan recipients from the International Monetary Fund.

As crypto is firmly in bull market territory, now is the time to stack up on altcoins. A new project, Cutoshi, currently in presale, is gaining a lot of traction.Bitcoin has essentially been adopted by mainstream finance, meaning that it will not go to 0, despite the 477 ‘Bitcoin obituaries’ in the past. Many ‘experts’ are now publishing articles about why they were wrong about BTC.As long as the bull market continues, BTC should keep going up, but it will be outperformed by many smaller-cap coins.Considering that Ethereum, like Bitcoin, has had a Spot ETF, the price action this year has been disappointing. As Bitcoin makes all-time highs, ETH is struggling to get close to its ATH of $4,878, and is currently trading at around $3,451.According to DeFiLlama, over 63% of all decentralized finance and money locked (TVL) is stored on Ethereum. Many Layer 2 blockchains are built upon it that use ETH as a gas token, such as Arbitrum.With the new pro-crypto administration coming in, it looks as though the issue of ETH being a potential security is over. Another benefit is that ETH staking rewards can potentially be integrated into the ETF returns, making Ethereum Spot ETFs more attractive for institutional investors.Known as the Ethereum killer, Solana is considered to be Etheruem’s rival. It’s built with a different coding language and offers fast speeds and low fees. Solana became the chain of choice for many meme coins since the launch of the easy-to-use meme coin deployer Pump.fun.Solana is likely to be the next coin to receive a Spot ETF, with applications from asset managers Bitwise, VanEck, 21Shares and Canary Capital.If Solana can grow as big as ETH is now, then that's room for 3.74x growth, as we can see from the picture below:Image from MarketCapOf If Solana grows as big as ETH did in the last bull run, that's a SOL price of $1,205.26 (5.15x).While the previous coins are the three biggest in all crypto, in terms of market cap and overall adoption, every portfolio, especially a crypto one, needs a small-cap coin with a lot of potential.Cutoshi is a cat-based meme coin with a devoted community. Cutoshi is also a DeFi ecosystem in the making, giving it long-term use cases and functionality. Currently building a P2P and cross-chain DEX to make DeFi more simple, teaching people how to use DeFi through a fun learning space and offering people the ability to do yield farming and more.Cutoshi is in the third stage of its presale, soon to move to stage four, with over $1.1 million raised already.To put the opportunity in context, let's compare it to one of the most successful memecoins that also does DeFi - Shiba Inu.Image from MarketCapOf As we can see, if CUTO can reach the size of SHIB, that’s an amazing 1271.35x. CUTO, which is currently on sale for $0.0259, could be worth close to $33 dollars in the long term.For more information on the Cutoshi (CUTO) Presale:Email: alex@cutoshi.com Join and become a community member:","As crypto is firmly in bull market territory, now is the time to stack up on altcoins.

After the U.S. Election Day on November 5, Ripple's XRP has been causing waves in the crypto market with an amazing price rise. At $1.89 right now, XRP has tripled from its pre-election value. Today's major question– how high can XRP go before Trump's inauguration in January? The market is responding favorably to the political and legal changes linked to his presidency.The cryptocurrency market depends on sentiment, speculation, and legislative changes– all of which have driven XRP's recent price surge. Since November 5, the coin has profited from growing investor confidence, most likely inspired by Donald Trump's triumph and the expected legislative change supporting digital assets. XRP has tripled its value in less than a month, providing strong upward momentum. The announced departure of Gary Gensler, the SEC Chair, set for Trump's inauguration day, is a major component driving this surge. Particularly for currencies like XRP that have been under regulatory scrutiny in the past, Gensler's leaving is a positive development for the cryptocurrency scene. Gensler's resignation has market players looking forward to a softer regulatory environment under the next government.Market experts are positive regarding XRP's future for even more expansion before Trump's inauguration. Some forecasts indicate XRP might surpass the $5 level, particularly if the present positive attitude continues. Strong technical indications, past trends, and rising trade volumes are our estimate's foundation. More speculative predictions, though, have XRP rising to $15 following the inauguration. Although these forecasts are interesting, they are somewhat speculative and depend on several elements, including regulation changes, more general market trends, and Ripple's capacity to find new alliances or increase its usage. Rexas Finance (RXS) is another coin quietly taking the front stage as XRP rides the wave of optimistic feelings. With its real-world asset tokenizing features, RXS is emerging as a revolutionary force in the crypto sector. It is primed to soar even bigger than XRP before Trump's inauguration.With just one click, Rexas Finance lets consumers purchase, sell, and fractionalize real-world assets, including real estate, artwork, and intellectual property. This special use case makes RXS a game-changer since it provides countless options for investors looking for exposure to real assets in the digital environment. As of writing, Rexas Finance (RXS) is priced at $0.10 and has already raised an outstanding $19.95 million. It is currently in its eighth presale round. The coin's presale has shown amazing enthusiasm; its price has tripled from the first stage. This path reflects the recent performance of XRP, but with a major difference: RXS is still in its presale phase, so it has great growth capacity.With a stunning 19,900% return from its present price, top market analysts estimate RXS might surge to $20 before Trump takes office. With this expansion far higher than XRP's possible returns, RXS appeals to investors trying to profit from the continuous crypto surge. Rexas Finance represents a revolution and is not only a symbol. With unparalleled access and flexibility, the platform lets consumers tokenize almost any real-world asset. From anywhere globally, RXS lets everyone engage in the tokenized economy, whether their participation is full ownership or fractional investment.Although the recent price surge of XRP has made news, Rexas Finance (RXS) presents a convincing substitute with better profits. Although XRP gains from market mood and regulatory confidence, its rise is mostly related to macroeconomic events and Ripple's continuous legal conflicts. By merging blockchain technology with actual asset tokenization, RXS offers a fresh horizon in cryptocurrencies. Its ambitious roadmap and presale success suggest that it may outpace XRP in terms of acceptance and expansion. With forecasts of a 19,900% increase before Trump's inauguration, RXS offers early investors potentially life-changing rewards.In conclusion, XRP and Rexas Finance (RXS) are among the best candidates as the crypto market moves into a new phase of hope and possibilities. XRP’s price surge reflects renewed investor confidence and regulatory optimism, while RXS offers a groundbreaking use case with unparalleled growth potential. XRP provides a relatively stable option with strong market momentum, while RXS offers the chance to get in on the ground floor of a revolutionary project poised for exponential growth.For more information about Rexas Finance (RXS) visit the links below:Website: https://rexas.com Win $1 Million Giveaway: https://bit.ly/Rexas1M Whitepaper: https://rexas.com/rexas-whitepaper.pdf Twitter/X: https://x.com/rexasfinance","Ripple's XRP has been causing waves in the crypto market with an amazing price rise.

These airlines saw the most delays and complaints in 2024,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/these-airlines-saw-the-most-delays-and-complaints-in-2024/articleshow/115954750.cms,"Curious to know the airlines that topped or tanked on AirHelp’s 2024 global rankings? Here’s a quick list.

Worst airlines in the world

Best airlines in the world

The Sunday after Thanksgiving weekend marked a fresh record for US air travel with the Transportation Security Administration screening more than 3 million passengers in a single day. That doesn’t mean everything went smoothly, of course.AirHelp Inc., which facilitates compensation for passengers by processing customer service claims for flight disruptions and lost luggage, has released its annual analysis of the best and worst performing airlines. The 2024 AirHelp Score report , published on Tuesday, comes just in time for the holiday season.The airline rankings methodology takes into account customer claims processed worldwide, as well as outside data tracking on-time arrival and departure performance for every plane, plus feedback from passengers from over 54 countries on the quality of food, comfort and crew service on their most recent flight. The aim is to give a snapshot of airline performance, says AirHelp Chief Executive Officer Tomasz Pawliszyn, with hope that the analysis “encourages airlines to continuously listen to passenger feedback.” Data analyzed for this round spanned from January through October.The worst performing airline in the world? That’s Tunisair, coming in last at No. 109. Keeping it company in the bottom 10 are a handful of national and low-cost carriers, including Buzz, a Polish airline that is a subsidiary of Ryanair Holdings PLC, Bulgaria Air, Turkish carrier Pegasus Airlines and Air Mauritius. But ranking in the bottom 50, too, are North American carriers JetBlue and Air Canada.Sort the results based solely on customer opinion and Tunisair keeps the title of the worst performing, followed closely by Ryanair and Aer Lingus, a subsidiary of IAG SA, which also owns British Airways and Iberia.As for the best all-around airline globally: It’s Brussels Airlines, part of Deutsche Lufthansa AG, bumping Qatar Airways to No. 2 after holding the top spot since 2018. That’s a marked improvement for the Belgian national airline that was rated No. 12 last year.Both United Airlines and American Airlines ranked in the top five, in third and fourth place respectively, which might come as a surprise to US travelers given the flight disruptions which plagued domestic airlines this past year. Both have consistently ranked in AirHelp’s top 10 since at least 2022.“We also had a new North American nominee come through this year, Air Transat, the Canadian airline was ranked in position 36,” notes Pawliszyn. Delta Air Lines dropped to No. 17 from No. 11 in 2023, which Pawliszyn explains is due to a reduction in its claim processing score, while its on-time performance and customer opinion rankings haven’t shifted much. The airline’s July tech outage led to more than 3,000 complaints being filed about Delta with the Department of Transportation.Alaska Airlines, due to merge with Hawaiian Holdings Inc., also dropped more than 30 spots to No. 88 this year.100.

BERLIN: Almost 100,000 workers joined walkouts at Volkswagen 's German plants on Monday in protest at management plans to cut wages and even close sites at Europe's biggest carmaker, the IG Metall union said, threatening further industrial action.With two-hour strikes by workers on morning shifts and early walkouts on evening shifts, a total of 98,650 employees at nine plants across Germany took part in the industrial action, said the union on Tuesday.Volkswagen has threatened to close plants in Germany for the first time in its 87-year history to reduce costs and boost profit.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume.While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Stock market recommendations:Trent surpassed the milestone of 1,000 fashion stores for FY25, reaching a total of 757 Zudio stores—an increase of 39%—and 248 Westside stores, marking 6% growth. In the March 2025 quarter alone, 122 new Zudio stores were added. Trent’s industry-leading growth, driven by healthy SSSG, store productivity, and robust footprint additions, along with the scale-up of Zudio and newer categories, offers a huge runway for growth over the next few years. TRENT’s focus on ramping up Star through Fresh and its own brands provides an additional growth driver in the grocery segment. We estimate a revenue/EBITDA/PAT CAGR of 32%/34%/39% over FY24-27, driven by 21% CAGR in area additions & mid-single-digit improvement in productivity.HDFC Bank is effectively addressing post-merger challenges (high CD ratio, costly borrowings) through robust deposit mobilization (+15% CAGR FY25-27E) and portfolio rebalancing toward high-yielding Retail/Commercial & Rural Banking loans (~11% CAGR). NIMs (3.43% in 3QFY25) are poised to expand to 3.5-3.6% by FY27 as funding costs ease, supported by a rising CASA mix. Prudent asset quality (GNPA/NNPA: 1.4%/0.4%) and a hefty INR262b provision buffer mitigate risks. Operational streamlining (cost-to-income: ~40% by FY27) and margin recovery underpin RoA/RoE targets of 1.8%/14.1%.","According to Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd, the top stock picks for the week (starting April 7, 2025) are Trent and HDFC Bank.

"Delhivery to acquire Ecom Express for Rs 1,407 crore in all cash deal",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/delhivery-to-acquire-ecom-express-for-rs-1407-crore-in-all-cash-deal/articleshow/120013013.cms,"In a big move for the logistics industry, Delhivery has announced its acquisition of Ecom Express in an all-cash deal valued at Rs 1,407 crore.This deal, which marks the largest consolidation in the sector, comes at a time when Ecom Express has been grappling with financial difficulties and has recently cancelled its plans to go public.According to an ET Tech report, once considered a strong competitor to Delhivery, Ecom Express was last valued at over Rs 7,000 crore in June 2024 but has struggled with operational challenges in recent months.Through this acquisition, private equity firms Warburg Pincus, Partners Group, and British International Investment will completely exit their investments in Ecom Express. For Delhivery, the deal represents a strategic move to increase its scale and strengthen its competitive position in the fast-evolving logistics market.Sahil Barua, Managing Director and CEO of Delhivery, expressed confidence in the move, stating, “The Indian economy needs continuous improvements in logistics cost efficiency, speed, and reach. This acquisition will help us serve the customers of both companies better by making bold investments in infrastructure, technology, and our network.”Delhivery, with Rs 5,488 crore in cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024, is well-positioned to finance the acquisition. The deal is still subject to approval from the Competition Commission of India (CCI) but is expected to close in the next six months. After the acquisition, Ecom Express will operate as a subsidiary of Delhivery.The deal marks the end of Ecom Express's IPO ambitions. The company had previously filed a draft prospectus in August 2024, seeking to raise Rs 1,284.5 crore in fresh capital while also offering Rs 1,315.5 crore in secondary stake sales. However, the deteriorating market conditions led to the postponement of these plans.In the lead-up to the acquisition, Ecom Express had already begun consolidating its operations, shutting down several delivery hubs, and laying off hundreds of employees. Delhivery had also raised concerns about Ecom Express's financial practices, accusing its rival of inflating its operational metrics, particularly by double-counting return-to-origin shipments, which inflated the company’s reported volumes.Ecom Express has faced further challenges following the death of its cofounder, T. A. Krishnan, in October 2023. Krishnan, who helped establish the company in 2012 and played a vital role in shaping India’s e-commerce logistics landscape, had stepped back from day-to-day operations over a year before his passing.","Delhivery has announced its acquisition of Ecom Express in an all-cash deal valued at Rs 1,407 crore.

"Trump's tariffs: Apple, Samsung to up dispatch of India-made stuff",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/trumps-tariffs-apple-samsung-to-up-dispatch-of-india-made-stuff/articleshow/120045331.cms,"NEW DELHI: 'Make in India' is the mantra as global smartphone giants Apple and Samsung look to re-calibrate worldwide production to blunt the impact of Donald Trump's higher tariffs on China and Vietnam, when shipping to the US.Even though it is a logistical challenge with major customs and other regulatory efforts required, the issue is being addressed on an urgent basis to ensure that supplies to the US remain competitive.Also read: Flurry of exports as firms raced to beat Trump tariffs Apple, the world's biggest electronics seller, has started to use production at India's factories to ship iPhones to the US, with plans to drastically cut down exports from China. The decision is being taken as Trump has announced a 26% reciprocal tariff on Indian exports to the US, while it is 54% for China, including the 34% announced last week, and 46% for Vietnam.""India's factories will be increasingly used to ship only to the US. Demand in other markets such as Europe, Latin America and even Asia will now be catered to from the China factories. In a way, this will be a significant leapfrogging for iPhone production in India and may lead to major expansion in the country, if Apple decides to stick to the formula going forward,"" a top industry official told TOI.Also read: Stocked-up Apple buys time, may not pass on duties soon Currently, iPhones in India are being made by units of Taiwanese Foxconn and Tata group. The latter had acquired the assets of Wistron and Pegatron - both from Taiwan - over the past few years. ""If Apple does not go for developing all-new production zones in locations, such as the UAE and Saudi Arabia, or in Brazil - all of which have US tariffs of 10% - then there will be a significant expansion of capacity in India,"" the official said.Any such move will see major investments by both Foxconn and Tatas, which could see iPhone shipments to the US grow massively from the estimated $10 billion this fiscal. A lot will, however, depend on discussions between the US with other countries.In case of Samsung, the matter is equally serious as its manufacturing set-up in Vietnam has exports of around $55 billion. ""Samsung will find it better to ship from India at a duty of 26% than export from Vietnam. While this will be a temporary measure till the Vietnamese govt negotiates with the US, it adds a lot of importance to Make in India,"" the official added. Vietnam has proposed zero duty for US exports. Samsung's factory in Noida makes smartphones, including S25 and Fold.Sources said those negotiating Bilateral Trade Agreement (BTA) with the US are ""aware of these dynamics"" and plan to use them to extract maximum for India's global manufacturing goals.","'Make in India' is the mantra as global smartphone giants Apple and Samsung look to re-calibrate worldwide production.

RBI likely to cut rates by 25bps: Economists,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/rbi-likely-to-cut-rates-by-25bps-economists/articleshow/120048316.cms,"MUMBAI: Economists expect RBI to cut interest rates by 25 basis points (100bps = 1 percentage point) at the conclusion of its three-day monetary policy meeting on April 9, despite global trade uncertainties triggered by US President Donald Trump's tariffs. Inflation falling below RBI's projections, along with signs of easing growth, has created room for further monetary easing.Several economists also feel that RBI could signal a shift in policy stance. ""Since the last meeting, inflation has come under control, which gives RBI more room to adopt for 'less restrictive' monetary policy and also support growth,"" said Sonal Badhan, economist at Bank of Baroda.She expects a 25bps rate cut and a change in stance to ""accommodative,"" with a cumulative 75bps reduction likely in this cycle. Another source of comfort to the rate setting panel is the sharp drop in crude oil prices globally coupled with a decline in the dollar index with some like Barclays seeing the possibility of a 35bps cut.Radhika Rao of DBS Bank also expects the repo rate to be cut by 25bps to 6%. ""Domestic data has aligned to make way for the monetary policy committee to lower rates further, characterised by easing inflation and growth while depreciation pressure on the rupee has eased significantly,"" she said.Rao added that trimmed inflation indicators remained benign, and more than two-thirds of CPI sub-components rose by less than 4% year-on-year in early 2025. She cautioned, however, that external risks persist. ""The MPC is likely to be guarded on the uncertain global backdrop as trade distortions pose stagflationary risks to the US and raise the risk of slower global trade,"" Rao said.Barclays' India chief economist Aastha Gudwani projects a 25bps cut as the base case but flagged the possibility of a 35bps easing to reflect the extent of undershooting on CPI inflation. ""At 3.6% year-on-year, CPI inflation for Feb came in even lower than our below-consensus estimate,"" she said. Gudwani also expects a neutral stance to be retained, arguing that while ""a non-standard cut could suggest panic on growth, we advise against this perception"". Barclays sees inflation easing to 4% in FY26 and expects the terminal policy rate at 5.5% by Dec 2025.","Economists expect RBI to cut interest rates by 25 basis points (100bps = 1 percentage point) at the conclusion of its three-day monetary policy meeting on April 9.

Govt unlikely to ease checks on investments from China,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/govt-unlikely-to-ease-checks-on-investments-from-china/articleshow/120044427.cms,"NEW DELHI: Govt is unlikely to ease investment checks on Chinese companies amid growing calls to review FDI norms as it remains wary of flows from across the border. US President Donald Trump's tariffs have made it even more alert to the growing threat of Chinese companies and their exports, some of which may be diverted to India and other Asian markets.Private sector has been pushing the Modi govt to review its investment regime, which was tightened after Covid outbreak in 2020 and the Chinese hostility in Ladakh resulted in a ban on several apps and visa and govt procurement curbs. The clamour for easing the FDI norms has only gone up in the last few days with many experts and commentators arguing that an alliance with countries such as China, especially for technology, will help India navigate the crisis better.Govt's concerns are manifold including the opaque nature of ownership of Chinese companies and their close ties with the communist regime and the military. Besides, China's non-market economy status based on its policies, be it subsidies to manufacturers or loan write-offs, which some in govt view as indirect doles, add to the concern over easing of curbs.In any case, the regime is seen to be hostile towards India's bid to gain more manufacturing muscle. While govt has been seeking to attract global giants to set up factories in India, Chinese authorities have often sought to tighten the screws on these companies, whether it is Apple's top phone makers or small vendors that supply components to the iPhone maker, or other players.The investment checks through Press Note 3 - that mandates case by case approval for all investment from countries that share a land border with India - also provides govt flexibility in allowing who it wants to allow. In the past, the tool has been used to block EV-maker BYD's bid to invest $1 billion through a joint venture with Megha Engineering, which later got entangled in the electoral bonds controversy.Govt sources suspect that some of the noise was being generated by Chinese companies whose bid to expand has been stalled in the absence of govt approvals, prompting them to dilute their equity in favour of Indian entities.",Private sector has been pushing the Modi govt to review its investment regime.

To date, lenders have recovered Rs 45,000 crore of the Rs 99,000 crore owed, while the recovery target has been increased to Rs 61,000 crore.The Appellate Tribunal had originally set March 31, 2025, as the deadline for the completion of the resolution process for 58 entities.

Saudi stock market faces worst loss in 5 years amid US tariffs: State media,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/saudi-stock-market-faces-worst-loss-in-5-years-amid-us-tariffs-state-media/articleshow/120041428.cms,"Representative image

The Saudi stock market experienced its largest daily drop in five years, with the index falling by 6.78% on Sunday. This marked the worst loss since the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic, according to state media.According to news agency AFP, the sharp decline was triggered by the recent imposition of sweeping trade tariffs by the US, which led to a global stock market rout and heightened fears of a full-scale trade war and potential recession.Al-Ekhbariya, the state-run television channel, reported that the Saudi stock index closed nearly 7% lower, losing over 800 points. The news outlet described the drop as ""the largest daily loss in five years "" and pointed out that many Saudi companies, including the oil giant Aramco, were hit hard by the downturn.The tariffs, introduced by President Donald Trump, have had a significant impact on global markets, with Saudi stocks bearing the brunt of the fallout. The utilities sector saw a 8.4% drop, while banking, telecommunications, and energy sectors fell by 6.9%, 5.9%, and 5.29%, respectively.Shares in Saudi Aramco, a key pillar of the kingdom's economy, plummeted by 6.2%. According to the state-run financial newspaper Al-Eqtisadiah, the Saudi stock market lost more than half a trillion riyals (approximately $133 billion) in value during Sunday’s trading session.A substantial portion of the losses was attributed to the drop in Aramco’s market value, which fell by more than 340 billion riyals.Other Gulf stock markets also mirrored the global trend, suffering significant losses as countries across the world grappled with the effects of Trump’s tariffs. This turmoil has sparked a panic that has lasted for several days, and analysts predict further declines when markets reopen on Monday.","The Saudi stock market experienced its largest daily drop in five years, with the index falling by 6.78% on Sunday.

Global markets crash as Donald Trump tariff blitz sparks panic and retaliation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/global-markets-crash-as-donald-trump-tariff-blitz-sparks-panic-and-retaliation/articleshow/120049689.cms,"Representative AI image generated by Denny

NEW DELHI: Asian stock markets nosedived on Monday as global financial turmoil deepened, triggered by US President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs and China’s retaliatory measures. With fears of a full-blown trade war mounting, US futures pointed to further losses on Wall Street, compounding Friday’s historic meltdown.Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 fell 7.1% in early trade after briefly plunging nearly 8%, while Taiwan’s benchmark index slumped close to 10%. South Korea’s Kospi lost 5.5%, Australia’s ASX 200 dropped 6.3%, and Singapore tumbled 8.5%, signalling widespread panic across Asia. The ASX 200 also hit its lowest level in almost 15 months.The sharp sell-off followed Wall Street’s worst single-day performance since the Covid-19 pandemic. On Friday, the S&P 500 fell 6%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 5.5%, and the Nasdaq slid 5.8%, erasing trillions in market value.Analysts estimate that over $9 trillion has been wiped off global stock markets in just two days, drawing comparisons to the 2008 financial crisis. Investor confidence has evaporated following China’s decision to impose a 34% tariff on all US imports beginning April 10, intensifying fears of prolonged economic disruption .Meanwhile, US crude dipped below $60 per barrel for the first time since April 2021, and the dollar weakened to 145.98 yen, indicating a rush towards traditional safe-haven assets.Despite the mounting turmoil, Donald Trump remained unapologetic and said, “Sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something,” denying he was deliberately fuelling a market collapse. Speaking aboard Air Force One, he insisted countries were eager to negotiate: “They’re dying to make a deal.”The latest wave of chaos was set off after Beijing retaliated Friday, matching Trump's tariffs with its own 34% levy on all US imports starting April 10. China’s Commerce Ministry called it a direct response to the US's aggressive trade measures.Senior officials in Washington struck a defiant tone even as they confirmed outreach from dozens of countries. “More than 50 countries have reached out to the president to begin a negotiation,” said Kevin Hassett, head of the White House National Economic Council, noting that Vietnam had already requested a 45-day delay on tariffs.Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent added, “At this moment he’s created maximum leverage for himself... I think we’re going to have to see what the countries offer, and whether it’s believable.”Jerome Powell, Chair of the US Federal Reserve, warned the trade war could lead to “higher inflation and lower growth,” signalling limited room for interest rate cuts. Trump, however, fired back: “CUT INTEREST RATES, JEROME, AND STOP PLAYING POLITICS!”Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whose country was hit with 17% tariffs, was due in Washington Monday for emergency talks. UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, in an op-ed, warned that “the world as we knew it has gone,” and that future stability would depend on “deals and alliances.”Markets in Saudi Arabia, which remained open on Sunday, were also battered—plunging 6.78%, the worst daily loss since the pandemic. Australia’s Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said his government was bracing for more turmoil. “You can’t change global events. What you can do is prepare for them,” he said.Economists have warned that tariffs could trigger price hikes at home, a charge the Trump administration denies. “I don’t think that you’re going to see a big effect on the consumer in the US,” Hassett insisted.Larry Summers, former economic adviser to President Obama, said, “There is a very good chance there’s going to be more turbulence in markets the way we saw on Thursday and Friday.”Yet Trump struck an optimistic note. “THIS IS A GREAT TIME TO GET RICH,” he wrote on social media. He later added: “Some day people will realize that Tariffs, for the United States of America, are a very beautiful thing!”Wall Street, however, painted a bleaker picture. Companies deeply connected with China suffered severe losses—DuPont plunged 12.7% after Chinese regulators launched an anti-trust investigation, and GE Healthcare fell 16%, as 12% of its revenue comes from China.Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve faces a dilemma: rate cuts could cushion economic damage, but may also stoke inflation. Fed Chair Jerome Powell warned, “Our obligation is to keep longer-term inflation expectations well anchored... [and ensure] a one-time increase in the price level does not become an ongoing inflation problem.”","Tokyo's Nikkei 225 fell 7.1% in early trade after briefly plunging nearly 8%.

"Trump’s sweeping tariffs echo 1930s trade blunder, says Nate Silver",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/trumps-sweeping-tariffs-echo-1930s-trade-blunder-says-nate-silver/articleshow/120035027.cms,"File photo

Statistician and political analyst Nate Silver has sounded the alarm on President Donald Trump's sweeping new tariffs, warning that the aggressive trade policy could inflict deep damage on the US economy — and that Wall Street is already bracing for the impact.In a scathing post published Friday, Silver said the tariff package — which hits almost all of America’s major trading partners — echoes the disastrous Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930. But unlike the Great Depression-era law, Trump’s tariffs are “far more expansive and arbitrarily applied,” Silver wrote.He cited Vietnam as an example, a country now facing a 46% tariff despite being a key US ally in balancing China’s influence in Asia. “Vietnam is a strategic partner with low tariffs on American goods,” he noted, questioning the logic behind such blanket moves.Silver pointed to a sharp dip in major stock indices as a clear sign that investors are alarmed. He dismissed claims that the sell-off was triggered by unrelated economic concerns, saying sectors like consumer staples and cyclical industries — closely tied to everyday consumer spending — were hit hardest.“The stock market clearly thinks Trump’s tariffs will eat Main Street alive,” Silver said, using the title of his piece. He argued the moves could raise prices for consumers, disrupt supply chains, and ultimately tip the economy into recession.While the White House insists the tariffs are about fairness and protecting American industries, Silver’s message is clear: The markets aren’t buying it — and neither should the public.","Statistician and political analyst Nate Silver has sounded the alarm on President Donald Trump's sweeping new tariffs.

Singapore PM nails why Trump tariffs will throw world in turmoil,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-trade-moves-mark-seismic-shift-in-global-order-says-singapore-pm-lawrence-wong/articleshow/120031961.cms,"Prime Minister Lawrence Wong

[WATCH] Singapore must be clear-eyed about dangers ahead: PM Wong on implications of US tariffs

Singaporeans should prepare themselves for a period of growing volatility and uncertainty, Prime Minister Lawrence Wong said in a recent address, warning that the relative peace and order the world once enjoyed is unlikely to return soon.In a YouTube message released on Friday (April 4), he cautioned against complacency, noting the world is entering a ""troubled"" phase marked by rising protectionism and geopolitical tension .""We cannot expect that the rules which protected small states will still hold,"" Wong said, urging citizens to be mentally prepared. ""Let us not be lulled into complacency. The risks are real. The stakes are high.""His remarks followed a sweeping move by US President Donald Trump earlier in the week, in which the United States imposed steep new tariffs on nearly all its trading partners — triggering widespread retaliation and fears of a global trade war.""This latest move by the US leaves 'no room for doubt',"" Wong said. ""It marked a 'seismic change' in the global order, one where rules-based globalisation and free trade is over, to turn into one that is 'more arbitrary, protectionist, and dangerous'.""Although Singapore was hit with the lowest tier of tariffs — 10 per cent — the economic and strategic ramifications could be serious. Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade and Industry Gan Kim Yong echoed these concerns on Thursday, stating that while the direct impact may currently appear modest, Singapore ""may need to make adjustments in time to come.""He added that the government will roll out additional support measures if needed, stressing that “households and businesses have to be prepared for rough waters.”Wong underlined the urgency for Singapore to maintain its resilience by investing in its capabilities and strengthening its international alliances . ""We will stay vigilant. We will build up our capabilities. We will strengthen our network of partnerships with like-minded countries,"" he said. ""We are more ready than many other countries, with our reserves, our cohesion, and our resolve.""Senior Minister Lee Hsien Loong also addressed the growing concern, noting in a Facebook post that Singapore's economy is likely to feel the pain from these global developments. ""Our growth will be hurt, though it is too early to tell by how much,"" he wrote.Trump's tariff hikes include a 34 per cent duty on Chinese imports — which comes on top of a prior 20 per cent levy — raising the total tariff rate to a massive 54 per cent. Key allies and Asian economies were not spared, with the European Union hit with 20 per cent, Japan with 24 per cent, and India with 26 per cent.Vietnam faces a 46 per cent tariff, while countries like Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, Myanmar and Cambodia saw reciprocal tariffs ranging from 24 to 49 per cent. Though Singapore’s 10 per cent tier appears less aggressive, the knock-on effects on global supply chains are already beginning to concern local businesses and trade associations.""The WTO (World Trade Organization) system brought unprecedented stability and prosperity to the world – and to the US itself,"" said Wong. “To be clear, the system is not perfect. Singapore, and many others, have long called for reform – to update the rules and to make the system better. But what the US is doing now is not reform. It is abandoning the entire system it had created. Its new approach of reciprocal tariffs, country by country, is a complete rejection of the WTO framework.”Business leaders in Singapore are already warning of rising operational costs in the short term and growing fears of a US recession in the long run. Many are scrambling to reassess their outlook as global supply chains buckle under the weight of retaliatory trade measures.Wong acknowledged that some previously doubted his concerns over how the changing geopolitical order might disadvantage smaller economies. But now, he says, the dangers are becoming undeniable. ""I am sharing this with you so that we can all be mentally prepared,"" he said. ""So that we will not be caught off guard.""The last time such trade upheaval occurred, the consequences were devastating — escalating into global conflict in the 1930s. ""We risk being squeezed out, marginalised and left behind,"" Wong warned.As international norms erode and major powers prioritize narrow self-interest, Singapore will have to adapt quickly. “This is the harsh reality of the world today,” the Prime Minister said.","Singaporeans should prepare themselves for a period of growing volatility and uncertainty, Prime Minister Lawrence Wong said. He cautioned against complacency, noting the world is entering a ""troubled"" phase marked by rising protectionism and geopolitical tension.

This proactive strategy led to a 38.5% increase in exports to the US in December, 12.4% in January, and 34.6% in February.David Bailey, a business economics professor at the University of Birmingham, noted, ""This was manufacturers like JLR trying to get ahead of the game in terms of getting inventory to the US before the tariffs were implemented.""Despite these efforts, the new tariffs on vehicles could significantly affect the UK car industry's export strategy.

China issued a scathing rebuke to the United States over its tariff hike, accusing Washington of economic bullying and warning of serious consequences for the global trading system. The response came as a global stock markets tumbled, with China attributing the sharp declines to President Donald Trump's latest round of tariffs.China’s foreign ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun posted a screenshot on Facebook showing the Dow Jones, S&P 500, and Nasdaq all falling over 5% on Friday, adding the caption, “The market has spoken.” He called the trade war “unprovoked and unjustified” and urged the US to resolve trade disputes “through equal-footed consultation.”The S&P 500 dropped 6%, the Dow Jones fell 5.5%, and the Nasdaq plunged 5.8% — sharp sell-offs triggered by Trump’s aggressive tariff move, which China said has intensified an already escalating trade war.In response, China announced it will impose a 34% tariff on all US imports starting next week, joining a series of retaliatory actions. On Saturday night, Beijing escalated its criticism, issuing a strongly worded statement through the state-run Xinhua News Agency.“The US uses tariffs as a weapon to exert extreme pressure and seek private interests. This is a typical act of unilateralism, protectionism, and economic bullying,” the statement read. It accused Washington of “seriously violating WTO rules” and “damaging the rules-based multilateral trading system.”The statement added, “We do not provoke trouble, but we are not afraid of trouble. Pressure and threats are not the right way to deal with China.” It vowed that Beijing would continue to take “firm measures to safeguard its sovereignty, security, and development interests.”China also signalled it would not retreat from global engagement, pledging to pursue “high-level opening-up” despite mounting trade barriers. “Economic globalisation is the inevitable path for the development of human society,” it said. “The world needs justice, not tyranny.”","China issued a scathing rebuke to the United States over its tariff hike, accusing Washington of economic bullying.

JP Morgan predicts US recession by 2025-end due to Trump tariffs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/jp-morgan-predicts-us-recession-by-2025-end-due-to-trump-tariffs/articleshow/120000046.cms,"J P Morgan projected that the United States will slip into a recession by the end of 2025, attributing the decline largely to President Donald Trump's newly announced reciprocal tariffs. The forecast comes days after Trump imposed sweeping duties on imports in a bid to rebalance trade ties, with further hikes targeted at countries with major trade deficits with the US, including India.In a note released Friday, Michael Feroli, chief US economist at J P Morgan , wrote that America’s gross domestic product is likely to shrink ""under the weight of the tariffs."" He further warned that the resulting economic slowdown is expected to ""push the unemployment rate up to 5.3 [percent],"" according to The Hill.The concerns were echoed by US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, who said the tariffs could deal a heavier blow to the economy than previously estimated. Speaking at a business journalism conference on Friday, Powell said, ""While uncertainty remains elevated, it is now becoming clear that the tariff increases will be significantly larger than expected. The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth.""Under the new policy, a 10% tariff applies to all imports beginning April 5. From April 9, countries with the largest US trade deficits—India among them—will face higher, customised levies. India will see a 26% tariff on all its exports.Despite this sharp hike, brokerage firm Jefferies said the effect on India’s outbound trade may be limited. In a client note, the firm pointed out that major Indian export sectors—such as IT services, pharmaceuticals, and automobiles—are not directly hit by the tariff escalation.“The 27 per cent (now corrected in a document to 26 per cent) tariff on India is looking reasonable from a relative perspective.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Space sector start-up Sisir Radar to develop SAR on L/P band SAR,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/space-sector-start-up-sisir-radar-to-develop-sar-on-l/p-band-sar/articleshow/104558111.cms,"CHENNAI: Space sector startup, Sisir Radar Private Ltd has hit success at the prestigious iDEX DefSpace Challenge with its projects for development of “L/P band Continuous Wave SAR (synthetic aperture radar) payload for LEO Small Satellites” and “Unfurlable, Electronically Steering Antenna for L/P band SAR payload” for Indian Air Force (IAF), said a top company official.The company is promoted by former Director at the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) Tapan Misra and the brains behind the Indian space agency’s RISAT series of SAR satellites as well as the Dual Frequency SAR on the Chandrayaan 2 orbiter that is currently circling the moon.""A grant of Rs 3 crore is also there for development of the products,"" Misra told IANS.Synthetic Aperture Radar or SAR is a special kind of imaging radar technology that can provide extremely accurate high resolution imagery of the terrain through clouds, smoke and dust even in pitch dark conditions. SAR imagery provides much higher resolution than other forms of remote sensing technology such as hyperspectral and multispectral. SAR is a critical technology for strategic reconnaissance and planning as well as for disaster management.According to Misra, winning the challenge in just over a year of floating the company is a major booster.He said L and P band SAR have an advantage over other frequencies (like X band) when it comes to penetration capabilities through rain, clouds, foliage and vegetation in a tropical country like India, and underground penetration capabilities in dry terrain.Continuing further, he said the L band SAR will provide 1 metre resolution, spotlight resolution in Stripmap mode. The current industry standard is 5-10 metre in L band. Misra said both the L and P band will operate simultaneously from a satellite borne SAR. Recently, Sisir Radar successfully developed and tested the world’s highest resolution L-Band SAR fitted on a drone. With 0.2 metre resolution, this is by far the highest L band SAR in the world, he said.","Space sector startup, Sisir Radar Private Ltd has hit success at the prestigious iDEX DefSpace Challenge.

Explainer: What is 'Hindu rate of growth' and why Raghuram Rajan's remarks may be 'premature',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/explainer-what-is-hindu-rate-of-growth-and-why-raghuram-rajans-remarks-may-be-premature/articleshow/98482598.cms,"What is meant by Hindu growth rate

How India's GDP has been growing

What SBI report said on savings and investment

Incremental capital output ratio

NEW DELHI: India's gross domestic product (GDP) data for the third quarter (October-December 2022) received a word of caution from the former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan In an interview with news agency PTI, Rajan that India is ""dangerously close"" to the Hindu rate of growth in view of subdued private sector investment, high interest rates and slowing global growth.India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying"".However, a report released by the State Bank of India (SBI) economists on Tuesday dismissed arguments that India is dangerously close to Hindu rate of growth saying such statements are ""ill-conceived, biased and premature"".The term 'Hindu growth rate' was coined by late economist Raj Krishna in 1978 to describe the slow growth in the country.It basically refers to the low pace of economic growth rates during 1950s to 1980s. During this period, the Indian economy averaged 3.5%.A former lecturer at the Delhi School of Economics (DSE), Krishna noted that only if the rate of growth is persistently slow and accompanied by low per-capita GDP, then it will be known as Hindu rate of growth but it has to factor in population growth as well.Before economic reforms of 1991, India's economic growth remained stagnant and low, while per capita income averaged around 1.3%. Krishna termed this low growth situation to be a result of socialist policies of state control and import substitution.However, the economic situation changed when liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation (LPG) reforms came into effect in the year 1991, at a time when India faced balance of payment crisis.Over the years, many economists have strongly opposed the idea of 'Hindu growth rate' and the term never had universal acceptance.The Indian economy plunged into its very first technical recession in FY21 due to the impact of Covid-19 pandemic and the related nationwide lockdowns. GDP shrunk by an unprecedented 23.8% in the first quarter of the financial year 2020-21. However, due to spurt in economic activities in the subsequent quarters, the GDP decline started to narrow.However, if we look at the period before Covid-19 as well, India's growth curve shows a declining trend.From 8.26% in FY17, GDP growth plunged to 3.74% in FY20. Shutdown of economic activities in FY21 in wake of Covid-19 only made matters worse.As lockdowns started to ease and business activities resumed, India's GDP also started rising. In Q1 of FY22, growth jumped to 20.1% mainly on account of low base effect. By the fourth quarter of FY22, growth came down to 4.10%.Similarly, the new financial year 2022-23 brought fresh economic challenges in the form of Russia-Ukraine war that impacted almost all major economies of the world, slowed the pace of growth, pushed inflation to record highs.As a result, the central banks of all advanced economies spurred into action and opted for monetary policy tightening to curb the soaring inflation.With persistently rising interest rates, India's economy grew by 4.4% in Q3 of FY23, as the Centre revised upwards GDP growth for previous year to 9.10% from 8.7% earlier.The report weighed recent GDP numbers against the available data on savings and investments for the past decade and highlighted some interesting points.""Quarterly growth numbers are noisy and should be best avoided for any serious interpretation (on an average, India's GDP growth has witnessed Rs 2 lakh crore upward revision for the 3 year ended FY23),"" the report said.Gross capital formation (GCF) by the government touched a high of 11.8% in 2021-22, up from 10.7% in 2020-21.""This also had a domino effect on private sector investment that jumped from 10 per cent to 10.8% over the same period,"" it said.In fact, Ecowrap added that the trends in GCF to gross output ratio or the plough back of funds for creation of fresh capacity shows that for public administration the ratio attained fresh peak in 2021-22 owing to the emphasis on capital expenditure in recent budgets.At the aggregate level, gross capital formation is supposed to have crossed 32% in 2022-23, the highest level since 2018-19.According to the report, in 2021-22, gross savings have risen to 30% from 29% in 2020-21.""The ratio is supposed to have crossed 31 per cent in 2022-23, the highest since 2018-19. The household savings increased sharply during the pandemic period on account of sharp accretion in financial savings such as deposits,"" said the report by SBI's Economic Research Department.While household financial savings have since then moderated from 15.4% in 2020-21 to 11.1% in 2022-23, savings in physical assets have grown sharply to 11.8% in 2021-22 from 10.7% in 2020-21.The report further analysed Incremental Capital Output ratio (ICOR) -- which measures additional units of capital (investment) needed to produce additional units of output. It said that the ratio has been improving.""ICOR which was 7.5 in FY 12 is now only 3.5 in FY22. Clearly, only half of capital is now needed for next unit of output,"" the report noted.Such reducing ICOR in the current years reflects a relatively increasing efficiency of capital and shows that the economy is on a sound footing, the report said.""From that point of view, future GDP growth rates even at 7% could still mean a decent number by any standards!,"" it added.","India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.

An employee is entitled for a 50 per cent amount of the last drawn salary as pension.OPS was discontinued by the NDA government in 2003 with effect from April 1, 2004.Under the new pension scheme (NPS), employees contribute 10 per cent of their basic salary towards pension while the government contributes 14 per cent.Governments of Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand have informed the central government/ Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority ( PFRDA about their decision to restart OPS for their employees.The government of Punjab on November 18, 2022, issued a notification regarding implementation of OPS for the state government employees who are being covered under NPS. Jharkhand too has decided to revert to OPS.",Former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan has expressed his concern over the decision of some states to restart the old pension scheme.

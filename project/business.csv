US Federal Reserve keeps benchmark rate unchanged in 4.25-4.5% target range at Jerome Powell-led FOMC meet,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-federal-reserve-fomc-meet-jerome-powell-donald-trump-monetary-policy-america-central-bank-rate-inflation-tariffs/articleshow/120972001.cms,"US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell (AP Photo)

The US Federal Reserve , led by chair Jerome Powell , kept benchmark rate unchanged in 4.25-4.5% target range at the FOMC meet on Wednesday. ""The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. Uncertainty about the economic outlook has increased further. The Committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate and judges that the risks of higher unemployment and higher inflation have risen,"" the FOMC statement read.""Although swings in net exports have affected the data, recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace. The unemployment rate has stabilized at a low level in recent months, and labor market conditions remain solid. Inflation remains somewhat elevated,"" the release read.""In support of its goals, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 4-1/4 to 4-1/2 percent. In considering the extent and timing of additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. The Committee will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage‑backed securities.The Committee is strongly committed to supporting maximum employment and returning inflation to its 2 percent objective,"" the central bank added.The Federal Reserve was confronted with a challenging decision regarding its response to President Donald Trump 's tariff implementation: Should it maintain high interest rates to address inflation, remain inactive, or reduce rates to boost growth and employment?Market observers and financial experts had largely anticipated that the Fed will maintain current rates, adopting a wait-and-see approach to evaluate the economic impact of the new tariffs before implementing any changes.The US central bank operates independently under a Congressional mandate to ensure price stability and optimal employment levels, primarily through adjustments to its key short-term lending rate.""It's an unfavorable mix for the Federal Reserve,"" Nationwide chief economist Kathy Bostjancic had told AFP.""They're going to see upward price pressures at the same time when economic growth is slowing,"" she said. ""And then they'll have to put a weight on what do they believe?""Last month, Trump implemented substantial tariffs on Chinese imports and reduced ""baseline"" duties of 10 percent on products from most nations, leading to several weeks of market volatility.The administration imposed increased duties on numerous trading associates, subsequently halting them until July to allow the United States sufficient time to revise current trade agreements.Recent economic indicators suggest a decline in the first quarter, with both consumers and companies increasing their import purchases before the implementation of new regulations.Simultaneously, employment figures remained near record-low levels, whilst inflation rates moved towards, but stayed marginally higher than, the Federal Reserve's established two percent objective.","US Federal Reserve kept benchmark rate unchanged in 4.25-4.5% target range at the FOMC meet on Wednesday.

After completing its 24k target and reclaiming above the 200 DMA, this is the third consecutive day wherein the index has closed above the same after a 10% flash rally. Given the geopolitical developments and a stretched rally looking tired on charts, we shift our stance to sideways from buy on dip with a short term support seen at 23900 below which weakening momentum could pick up. Despite a strong handover from global front this morning, charts do not warrant for an immediate upside after a flash rally seen in the past 10 trading days.Bank Nifty continued to lead the charge amongst the widely tracked indices with staging a 1800 odd point rally for this week at yesterday’s high. An additional 2000 points targets had opened up on charts after its strong closing on Thursday. Yesterday was the first instance since the panic lows of 7th April that Bank Nifty underperformed Nifty marking an end to its upper hand in this leg.Any closing below 55240 is likely to drag the index on a negative momentum from here on. We shall further the case after Bank Nifty’s reaction near the 56200 levels, as it looks extremely overbought daily and hourly charts.Stock has found strong support from its 5 year trendline earlier this month and this is its 6th touch base on this trendline in the past 5 years , making it all the more stronger. On the short term the 200 DMA has also been reclaimed along with the index as this helps in establishing its short term trend northwards.QSR stocks had been sliding since the start of this calendar year. Marking an end to the slide, JUBLFOOD has given a breakout of a 3 month long correction while making a higher bottom formation all through past 4 weeks. A quick 6-8% upside follows through this breakout on the stock.Stock has closed at a fresh 22 month high with repeated lower high formation suggesting accumulation on every dips being observed. The scrip has held its neck above its 200 DMA as well as 200 WMA for the past 8-10 weeks now suggesting that its short term as well as medium term trend has now been established northwards and dips are likely to get bought into.","According to Aakash K Hindocha, Ambuja Cements, Jubilant FoodWorks Ltd, and SBI Cards and Payment Services are the top buy calls for today.

Insurers include the war risks through an endorsement by charging additional premium. Usually, when geopolitical tensions rise, insurers hike the war risk premium on cargo. War risk premiums are typically subject to reinsurance arrangements that insurers have with their respective reinsurers.

EU prepares tariffs on Boeing jets as transatlantic aerospace trade tensions flare,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/eu-prepares-tariffs-on-boeing-jets-as-transatlantic-aerospace-trade-tensions-flare/articleshow/120971635.cms,"Aerospace companies are bracing for a potential escalation in trade tensions as the European Union prepares to target Boeing jets with retaliatory tariffs in response to existing US import duties on European goods, including Airbus aircraft, according to industry sources.The anticipated measures, expected to be announced Thursday by the European Commission, come as part of a broader plan to counter 10% US tariffs impacting around $100 billion in European exports. The move would mark the first significant tariff action between the EU and US aerospace sectors since 2021, reviving trade friction in the $150 billion global aircraft industry.EU Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic, speaking in Singapore on Wednesday, confirmed news agency Reuters that the bloc would unveil its planned counter-measures if ongoing negotiations with Washington fail to ease tensions. The Financial Times earlier reported that the EU intends to include civil aircraft—namely Boeing jets—on its tariff list.The European Commission and Boeing declined to comment on the developments.Currently, the EU faces 25% US tariffs on steel, aluminum, and automobiles, along with 10% reciprocal tariffs on other goods, including aircraft—a figure that could double to 20% after US President Donald Trump's temporary 90-day suspension expires on July 8.The stakes are high for European airlines, many of which have placed large orders with Boeing. A potential hike in aircraft prices due to new levies could upend fleet planning and financial forecasts.Despite the looming tariff clash, aerospace rivals Boeing and Airbus have adopted a more unified stance compared to earlier disputes. During the 2020–2021 trade war centered on World Trade Organization subsidy cases, both companies found themselves at the heart of tit-for-tat tariffs. Now, industry leaders on both sides of the Atlantic are urging a return to tariff-free aerospace trade.Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury recently advocated for restoring duty-free trading, warning that escalating tariffs would leave ""only losers"" in the industry. He pointed to the previous tariff sequence that ultimately resulted in a truce and emphasized the need to avoid repeating that cycle.Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg echoed similar sentiments in a Congressional hearing last month, reiterating the company's commitment to free trade and calling for a resolution to the growing trade dispute.The broader aerospace sector has pushed for the revival of a 1979 international agreement among 33 countries that exempted aircraft and parts from tariffs—an arrangement that once underpinned global aerospace trade.Yet, the uncertainty has already begun to impact market behaviour. Ireland’s Ryanair, a major Boeing customer, has threatened to cancel hundreds of aircraft orders if new tariffs drive prices higher, warning it would seek to hold Boeing contractually accountable for any fallout from European countermeasures. However, with Airbus production slots sold out for much of the decade and strict terms limiting cancellations, analysts say carriers may find little room to maneuver.In the US, Delta Air Lines has signaled it may delay deliveries of Airbus jets built in Europe should the trade conflict persist, underscoring the ripple effects tariffs could have across the global aviation market.","EU to target Boeing jets with retaliatory tariffs in response to existing US import duties on European goods.

"Google's parent company Alphabet shares plunge over 8% amid AI search competition, malware threats",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/googles-parent-company-alphabet-shares-plunge-over-5-amid-ai-search-competition-malware-threats/articleshow/120970730.cms,"Photo credit - AP

Shares of Alphabet Inc., the parent company of Google, plunged more than 5% on Wednesday following revelations from a federal antitrust trial and developments tied to cybersecurity and energy infrastructure.As of 12:17 p.m., Alphabet Inc.'s Class C stock was trading at $151.41, marking a sharp decline of $13.79 or 8.35% for the day.At the heart of the market reaction was testimony by Eddy Cue, Apple’s senior vice president of services, who told a Washington court that Google’s search traffic on Apple products declined last month. Cue attributed the drop to growing competition from AI-powered search alternatives such as ChatGPT and Perplexity, signalling a potential shift in user behaviour away from traditional search engines.""That has never happened in 20 years,"" legal news outlet MLex quoted him as saying.Cue was giving testimony in a trial in which US Judge Amit Mehta will determine how Google must address his landmark ruling last year that it operates an illegal monopoly in online search.The Apple executive's remarks saw Google's market capitalization wiped of $140 billion since the close of trading on Wall Street on Tuesday.The marathon court case has revealed that Google pays Apple tens of billions of dollars every year in a revenue sharing agreement in which Google's search engine is set as the default on Apple's Safari browser.Markets were also rattled by Cue's comment that ""over the coming year we will add other (AI) choices to the search engine choice in the browser, because I think those products are getting better and better,"" he said, according to MLex.Meanwhile, Google disclosed it has identified a new strain of malware dubbed “LOSTKEYS,” linked to the Russia-based hacking group Cold River. According to Wesley Shields of the Google Threat Intelligence Group, the malware is capable of stealing files and transmitting system information to attackers. Shields noted that LOSTKEYS represents a new advancement in Cold River’s arsenal.Cold River, which has ties to Russia’s Federal Security Service, has been associated with numerous cyber campaigns targeting high-profile Western individuals and organizations, including NATO governments, NGOs, former intelligence officers, and individuals with connections to Ukraine. Recent activity from the group was observed as recently as January, March, and April 2025. A notable past operation included the targeting of US nuclear research labs in 2022 and the leak of private emails from former British intelligence chief Richard Dearlove.Meanwhile, Google announced a major partnership with nuclear developer Elementl Power to construct three advanced nuclear power plants in the United States. Each facility is expected to produce at least 600 megawatts of electricity—enough to power a large-scale data center—as tech companies scramble to meet the surging energy demands brought on by the generative AI boom.Google will provide early-stage capital for the projects, which will be developed in collaboration with utility and regulatory partners to secure appropriate locations. Amanda Peterson Corio, Google's Global Head of Data Center Energy, said the initiative reinforces the company’s goal of strengthening the energy grid. She emphasized that advanced nuclear energy offers “reliable, baseload, 24/7 energy” crucial for supporting AI and innovation.The International Energy Agency (IEA) forecasts that electricity usage by data centres will more than double by 2030, posing significant challenges to power infrastructure—challenges this partnership seeks to address.","Alphabet Inc.'s Class C stock was trading at $151.41, marking a sharp decline of $13.79 or 8.35% for the day.

World Bank approves $1 billion loan to Sri Lanka for economic recovery,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/world-bank-approves-1-billion-loan-to-sri-lanka-for-economic-recovery/articleshow/120970181.cms,"The World Bank has approved a $1 billion loan to Sri Lanka on Wednesday in order to revive the country's agriculture, tourism, and energy sectors after 2022 economic crisis, news agency AFP reported.Sri Lanka's economy collapsed in 2022 after it exhausted its foreign reserves, leaving it unable to import essential goods like food, fuel, and medicine. The financial meltdown triggered widespread protests, eventually leading to the resignation of then-President Gotabaya Rajapaksa. His successor, Ranil Wickremesinghe, secured a $2.9 billion bailout from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), helping stabilize revenues and allowing for a restructuring of the country’s $46 billion in foreign debt following its default in April 2022.The World Bank’s new loan, to be disbursed over three years, is designed to boost local industries and attract private investment, the Bank said in a statement following a meeting between World Bank President Ajay Banga and Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake in Colombo.“With progress underway to stabilize the economy and restart growth, core elements for job creation are in place,” Banga stated.He emphasized that now is the time to push ahead with reforms and create conditions that support private enterprise, especially in sectors with high employment potential.Despite signs of recovery, the World Bank recently warned that poverty remains widespread across the country.Sri Lanka's economy registered 5.0% growth in 2024 — surpassing the Bank’s earlier projection of 4.4% and marking its first year of expansion since the crisis.The IMF cautioned that the country’s recovery could be jeopardized if the US reinstates punitive tariffs. The United States is Sri Lanka’s largest export market, accounting for nearly 25% of its $12 billion in merchandise exports. A 44% ""reciprocal tariff"" imposed by Washington was temporarily suspended for 90 days, and Colombo has appealed for negotiations rather than retaliation.","Sri Lanka's economy collapsed in 2022 after it exhausted its foreign reserves.

The Nasdaq composite was mostly unchanged, held back by losses in several major technology stocks.Broad gains were seen across sectors, with approximately 85% of S&P 500 components advancing. However, the rise was tempered by sharp declines in tech heavyweights—Google dropped 3.8% and Apple lost 1.8%.Shares of The Walt Disney Co. surged 10.8% after the company topped analyst earnings expectations, raised its profit forecast, and announced it had added more than a million new streaming subscribers.The upbeat report from Disney came amid broader investor concerns that new tariffs could dent consumer spending, posing risks for industries tied to discretionary spending such as entertainment and travel.President Donald Trump’s unpredictable trade policies have led many companies to cut or withdraw their financial forecasts for the year.Super Micro Computer fell 6.6% after the server manufacturer reduced its revenue forecast due to economic uncertainty.Meanwhile, chipmaker Marvell Technology declined 9.4% after postponing its planned investor day because of similar concerns.Tech firms remain particularly vulnerable to the escalating trade dispute between the US and China. Tariffs on Chinese goods have reached 145%, while China’s tariffs on US goods now stand at 125%.Still, there’s potential for progress. Top US officials are scheduled to meet with a high-level Chinese delegation in Switzerland this weekend. At the same time, China is preparing to cut interest rates and take additional steps to mitigate the economic strain caused by the ongoing tariff battle.Wall Street is also anticipating the Federal Reserve’s next move on interest rates. The central bank is expected to keep its benchmark rate unchanged. Fed Chair Jerome Powell and other officials have signaled they are waiting to assess how tariffs might affect inflation and economic activity.The Fed cut rates three times in 2024 as inflation neared its 2% target, but has since adopted a more cautious stance due to persistent inflation slightly above that level and renewed trade-related risks.“The Fed wants to see how tariffs impact consumer prices and the economy,” analysts noted.In March, the US trade deficit hit a record $140.5 billion as consumers and businesses ramped up imports ahead of tariffs scheduled for April and postponed levies set to take effect in July. The US economy contracted at an annual rate of 0.3% in the first quarter, driven in part by the import surge. Consumer confidence has also declined in recent weeks.Despite those challenges, employment remains solid—though the latest data does not yet reflect the full impact of the upcoming tariffs.Treasury yields remained relatively stable. The yield on the 10-year Treasury slipped to 4.28% from 4.30% on Tuesday.European markets mostly retreated, while shares in Asia rose earlier in the day.","The S&P 500 gained 0.4% in afternoon trading, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 375 points.

Global stock markets showed mixed performance on Wednesday as investors awaited the US Federal Reserve’s policy announcement, widely expected to leave interest rates unchanged, despite renewed pressure from former President Donald Trump to cut borrowing costs.In Europe, Germany’s DAX was nearly flat at 23,250.56, while France’s CAC 40 slipped 0.5% to 7,661.64. London’s FTSE 100 fell 0.3% to 8,573.67. Meanwhile, futures for the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average each gained around 0.6%.Asian markets saw modest gains following news that the US and China plan to resume trade talks in Switzerland later this week. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index initially surged more than 2% after Beijing introduced interest rate cuts and other stimulus measures aimed at mitigating the impact of higher tariffs imposed by Trump on Chinese exports. However, gains were largely subdued by market close.Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 edged down 0.1% to 36,779.66, while the Hang Seng finished just 0.1% higher at 22,691.88. The Shanghai Composite Index rose 0.8% to 3,342.67.According to Lynne Song of ING Economics, the timing of China's economic measures may be linked to the upcoming trade discussions. “This way, the easing won’t be seen as a knee-jerk reaction to tariffs. Policymakers are likely now privy to some of the early data on how the economy is being impacted by the tariff shock,” she said.Still, analysts noted that market reactions were restrained, partly due to a lack of substantial government spending initiatives. “These will help to shore up growth at the margin. But any boost to credit demand will be modest and today’s moves are no substitute for an expansion in fiscal support,” said Julian Evans-Pritchard of Capital Economics.Elsewhere in Asia, Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 rose 0.3% to 8,178.30, and South Korea’s Kospi added 0.6% to close at 2,573.80.On Wall Street, US stocks closed lower Tuesday amid earnings reports showing companies holding back on future profit forecasts due to tariff-related uncertainty. The S&P 500 fell 0.8%, its second consecutive loss after a nine-day winning streak—the longest in over two decades. The Dow dropped 0.9%, and the Nasdaq slid 0.9%.Among major decliners, Palantir Technologies dropped 12% after failing to meet investor expectations, reflecting broader skepticism toward AI-related stocks after significant rallies. Palantir's shares, still near $110, had traded around $20 less than a year ago.Ongoing tariff uncertainty is also dampening consumer confidence and long-term purchasing plans, fueling a surge in imports as businesses rush to beat future tariffs. The US trade deficit hit a record $140.5 billion in March, with the economy shrinking 0.3% in Q1 due to the import surge.Companies like DoorDash are feeling the pinch. The delivery firm’s shares fell 7.4% after reporting revenue below analyst expectations.In bond markets, the yield on the 10-year US Treasury rose to 4.32% from 4.31% a day earlier.Oil prices ticked up, with US benchmark crude adding 54 cents to $59.63 per barrel and Brent crude gaining 44 cents to reach $62.57 per barrel.In currency trading, the dollar strengthened to 143.39 Japanese yen from 142.41 yen, while the euro dipped to $1.1348 from $1.1369.","Global stock markets showed mixed performance on Wednesday as investors awaited the US Federal Reserve’s policy announcement.

For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of carbon use per year.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.","Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain.

Testify: Sam Bankman-Fried acknowledges 'mistakes' but testifies he did not defraud anyone,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/cryptocurrency/sam-bankman-fried-acknowledges-mistakes-but-testifies-he-did-not-defraud-anyone/articleshow/104761929.cms,"<p>Sam Bankman-Fried (File Photo- Reuters)<br></p>

NEW YORK: Sam Bankman-Fried , testifying in his own defense at his fraud trial on Friday, acknowledged that a ""lot of people got hurt"" when the FTX cryptocurrency exchange he founded collapsed, but said he did not defraud anyone or take customer funds.Shortly after taking the witness stand in Manhattan federal court, Bankman-Fried said he made ""a number of small mistakes and a number of larger mistakes"" while running the now-bankrupt exchange. The biggest mistake, he said, was not implementing a dedicated risk management team.""We thought that we might be able to build the best product on the market,"" Bankman-Fried said. ""It turned out basically the opposite of that. A lot of people got hurt - customers, employees - and the company ended up in bankruptcy.""Prosecutors accuse Bankman-Fried of using FTX customer funds to prop up his crypto-focused hedge fund, Alameda Research, make speculative venture investments and donate more than $100 million to US political campaigns. He also faces charges of scheming to cheat Alameda's lenders and FTX investors.He has pleaded not guiltyBankman-Fried's trial, which began on October 3, is drawing to a close nearly a year after FTX collapsed amid a wave of customer withdrawals. The company declared bankruptcy in November 2022 and Bankman-Fried was indicted the following month.His testimony marked the first time the dozen jurors and five alternates have heard directly from the 31-year-old former billionaire after 12 trial days.Bankman-Fried, who was jailed in August after US District Judge Lewis Kaplan found he likely tampered with witnesses, wore a suit and spoke with two water bottles placed in front of him on the witness stand. The former mogul once known for wearing shorts and T-shirts and sporting an unkempt mop of curly locks cut his hair before his trial began.Responding to questions posed by his defense lawyer Mark Cohen, Bankman-Fried spoke in calm, measured tones during the first portion of his testimony as he recounted founding Alameda in 2017, shortly after graduating from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, despite knowing little about crypto.But Bankman-Fried - who had studied physics and worked as a quantitative trader at Jane Street - said he saw opportunities for ""arbitrage"" in the market for digital assets. He said Alameda's first office was in a small Airbnb in Berkeley, California, before he later moved the firm to Hong Kong.""We wanted to be under the radar at that point in time,"" he said on the stand, adding he named the hedge fund after the California county where it was founded in part so competitors would not discover what they were doing.Jurors have heard from three of his closest confidantes at FTX and Alameda, all of whom have pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors. They testified earlier this month that they committed financial crimes at Bankman-Fried's behest.For criminal defendants, taking the stand is a risky proposition because it opens them up to potentially probing cross-examination by prosecutors.But given Bankman-Fried's penchant for risk, legal experts say he likely viewed taking the stand as his best shot to counter the allegations made by members of his inner circle, which were backed up by spreadsheets the three said demonstrated how customer funds were stolen and text messages in which they discussed FTX's shortfall of funds with Bankman-Fried.","Sam Bankman-Fried says he made ""a number of small mistakes and a number of larger mistakes"" while running the now-bankrupt exchange.

The tech and regulations underpinning it are evolving so rapidly, it is difficult for even technologists to often make sense of it.Crypto assets and crypto currencies are based on blockchain tech, which is a form of distributed ledger technology that stores data on thousands of data servers around the world, as opposed to today where data is stored only in one place or clustered in a few locations. This data is open, meaning it can be viewed and verified by anyone taking part in that particular system. What this means practically is that an individual can transfer crypto assets without the help of intermediaries, say, banks or government agencies, thereby ensuring privacy, speed and lower costs.The first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin , was created with anonymity in mind, it was a way for people to conduct financial transactions away from the prying eyes of governments. While it went on to become a speculative asset, today, crypto, and the underlying blockchain technology, has a far more ambitious goal – the transformation of the internet.CoinDCX CTO Vivek Gupta says this technology can help usher in Web 3. 0 – a decentralised form of the internet where users can actually monetise their time spent online. “Whatever Web3 use case you may be driving, the value that comes from it must be distributed, and you cannot distribute that without crypto. For something as simple as depositing money in a pool and getting a receipt token, that receipt token is a crypto. That’s the proof that I have deposited the money. Without crypto there is no Web3 use case,” he says.Decentralised finance (DeFi) is a huge part of what makes blockchain tech so disruptive. Imagine being able to lend your money to strangers on the internet and get paid an interest. Or imagine spending time on socialmedia platforms or playing video games and getting paid for your time spent by someone who needs data about you. Web3 makes this possible because the data isn’t controlled by any one company or country.Decentralised apps (dApps) are another Web3 feature. Unlike traditional apps hosted on centralised servers, dApps operate on a peer-to-peer network and utilisethe consensus mechanism and transparency features of blockchain technology.“I see a big disruption coming, especially in the DeFi tokenisation space and the whole content creator economy,” says Ravi Chamria, co-founder & CEO of Zeeve, a blockchain automation platform.Ashish Singhal, co-founder & CEO of CoinSwitch, says the tech can revolutionise how we conduct business, store data, and even vote, since the tech allows people to verify data of any kind efficiently.Governments are worried about what crypto could mean for monetary policy, for their ability to regulate people’s lives. But disruption hardly ever requires consensus. If a new technology proves to be better than an old one, people will drift towards it.Central banks have recognised the importance of the technology and some are creating Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) that are based on blockchain technology. “There’s a lot of activity happening in the regulated DeFi space. Looking at the future, we think guardrails are probably a good thing to have around these sorts of technologies,” says Andrew Vranjes, VP of sales at Blockdaemon, a blockchain infrastructure platform.Cryptocurrencies too are rapidly changing. Where before the value of cryptocurrencies were based on what people were willing to pay for them, today there are crypto assets that are backed by real world assets like equity and real estate. Silvina Moschini’s Unicoin is one of them. “It is an assets backed, audited, SEC-compliant cryptocurrency,” she says.","Crypto assets and crypto currencies are based on blockchain tech, which is a form of distributed ledger technology that stores data on thousands of data servers around the world.

"US tightens crackdown on crypto with lawsuits against Coinbase, Binance",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/cryptocurrency/bitcoin/us-tightens-crackdown-on-crypto-with-lawsuits-against-coinbase-binance/articleshow/100810119.cms,"BROKER, EXCHANGE CRACKDOWN



NEW YORK: The top U.S. securities regulator sued cryptocurrency platform Coinbase on Tuesday, the second lawsuit in two days against a major crypto exchange, in a dramatic escalation of a crackdown on the industry and one that could dramatically transform a market that has largely operated outside regulation.The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Monday took aim at Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange. The SEC accuses Binance and its CEO Changpeng Zhao of operating a ""web of deception"".If successful, the lawsuits could transform the crypto market by successfully asserting the SEC's jurisdiction over the industry which for years has argued that tokens do not constitute securities and should not be regulated by the SEC.""The two cases are different, but overlap and point in the same direction: the SEC's increasingly aggressive campaign to bring cryptocurrencies under the jurisdiction of the federal securities laws,"" said Kevin O'Brien, a partner at Ford O'Brien Landy and a former federal prosecutor, adding, however, that the SEC has not previously taken on such major crypto players.""If the SEC prevails in either case, the cryptocurrency industry will be transformed.""In its complaint filed in Manhattan federal court, the SEC said Coinbase has since at least 2019 made billions of dollars by operating as a middleman on crypto transactions, while evading disclosure requirements meant to protect investors.The SEC said Coinbase traded at least 13 crypto assets that are securities that should have been registered, including tokens such as Solana, Cardano and Polygon.Coinbase suffered about $1.28 billion of net customer outflows following the lawsuit, according to initial estimates from data firm Nansen. Shares of Coinbase's parent Coinbase Global Inc closed down $7.10, or 12.1%, at $51.61 after earlier falling as much as 20.9%. They are up 46% this year.Paul Grewal, Coinbase's general counsel, in a statement said the company will continue operating as usual and has ""demonstrated commitment to compliance.""Oanda senior market analyst Ed Moya said the SEC ""looks like it's playing Whac-A-Mole with crypto exchanges,"" and because most exchanges offer a range of tokens that operate on blockchain protocols targeted by regulators, ""it seems like this is just the beginning.""Leading cryptocurrency bitcoin has been a paradoxical beneficiary of the crackdown.After an initial plunge to a nearly three-month low of $25,350 following the Binance suit, bitcoin rebounded by more than $2,000, exceeding the previous day's high. It was trading just below $27,000 at 0410 GMT.""The SEC is making life nearly impossible for several altcoins and that is actually driving some crypto traders back into bitcoin,"" explained Oanda's Moya.Securities, as opposed to other assets such as commodities, are strictly regulated and require detailed disclosures to inform investors of potential risks. The Securities Act of 1933 outlined a definition of the term ""security,"" yet many experts rely on two U.S. Supreme Court cases to determine if an investment product constitutes a security.SEC Chair Gary Gensler has long said tokens constitute securities and has steadily asserted its authority over the crypto market, focusing initially on the sale of tokens and interest-bearing crypto products. More recently, it has taken aim at unregistered crypto broker dealer, exchange trading and clearing activity.While a few crypto companies are licensed as alternative system trading systems, a type of trading platform used by brokers to trade listed securities, no crypto platform operates as a full-blown stock exchange. The SEC also this year sued Beaxy Digital and Bittrex Global for failing to register as an exchange, clearing house and broker.""The whole business model is built on a noncompliance with the U.S. securities laws and we're asking them to come into compliance,"" Gensler told CNBC.Crypto companies refute that tokens meet the definition of a security, say the SEC's rules are ambiguous, and that the SEC is overstepping its authority in trying to regulate them. Still, many companies have boosted compliance, shelved products and expanded outside the country in response to the crackdown.Kristin Smith, CEO of the Blockchain Association trade group, rejected Gensler's efforts to oversee the industry.""We're confident the courts will prove Chair Gensler wrong in due time,"" she said.Founded in 2012, Coinbase recently served more than 108 million customers and ended March with $130 billion of customer crypto assets and funds on its balance sheet. Transactions generated 75% of its $3.15 billion of net revenue last year.Tuesday's SEC lawsuit seeks civil fines, the recouping of ill-gotten gains and injunctive relief.On Monday, the SEC accused Binance of inflating trading volumes, diverting customer funds, improperly commingling assets, failing to restrict U.S. customers from its platform, and misleading customers about its controls.Binance pledged to vigorously defend itself against the lawsuit, which it said reflected the SEC's ""misguided and conscious refusal"" to provide clarity to the crypto industry.Customers pulled around $790 million from Binance and its U.S. affiliate following the lawsuit, Nansen said.On Tuesday, the SEC filed a motion to freeze assets belonging to Binance.US, Binance's U.S. affiliate. The holding company of Binance is based in the Cayman Islands.""It's important to note that recent regulatory actions are aimed at ensuring that companies operating in the cryptocurrency industry are complying with securities laws and protecting investors - this will always be their goal,"" said Joshua Chu, group chief risk officer at blockchain technology firms XBE, Coinllectibles and Marvion.""These events will ultimately lead to a more stable and trustworthy industry, which could help to attract more institutional investors and mainstream adoption.""","The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Monday took aim at Binance. The SEC accuses Binance and its CEO Changpeng Zhao of operating a ""web of deception"" If successful, the lawsuits could transform the crypto market by successfully asserting the SEC's jurisdiction over the industry.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-100810085,imgsize-36192,width-400,resizemode-4/100810085.jpg"

""As of now we are not in active negotiations (with Rosneft) but we are open to it. There is no mandate (to buy from the US).

The plan is to reset interest rates annually by benchmarking them to rates in other countries that Indian exports are competing with. The decision flows from the realisation within govt that interest rates in India are twice, if not thrice, the level in countries such as China, South Korea, Singapore, Malaysia, and Thailand.The scheme will come with a specified cap with a negative list of sectors linked to parameters, such as low value addition, raw material or primary products, and items where there is a high probability of misuse, sources told TOI. Exporters will get the benefit upfront with banks getting reimbursed.Govt is also seeking to end the hardship faced by exporters - especially MSMEs and e-commerce - due to banks demanding collaterals. The plan is to provide over 80% of the collateral requirement based on track record through an online evaluation and monitoring mechanism. Exporters will be given a unique ID with fund disbursals on a monthly or quarterly basis under the scheme where a credit guarantee fund will be roped in.The commerce department has also lined up plans to provide easier access to working capital through trade finance instruments, with post-shipment tools, such as factoring, reverse factoring, and vendor financing for small exporters. The overall benefit will come with a ceiling, sources indicated.Similarly, to support emerging opportunities, the govt intends to share up to 90% of the risk of MSMEs, which are looking to venture into ""new, high-risk markets"", with at least 1,000 exporters to be backed in the first year. The Centre intends to use the Trade Assistance Fund to invest in liquid assets allowed under EXIM Bank's investment policy, sources said.A Focused Market Access Initiative is also planned to help exporters tap new opportunities. Govt will support their participation in fairs and meet up to 90% of the cost.

The demand for gold exchange-traded funds (ETFs), however, jumped on both the exchanges on Wednesday.Earlier in April, the price of the precious metal rose above the Rs 1 lakh/10gm level, an all-time record. On Wednesday, the price in retail markets around the country hovered between Rs 94,000 and Rs 95,000.Across India, jewellers designed schemes and offers for consumers to soften the blow of steep gold prices and encourage more customers to shop. For example, Malabar Group offered up to 25% off on making charges of gold jewellery and studded jewellery. The company also had an advanced booking facility in place, which allowed customers rate protection by enabling them to book jewellery with a minimum down payment of 10% of the total value and pay the rest based on the booked rate or the prevailing market rate-whichever was lower, said chairman MP Ahammed.Some of the purchases were driven by investment-based needs and the growing desire to hedge against further price rises, he said.According to Darshan Gupta, partner at Mangatrai Jewellers in Hyderabad, the mood among gold buyers was 'lukewarm'. Gupta, who has been trying to woo customers with offers like 'no making charges', said despite all their efforts, the sentiment to buy was lacking. ""Business is expected to be at least 30% lower than last year's Akshaya Tritiya,"" he said.Although business in terms of volume was lower than last year, in terms of value it was almost similar, according to data from the India Bullion & Jewellers Association. Approximately 20 tonnes of gold worth Rs 18,000 crore was sold across the country during the day. In the Mumbai market alone, about 2.5 tonnes of gold worth about Rs 2,350 crore is estimated to have been sold.Rising gold prices also pushed consumers to opt for more pocket-friendly options. PC Chandra Jewellers, for instance, saw more customers queuing up for lightweight gold jewellery and silver. Some diamond pieces, too, found favour with customers.The demand for ETFs showed good traction on the bourses. On the NSE, ETFs worth about Rs 340 crore were traded, while on the BSE the corresponding number was nearly Rs 30 crore.",High prices of gold led to lukewarm demand for the yellow metal on Akshaya Tritiya.

NEW DELHI: The Maharashtra government has appointed senior IPS officer Deven Bharti, a 1994-batch officer, as the new Mumbai Police Commissioner .Bharti is known for handling several high-profile investigations, including the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks.Deven Bharti will formally assume charge as Mumbai's police commissioner later this evening, succeeding Vivek Phansalkar, who retires after a distinguished 35-year career in the force.Though the state home department has confirmed Bharti’s appointment, the post has been downgraded to the rank of Additional Director General of Police (ADGP), an official said.While the Mumbai Police Commissioner’s role is typically of ADGP rank, it had been temporarily upgraded to Director General (DG) level for some past appointments.Bharti, a 1994-batch IPS officer, currently serves as Mumbai’s Special Commissioner.He was considered one of the most powerful IPS officers in Mumbai during Devendra Fadnavis ’s tenure as Chief Minister between 2014 and 2019, when he held the position of Joint Commissioner (Law and Order). Following his promotion to Additional Director General, Bharti was posted as chief of the Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS).However, under the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government, he was moved to what is seen as a relatively low-profile role — Joint Managing Director of the Maharashtra State Security Corporation.On December 13, 2022, Bharti was replaced by then Joint Commissioner (Traffic) Rajvardhan. Since then, he had been awaiting a key posting, alongside other senior officers such as ATS chief Vinit Agarwal, Thane Police Commissioner Bipin Kumar Singh, and ACB Additional DG Prabhat Kumar.A reshuffle in top IPS positions had been expected ever since Fadnavis assumed charge of the home department last year. Sources said there was a proposal to bring IPS officer Rashmi Shukla back as Mumbai Police Commissioner or to appoint her as Director General, Anti-Corruption — a post vacant since Rajneesh Seth was elevated to DGP in December. Bharti was also in consideration for the post of Special Commissioner.However, Shukla’s potential return was stalled after a Pune court rejected the police’s application to close the phone-tapping case against her. With that plan shelved, the government cleared the way for Bharti’s elevation to Mumbai’s top police post.","Deven Bharti, a 1994-batch IPS officer, currently serves as Mumbai’s Special Commissioner.

How is China planning to cushion domestic firms from US tariff blow?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/how-is-china-planning-to-cushion-domestic-firms-from-us-tariff-blow/articleshow/120773023.cms,"In a quiet but strategic move, China has begun informing companies of a new list of US-made products that will be exempted from its punishing 125% tariffs, according to two people familiar with the development. The move will cushion Chinese companies that rely on American products, saving them from the tariff impact.The unpublished list, called a ‘whitelist’, has not been publicly disclosed, as Chinese authorities sought to limit the damage from retaliatory tariffs that have hit critical imports. Sources told Reuters that companies have been asked to identify essential US goods, such as pharmaceuticals, microchips and aircraft engines, for which tariff waivers could be considered.According to a source at a pharmaceutical company selling American-made drugs in China, officials from the Shanghai Pudong government contacted the firm on Monday with news of a product classification list exempt from tariffs. The source, whose firm had lobbied for relief due to its reliance on US technology, said, “We still have many technologies we need from the US”Another source went on to reveal that some companies have been encouraged to proactively contact the government to see whether their imported products qualify for exemption.The exemption list appears to be expanding. On Tuesday, the Asian giant had waived tariffs on ethane imports from the US, following lobbying by major processors who depend solely on American supplies.While Beijing has remained officially silent, with no response yet to come from China’s commerce and customs ministries — the behind-the-scenes activity is being interpreted as a sign of flexibility amid ongoing trade tensions.The policy shift followed a renewed escalation in the tariff battle. Earlier, US President Donald Trump brushed off concerns about the economic impact of steep tariffs, telling ABC News, “China probably will eat those tariffs ... They were ripping us off like nobody's ever ripped us off … They're not doing that anymore.”However, signs of strain are already showing as Chinese manufacturing activity declined in April, reversing modest gains made in March. The slowdown coincided with the latest round of US tariffs and rising uncertainty for exporters.Beijing on Tuesday lashed out at Washington’s trade tactics, accusing the US of “bullying,” “deception,” and engaging in “economic coercion.”Meanwhile, Chinese authorities are trying to have an idea of the broader impact of the tariff war on domestic and foreign firms. In one case, a foreign business lobby group was asked by officials in eastern China to report “critical situations” stemming from the tariffs so individual cases could be taken into consideration.","China has begun informing companies of a new list of US-made products that will be exempted from its punishing 125% tariffs.

The downturn, which caught markets off guard, was fuelled by a jump in imports, slowing consumer spending, and weaker government expenditure.“The downturn in real GDP in the first quarter reflected an upturn in imports, a deceleration in consumer spending, and a downturn in government spending,” the commerce department reported. Consumer spending alone slumped to a 1.8% annual pace, down from 4% in the previous quarter, highlighting the toll that economic uncertainty is taking on households.The contraction has deepened concerns about the health of the US economy, with all three major Wall Street indices falling sharply in early trading. While Federal Reserve policymakers have so far brushed off the GDP decline, financial markets are now betting that the central bank will be compelled to act by June, should further signs of economic weakness emerge.Earlier, Fed Chair Jerome Powell had said that the central bank would hold steady on interest rates while it waited for “greater clarity” on the economic impact of President Trump’s policies.Trump’s tariff policies present a challenge for the Federal Reserve as it works to maintain price stability and full employment, and tackling the widespread discouragement due to the fall in GDP.","US economy contracted at an annual rate of 0.3% in the first quarter of 2025.

Amidst the ongoing India-Pakistan tensions , Pakistan is wooing a cryptocurrency firm predominantly controlled by US President Donald Trump's family. World Liberty Financial , a decentralised finance (DeFi) platform with 60% Trump family ownership, has entered into preliminary agreements with Pakistan Crypto Council to enhance blockchain technology implementation in India's neighbouring nation, according to an ET report.This development occurred merely five days after a terrorist incident in Pahalgam claimed 26 tourist lives, leading to heightened tensions between India and Pakistan, nearly resulting in military confrontation. India has identified two of the three attackers as Pakistani nationals, though Pakistan has rejected these claims.According to Dawn newspaper, the World Liberty delegation, comprising Zachary Folkman, Chase Herro and Zachary Witkoff, held meetings with Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and army chief General Asim Munir.The newspaper reported that World Liberty Financial formalised a ""Letter of Intent with Pakistan Crypto Council to accelerate blockchain innovation, stablecoin adoption and decentralised finance integration across Pakistan.""A Trump-linked organisation, DT Marks DEFI LLC , maintains a significant 60% ownership stake in WLF Holdco LLC, World Liberty's parent company.

This initiative would likely receive Trump's endorsement, particularly as nations including Switzerland, Australia and South Korea have declined to establish a cryptocurrency national reserve.Chainalysis data from 2024 indicates Pakistan ranked ninth in cryptocurrency adoption, recording 25 million active users and $300 billion in yearly transactions.

""We've seen this mistake before.

Asia stocks up ahead of earnings barrage, economic data on impact of Trump tariffs | ANC

Asian markets moved in different directions on Wednesday with countries like Japan and Taiwan registering small gains, following a strong performance on Wall Street the previous day. However, ongoing concerns about US trade policy under president Donald Trump continued to make investors worried.Associated Press reported that in Tokyo, Japan’s main stock index Nikkei rose slightly, but shares of car companies dipped after Trump signed an order that rolled back some tariffs on car parts. Hong Kong and South Korea saw declines, while Taiwan and Australia showed small gains.In the US, the main stock indexes continued their upward streak. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq both rose, helped by strong earnings reports from major companies. Honeywell International saw its stock jump over 5% after it reported higher-than-expected profits and raised its forecast for the year. Paint maker Sherwin-Williams also posted solid gains.UPS, the world’s largest package delivery company, reported better profits than analysts expected. However, it also announced plans to cut 20,000 jobs and close 73 buildings due to economic uncertainty, which pushed its shares slightly lower.Many CEOs are unsure how long profits can hold up amid Trump’s unpredictable tariff policies. There’s growing concern that tariffs could slow down global trade and make goods more expensive. A recent report showed US consumer confidence has fallen sharply—now at its lowest since 2011. That’s usually a warning sign for recession. Even Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent acknowledged the tension, calling the economic confusion a “strategic” part of Trump’s negotiation tactics.","Asian markets moved in different directions on Wednesday with countries like Japan and Taiwan registering small gains, following a strong performance on Wall Street the previous day.

China Urges Nations to Resist ‘Bully’ Trump | Bloomberg: The China Show 4/29/2025

China’s manufacturing activity declined in April after showing signs of recovery in March, according to government data released on Wednesday. The slump comes amid rising trade tensions with the United States, which recently imposed heavy tariffs on Chinese goods.The Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) — an important indicator of factory activity — dropped to 49 in April, down from 50.5 in March, which had been the highest reading in 12 months. The April figure was also lower than the 49.7 expected by a Bloomberg survey.According to China’s National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), the drop was linked to both a strong performance the previous month and increased trade pressure. “In April, affected by factors such as a high base from earlier rapid manufacturing growth and a sharp shift in the external environment, the manufacturing PMI fell,” said NBS statistician Zhao Qinghe, as quoted by AFP.This fall in manufacturing comes just weeks after the United States imposed tariffs of up to 145% on many Chinese products. Beijing responded with 125% tariffs on several US imports.Although Chinese exports had jumped by over 12% in March as firms rushed to ship goods before the new tariffs kicked in, domestic issues remain. The country is still recovering from the Covid-19 pandemic, struggling with low consumer demand and a long-running property sector crisis.To address these challenges, Chinese authorities have introduced stimulus measures, including rate cuts and relaxed home-buying rules. They’ve also set a goal to create 12 million new urban jobs this year and maintain 5% economic growth, matching last year’s target.","The Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) — an important indicator of factory activity — dropped to 49 in April, down from 50.5 in March.

JP Morgan CEO: Best case scenario for US economy is a recession

First-quarter US GDP figures to be released on Wednesday are expected to reveal a sharp slowdown — and possibly signal a recession — due to a spike in imports rushed in before president Donald Trump's broad tariffs took effect.Since returning to office on January 20, president Trump announced several rounds of tariffs and a universal 10% base tariff on all imports from top trading partners, along with a steep 125% tariff specifically on Chinese goods.After April’s market turmoil, the Trump administration paused higher tariffs for 90 days to allow trade talks, but kept a 10% base rate for most nations and imposed new China-specific tariffs totalling 145%.The tariff announcement triggered a market selloff, driving volatility to its highest levels since the Covid-19 pandemic and unsettling investors.Analysts had predicted that the economy would grow by about 2% in 2025, but since Trump returned to office and introduced new tariffs, many have lowered their forecasts including Wall Street titans Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley.Some even expect the economy to shrink in the first quarter. Even if it doesn’t shrink, growth is expected to slow down significantly—just 0.4% in the first quarter, compared to 2.4% in the last quarter of 2024, according to Briefing.com.","First-quarter US GDP figures to be released on Wednesday are expected to reveal a sharp slowdown — and possibly signal a recession.

The US administration announced plans to implement measures by Tuesday to reduce the impact of automotive import tariffs , allowing manufacturers additional time to shift production to US soil.While the 25 per cent tariffs on imported vehicles and components will continue, they will be restructured to prevent overlap with other tariffs, including those on steel and aluminium, according to a White House representative, quoted by the New york Times. Vehicle manufacturers will be exempt from paying multiple tariffs on these essential materials.Manufacturers will receive partial compensation for tariffs paid on imported components. The reimbursement scheme will provide up to 3.75 per cent of a new vehicle's value in the first year, gradually decreasing over two years, as confirmed by the spokesperson.The automotive industry responded positively to these changes. ""We believe the president's leadership is helping level the playing field for companies like GM and allowing us to invest even more in the US economy,"" Mary T Barra, CEO of General Motors, said in a statement Monday. ""We appreciate the productive conversations with the president and his administration and look forward to continuing to work together. ""The 25 per cent vehicle import tariff became effective April 3, with an expansion to include parts scheduled for Saturday.""President Trump is building an important partnership with both the domestic automakers and our great American workers,"" Howard Lutnick, the commerce secretary, said in a statement. ""This deal is a major victory for the president's trade policy by rewarding companies who manufacture domestically, while providing runway to manufacturers who have expressed their commitment to invest in America and expand their domestic manufacturing,"" he further added.At Tuesday morning's news conference, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt announced Trump's intention to sign an auto tariff-related executive order. Additionally, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, while avoiding specific details about tariff relief, emphasised the policy's focus on encouraging domestic production.However, despite the adjustments, significant tariffs will remain on imported vehicles and components, resulting in substantial price increases for new and used vehicles, alongside higher repair and insurance costs.","The US administration announced plans to reduce the impact of automotive import tariffs.

Under the proposed policy shift, a 26 per cent reciprocal tariff is scheduled to come into effect on 8 July unless a new deal is struck.The latest remarks hint that India could be the first to secure a bilateral pact with Washington that aligns with Trump’s trade vision, making it a key player in reshaping US economic partnerships.The talks come amid broader American efforts to deepen strategic and economic ties with India. Earlier during his visit to India US vice president JD Vance, had urged to eliminate remaining non-tariff barriers and boost imports of American energy and defence goods.According to US Census Bureau data, India accounted for nearly 3 per cent of all American imports as of February. The US trade deficit with India stood at $45.7 billion in 2024, highlighting the scale and importance of the bilateral economic relationship.Bessent also confirmed that discussions are ongoing with Japan and South Korea. He noted that South Korea’s upcoming presidential election in June is unlikely to hinder progress on a separate deal with Seoul.","U.S. treasury secretary Scott Bessent said that the two countries are ""very close"" to a breakthrough.

But calm before an even fiercer storm.”It accused the US of deliberately targeting China by forcing other countries to limit trade with China, playing a “90-day pause game.”However, China reaffirmed its firm opposition to the US, warning that yielding to American tariffs would be “like drinking poison to quench thirst.” To defend its stance, Beijing pointed to past instances where countries like Japan and France faced US accusations that ultimately undermined their national industries.“History has proven that compromise won't earn you mercy — kneeling only invites more bullying.”It said, “China won't kneel down because we know standing up for ourselves keeps the possibility of cooperation alive while compromise snuffs it out.”The ministry further asserted that China won't back down, “so the voices of the weak will be heard.”China also urged other nations to unite in pushing back against the US, asserting that America does not speak for the world and that its share of global production and trade accounts for less than one-fifth.“We have the power to push back when the choice of the world stands together in solidarity.”Taking another jibe at Washington, it said that “the US is just a small stranded boat. Imperialists are always arrogant. If they show a bit of reason, it's only because they're forced to do so.”The statement closed with a firm message, warning that the United States will continue to “flip flopping and playing hardball” in its approach to global trade, but insisting that China will not waver.“No matter how hard the wind blows, no matter how clouds rage, the darker the night, the brighter the stars shine,” it declared.China further called for action, saying that “someone has to step forward, torch in hand to shatter the fog and illuminate the path ahead.” It called on all nations to stand tall and united, arguing that only through collective strength can the world break free from the grip of hegemony.“When every nation stands tall, the world will break through the walls of hegemony. For China, for the world, we must rise and fight on,” the message stated.China had earlier warned, opposing any country securing a deal with the United States at the expense of Chinese interests and vowed to take ""countermeasures"" if interests are compromised.This strong message comes amid rising diplomatic friction, with Beijing flatly denying claims by Donald Trump that Chinese President Xi Jinping had recently called him to discuss the worsening trade dispute. The Chinese foreign Ministry said “no such call” had taken place, contradicting Trump’s assertions to Time magazine and at a White House press briefing.“As far as I know, there has been no phone call between the two heads of state recently,” said foreign ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun on Monday. “China and the United States are not conducting consultations or negotiations on tariff issues.”Trump’s tariffs, now as high as 145% on Chinese goods, are rattling markets and hitting American consumers and manufacturers alike. But China, for now, appears unfazed in its stance.","The Chinese ministry of foreign affairs compared the US to a storm, warning allies that bowing to US pressure was similar to “drinking poison to quench thirst” It accused the US of deliberately targeting China by forcing other countries to limit trade with China, playing a “90-day pause game”","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120738430,imgsize-435722,width-400,resizemode-4/120738430.jpg"

American consumer confidence in the economy has dropped to its lowest level since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic. The Conference Board reported a sharp 7.9-point decline in April, bringing the index down to 86, marking the lowest reading since May 2020.The decline is being largely attributed to growing concern over tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump ’s administration, which have included a 10 per cent levy on most imports and a steep 145 per cent tariff on Chinese goods, along with duties on steel, aluminium and automobiles.Nearly one-third of consumers now expect a slowdown in employment—levels not seen since April 2009 during the Great Recession. An Associated Press-NORC Center survey also found that around half of Americans are worried about a potential recession.""Rattled consumers spend less than confident consumers,"" said Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics. ""If confidence sags and consumers retrench, growth will go down.""The index measuring short-term expectations for income, business conditions and employment dropped 12.5 points to 54.4—its lowest in over 13 years and far below the threshold of 80, which often signals a looming recession.The largest drops in confidence were seen among Americans aged 35 to 55 and those earning more than $125,000 annually.Also read: US job openings drop to 7.2 million in March amid tariff-driven uncertainty Market volatility has contributed to the downturn in sentiment, with the S&P 500 down 6 per cent for the year, the Dow Jones falling 5 per cent, and the Nasdaq declining by 10 per cent in 2025 despite recent recoveries.Spending intentions have weakened across the board. Fewer Americans are planning to purchase homes or cars, amid high mortgage rates and property prices. Overseas vacation planning has dropped from 24.1 per cent in December to 16.4 per cent in April. Restaurant spending plans also saw a historic decline.The US government is set to release its report on first-quarter economic growth on Wednesday, with economists projecting a notable slowdown following a robust holiday spending season. Meanwhile, Friday’s Labor Department report is expected to reflect continued job growth , although some analysts anticipate a marked dip in hiring.Consumer expectations of a downturn within the next 12 months have reached a two-year high.","American consumer confidence in the economy has dropped to its lowest level since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic.

US job openings drop to 7.2 million in March amid tariff-driven uncertainty,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/international-business/us-job-openings-drop-to-7-2-million-in-march-amid-tariff-driven-uncertainty/articleshow/120735464.cms,"AI-generated image (Credit: Bing image creator)

Job openings in the United States declined in March, reflecting growing economic uncertainty tied to President Trump’s trade policies. Trump had announced implementation of import tariffs in march to be effective from April but just days later, announced a 90-day pause on all countries except China.According to Tuesday’s report from the US Labor Department, employers advertised 7.2 million positions in March — down from 7.5 million in February and 8.1 million in March 2024. The figure fell short of economists’ expectations of 7.5 million and marked the lowest level since September.The Job Openings and Labor Turnover Summary (JOLTS) report also noted a slight uptick in voluntary resignations, a sign that workers remain confident in the labor market. Redundancies fell to their lowest point since June, further suggesting resilience in hiring.While job vacancies remain historically elevated, they have steadily declined from a peak of 12.1 million in March 2022, during the post-pandemic recovery.Despite elevated interest rates from the Federal Reserve aimed at curbing inflation, the labor market has shown notable durability. Both private and public sector organizations have continued to recruit workers.However, economic prospects remain uncertain, shaped by presidential policies such as high import tariffs, reductions in federal employment, and crackdown on immigration.Notably, the recently implemented federal employment cuts under Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency had minimal impact in March. Federal dismissals fell to 8,000 — down from 19,000 in February, which was the highest since November 2020.“The job market is continuing to hold its own, but barely,” said Robert Frick, an economist at Navy Federal Credit Union, in comments to the Associated Press. “While job openings dropped below forecasts, they haven’t reached a post-Covid low,” he added.Frick warned that the apparent stability may be temporary: “Hiring holds steady and layoffs dipped a bit, showing that, overall, employers are clinging to the employees they have. But this is likely the calm before the storm, as layoffs are pending in government contractors, manufacturers, and other sectors impacted by government layoffs and tariffs.”","US employers advertised 7.2 million positions in March, down from 7.5 million in February and 8.1 million in March 2024.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor ( CEA ) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country. CEA said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-105332515,imgsize-39018,width-400,resizemode-4/105332515.jpg"
E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran Udaan until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.Udaan built an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business still accounts for a very small part of India’s overall retail market but can balloon to $150 billion in sales and yield a 100% return on capital invested in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co. estimates published in the Mint newspaper.Bengaluru-based Udaan has also ventured into financing through its fintech unit which helps shopkeepers get working capital loans to buy inventory. That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says.

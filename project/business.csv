Switzerland revokes MFN status to India over SC Nestle order,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/switzerland-revokes-mfn-status-to-india-over-sc-nestle-order/articleshow/116303992.cms,"(Reuters photo)

More nations may follow Switzerland, say experts

NEW DELHI: Retaliating against a 2023 Supreme Court ruling related to Nestle, Switzerland has withdrawn the most-favoured-nation clause to India under the double tax avoidance agreement, a move that will hit Indian companies invested in the European nation.""For dividends due from and including Jan 1, 2025, the residual tax rate in the source State is limited to 10%,"" the Swiss federal department of finance said in a statement issued Wednesday. Earlier they had to pay 5% tax.India and Switzerland had originally signed the agreement in 1994 and the protocols were amended in 2000 and 2010. Subsequently, India signed tax treaties with Colombia and Lithuania that provided tax rates on certain types of income that were lower than the rates it provided to OECD member nations. Three years ago, Switzerland interpreted that Colombia and Lithuania joining the OECD meant a 5% rate for dividends would apply under the DTAA to India, too, under the MFN clause.Supreme Court last year ruled that the MFN clause doesn't automatically trigger when a country joins the OECD if the Indian govt signed a tax treaty with that country before it joined the organisation.""On the basis of the Indian SC ruling, the Swiss competent authority acknowledges that its interpretation of para 5 of the protocol to the IN-CH (India-Switzerland) DTA is not shared by the Indian side. In the absence of reciprocity, it therefore waives its unilateral application with effect from 1 January 2025,"" the Swiss govt said on WednesdayIndian companies face a higher liability due to the decision. ""With the reversion to a 10% residual rate starting Jan 1, 2025, these firms face higher tax liabilities, reducing their competitiveness compared to businesses from countries still benefiting from MFN provisions,"" said Ajay Srivastava of GTRI.Experts also said that more countries could follow suit. ""Essentially, Switzerland is of the view that it is not receiving the same treatment that India grants to other countries with more favourable tax treaties. Further, the main reason behind this is of reciprocity, which ensures that taxpayers in both countries are treated equally and fairly. This seems to have been disregarded after the said ruling since Swiss authorities announced in Aug 2021 that based on the most-favoured-nation clause between Switzerland and India, the tax rate on dividends from qualifying shareholdings would be reduced from 10% to 5%, effective retroactively from July 5, 2018. However, the subsequent ruling in 2023 contradicted the same,"" said Amit Maheshwari, tax partner, AKM Global.",Switzerland has withdrawn the most-favoured-nation clause to India under the double tax avoidance agreement.

Gold rally may slow down in 2025: WGC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/gold-rally-may-slow-down-in-2025-wgc/articleshow/116303894.cms,"Representative image

Gold prices are set to rise more slowly in 2025 after a record-breaking run this year, according to the World Gold Council .Bullion is up more than 30% so far in 2024, but gains next year will likely be tempered by variables like growth and inflation, the WGC said. Possible trade wars in US President-elect Donald Trump's second term and complicated interest-rate outlooks may spill over into subpar economic growth, hurting demand from investors and consumers, the industry association said in its 2025 outlook report released on Thursday.""All eyes are on the US. Trump's second term may provide a boost to the local economy but could equally elicit a fair degree of nervousness for investors around the world, it said.Bullion's rally in the early part of 2024 was driven by large purchases by central banks, especially the People's Bank of China and others in emerging markets. It got a further boost from the Federal Reserve's recent monetary easing and haven demand during periods of heightened geopolitical tensions including wars in West Asia and Ukraine. However, gains have stalled due to a rally in the dollar following Trump's election win.Some banks are still bullish on the prospects of the precious metal, currently trading near $2,700 an ounce, next year. Goldman Sachs Group is forecasting it will get to $3,000 by the end of 2025, while UBS AG sees $2,900.China's actions in the gold market will be closely watched. So far, investors there have provided price support, while consumers have stayed on the sidelines, but ""these dynamics hang on the direct (and indirect) effects of trade, stimulus and perceptions of risk,"" the WGC said.The yellow metal will rise if the world sees ""significantly lower interest rates, or a deterioration in geopolitics or financial market conditions,"" the council said. Lower rates typically benefit gold as it pays no interest.","Bullion is up more than 30% so far in 2024, but gains next year will likely be tempered by variables like growth and inflation.

The creditor banks had initiated corporate resolution under Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, and JSW was the applicant seeking assets for an amount of about Rs 19,350 crore, as against the outstanding loans of Rs 47,204 crore.Through an affidavit filed before Supreme Court, ED urged the apex court that it may direct handing over the attached assets to JSW and consider the same as restitution under PMLA.

‘India can grow even faster with less inequality’: Economist Thomas Piketty,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/india-can-grow-even-faster-with-less-inequality-economist-thomas-piketty/articleshow/116310271.cms,"Economist

Thomas Piketty

is known for his work on inequality. In India, to speak at the

Delhi School of Economics

and think tank

RIS

, he makes the case for the govt to levy 2% tax on the wealth of the ultra-rich and expand the tax base as the country has the highest level of inequality, next only to South Africa. Excerpts from an interview with TOI’s Sidhartha & Surojit Gupta:

Your studies suggest that inequality has increased post-1991 in India. But there seems to be a much bigger middle class, poverty is not as stark as it was 35 years ago. While the gap between the top 1% and bottom 10% has increased, aren’t more people better off?

Thomas Piketty:

You’ve talked about tackling inequality by taxing the super-rich. But it’s a very difficult process in countries like India. What other measures can be taken and how do you convince the wealthy to give more?

In India, the top rate of income tax works out to some 43%. Where do we go from here? Besides, a lot of the rich are non-residents who do not pay taxes here. How do you address that?

India has done a lot on financial inclusion in recent years. Is this another way of trying to attack inequality?

Will something like universal basic income work in a country like India?

Will a wider public holding of these family-owned businesses reduce concentration of wealth?

You’re not a believer of the trickle-down theory?

My general point is that India could do even better with less inequality. I’m not saying that everything is going wrong in India. India is making progress to reduce poverty. My point is that we don’t need this kind of extreme inequality level that we find in India. In fact, we could grow even faster, reduce poverty even more with less inequality. The level of inequality we see in India in terms of share going to the bottom 50%, share going to the top 10%, and share going to top 1% puts India almost at the very top of the scale of the world. We have a few countries like South Africa, which do even worse. Whether I look at today’s rich countries, the European countries or even the US, which is more unequal than Europe, is less unequal than India and has become less unequal at quite early stages of development through public policies, through progressive taxation.Fifty years ago, China was not richer than India. It has become richer than India. A part of the reason why it has become richer than India is that it has been somewhat less unequal, at least in socio-economic terms; in political terms, that’s another story, of course.■ Taxation is always complicated because everybody would like to pay less tax. But the level of tax revenue in India is 13-14% of GDP, which is not very large. If you want to fund the police force, the justice system, infrastructure, education, everything with 13-14% of GDP, what you end up doing is that you’re not paying the people very well, you’re not funding anything very well, and you don’t get the quality of public services.You have less than 10% of the population paying the income tax in India. You have to say as incomes go up and as you have large real growth of income each year, this percentage should increase a little bit. Forty years ago, 10% of the population was paying income tax in China, now it’s 70-80% of the population. So, you get more tax revenue. And if you want this to be acceptable for the middle class and the upper middle class, then of course you need to start with the very top.If they have the feeling that people at the very top can evade taxes and we have a kind of crony capitalism with top billionaires completely evading taxes, it’s difficult to do it. The Indian govt could also do things in India for greater tax justice, it can be a more powerful voice in international discussion about billionaire taxation. Brazil played the role in the G20 summit to push for the Global South. But why was India passive? I want India to push for ambitious redistribution including taxing the Indian billionaires.■ For the 43% tax rate what matters is to make it effective for people at the very top. If you look at top billionaires, the income they will report in their income tax return is going to be like 0.01% of the wealth; you can tax it at 90% if you want, but this is irrelevant.The issue is to tax the wealthy. What we have computed in our work is that just a 2% wealth tax on India’s super rich (167 billionaires) will raise very significant revenue (0.5% of the national income) when you compare it to the education budget, health budget. These people can live anywhere but they have made their fortunes in India, using Indian infrastructure, using the Indian education system, using the Indian legal system, sometimes using connections with govt.At some point, the govt of India is perfectly legitimate to say, for instance, if you want to live somewhere else and you have spent the first 50 years of your life in India where you accumulated your wealth, you will still pay in proportion to the number of years you spent in India. If you start with the assumption that the very wealthy can get away, how do you want to convince the rest of the population to pay more tax? The govt of India has the capability to make its decision respected. It’s a matter of political will.■ It can be useful, but it’s not enough. Access to credit is important, but you also want good quality basic public services, infrastructure, education, health.■ It can be useful, but it’s not the magic bullet. That’s not going to replace high quality public services. That’s not going to replace access to credit. But this is all part of the solution.■ In some cases it can make sense. I also believe in more worker involvement in these companies.

In India, he makes the case for the govt to levy 2% tax on the wealth of the ultra-rich and expand the tax base.

The other reason for the month's slowdown in numbers could be because of the change in dates of the festive season each year,” Gera said.He further added that it would take some months to comment on whether it is an aberration or a trend.InfraMantra Director and co-founder Garvit Tiwari also commented on the decline, ""The drop in property registration in Pune in November is not symptomatic of any weakness in the market"".He stated that the market continues to exhibit strong demand from property seekers, and any decline may be due to the high base effect.

MUMBAI: Through its AI initiative - FinAI , a key pillar of Bajaj Finance 3.0 - the company aims to triple lead conversion rates , double back-office productivity, and boost front-line performance by 1.5 times.The company's AI-driven transformation will integrate with its existing cloud and digital infrastructure, said Rajeev Jain, managing director of Bajaj Finance. ""We've always been early adopters of technology,"" he said, adding, ""Technology drives revenue growth, reduces costs, and mitigates operational risks. AI will take this a step further by improving customer engagement, lowering operating expenses, and augmenting profitability.""Over the past year, the company has tested over 30 AI use cases to validate its effectiveness. ""Ninety percent of our computers operate on Microsoft Azure, and our data lake supports hundreds of thousands of variables,"" he said. ""These foundations make AI a logical next step.""One significant use case for AI at Bajaj Finance is conversational AI. Jain explained, ""Currently, SMS communication is static. With AI, messages will include interactive links. For instance, if a customer clicks a link, they can specify preferences like a smartphone instead of a smart TV. AI will then provide options, specifications, and prices, even connecting them to a dealer...

""Unsecured loans have grown rapidly after Covid, prompting necessary regulatory measures. For us, our product mix has remained consistent over the past decade,"" he said. He added that recent credit cost increases are a return to pre-Covid norms.

Wines now mainstream in India: Moet Hennessy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/wines-now-mainstream-in-india-moet-hennessy/articleshow/116302954.cms,"(Agencies photo)

NEW DELHI: Primarily whisky drinkers, Indians are now increasingly taking to wines and other spirits too. The market here is seeing a shift towards premiumisation, which Moet Hennessy India - a part of the world's largest luxury group Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessy - views as a big opportunity to grow here. And once in-the-works free trade agreements (FTAs) are signed with the UK and more countries, the duty structure on foreign liquor will make it more affordable in India, giving demand a further fillip, Ipsita Das, Moet Hennessy India MD, told TOI.""Indians used to drink straight ups earlier whiskey on the rocks, or just a gin and tonic. Now the format of consumption is changing here. Wines and spirits have become very mainstream today. The story of premiumisation is here to stay."" That is an ""advantage for us as Moet Hennessy is the only pure play luxury player in this segment, and premiumisation has given us a boost in the last three years. On a smaller scale, we've also seen tequilas gain popularity,"" she added.However, steep pricing due to high taxes in India remains an issue for foreign liquor companies. ""Wines and spirits in India is a very complex topic. It is a state subject and doesn't come under GST. Every state has its own regulations and policies which keep changing. That clearly adds to the lack of ease of doing business in this segment,"" she added.""When it comes to duty, India levies a 150% custom duty which is one of the highest in the world. Then there are state taxes, which also differ from state to state. With all this taxation, there's very little parity which makes it difficult for the consumers because they buy a bottle of Moet & Chandon in Europe for 45 euros. But the same costs 100 euros in India, plus or minus 10%, depending on which state you are drinking it in,"" she said. With the Indian consumer being very well-travelled now, it is not easy for companies to ""set expectations"" despite the fact that the former knows the same is due to duty and taxes here.""There have been some very active FTA conversations going on, such as with the UK. We really hope that an FTA will be able to give some relaxation in India over time, which could really boost consumption."" Das said.Like Indian whisky, made-in-India wines are also becoming increasingly popular. Moet Hennessy India makes both still and sparkling wines here under the name of Chandon. How are they doing? ""Our Indian wines are doing very well,"" Das said.","The market here is seeing a shift towards premiumisation, says Moet Hennessy India.

World Bank goals

The World Bank has withdrawn a budget support loan of more than $500 million to Pakistan as a result of the country failing to fulfil critical conditions within the time limit. The required conditions included revising the purchase power agreement in relation to the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor , according to The Express Tribune.The Washington-based international lender also declared that it would not be sanctioning any new budget supporting loans to the country during the current fiscal year which has sent a shock to the Pakistani economy as the country has almost exhausted its loan quota.""No budget support is planned for the current fiscal year, which ends in June 2025,"" the World Bank spokesperson stated.For this fiscal year, the IMF has identified a $2.5 billion external financing gap that needs to be addressed through new loans.The World Bank has canceled a loan of $500 to $600 million meant for Pakistan under the Affordable and Clean Energy Program (PACE-II), government sources revealed. Initially set at $500 million, the loan amount was later raised to $600 million to help address Pakistan's external financing gap, quoted news agency ANI.The PACE program was approved by the World Bank in June 2021, with the first tranche of USD 400 million already released. The second installment depended on meeting several conditions, such as holding talks with all Independent Power Producers (IPPs), especially the Chinese power plants built under CPEC. It was discovered that no progress had been made in renegotiating agreements with CPEC-related power plants as China has consistently refused to revisit these deals or restructure the energy debt, which amounts to approximately $16 billion.To reduce electricity costs, the government is renegotiating energy agreements with power plants set up under the 1994 and 2002 policies. The Chinese-owned power plants, along with several government-run plants, including four LNG-based and two nuclear plants, fall under the 2015 energy policy. Though the government has tried negotiating over 22 energy contracts yet, no significant reductions have been made in electricity prices which linger from 65 Pakistani Rupees (PKR) to 70 PKR.A spokesperson for the World Bank confirmed that ""slower-than-expected progress led to a shift in strategy in our support for reform"" in Pakistan's energy sector. The spokesperson further elaborated that the lender has been supporting power sector reforms through the PACE initiative.Even though slower progress led the World Bank to revise its lending strategy, the World Bank has continued its support by directly financing low-cost hydropower projects, including an additional $1 billion for the Dasu Hydropower project.Furthermore, the Bank has also continued working with all stakeholders to expedite the implementation of the Electricity Distribution Efficiency Improvement Project, aimed at improving efficiency in the power distribution sector. It has also offered technical assistance to promote private sector involvement in power distribution companies (DISCOs).For the ongoing fiscal year, Pakistan anticipated $2 billion in loans from the World Bank.However, by the end of the July-October period, only $349 million, 18 per cent of the planned amount, had been disbursed.Under the PACE-II program, Pakistan was expected to tackle inefficiencies in power distribution companies and reduce the growth of circular debt. However, the government has been unable to achieve either of these objectives. The government had approved a roadmap under PACE-I to encourage private sector involvement in the distribution sector, but it remained far from implementation.The National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA) recently reported that inefficiencies in power distribution companies led to losses of PKR 660 billion in the last fiscal year. During the same period, circular debt surged to PKR 2.393 trillion, far exceeding the targets set in agreements with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank.The successful implementation of this roadmap was essential for evaluating the progress of the power sector reform program, but it was not carried out.",The World Bank has withdrawn a budget support loan of more than $500 million to Pakistan as a result of the country failing to fulfil critical conditions.

Both countries subsequently joined the OECD.In 2021, Switzerland interpreted that when Colombia and Lithuania joined the OECD, a 5 per cent dividend rate would apply to the India-Switzerland tax treaty under the MFN clause, instead of the agreement's stated 10 per cent.Following the MFN status suspension, from January 1, 2025, Switzerland will impose a 10 per cent tax on dividends for Indian tax residents seeking Swiss withholding tax refunds and Swiss tax residents claiming foreign tax credits.The Swiss finance department officially announced the suspension of the MFN clause protocol between Switzerland and India regarding double taxation avoidance on income taxes.The Swiss authorities cited a 2023 Indian Supreme Court ruling in a case involving Vevey-based Nestle as the basis for withdrawing the MFN status.This decision means Swiss authorities will levy a 10 per cent tax on dividends earned by Indian entities in Switzerland from January 1, 2025.The statement notes that whilst the Delhi High Court supported the applicability of residual tax rates considering the MFN clause in 2021, the Indian Supreme Court reversed this on October 19, 2023, concluding that the MFN clause was not directly applicable without proper notification under Section 90 of the Income Tax Act.Nangia Andersen M&A Tax Partner Sandeep Jhunjhunwala commented that this unilateral suspension represents a significant change in bilateral treaty dynamics.He added that Indian entities in Switzerland may face increased tax obligations, highlighting the challenges of managing international tax treaties in today's global context.Jhunjhunwala emphasised the importance of treaty partners agreeing on interpretation and application of tax treaty clauses for predictability and stability.AKM Global Tax Partner, Amit Maheshwari, explained that reciprocity drove the MFN withdrawal decision, aiming for equal treatment of taxpayers in both nations.Maheshwari noted that Swiss authorities had previously announced a reduction in dividend tax rates from 10 to 5 per cent, retroactive from July 5, 2018, but the 2023 Supreme Court ruling contradicted this position.He concluded that this could affect Swiss investments in India through higher dividend withholding, and from January 1, 2025, taxation may revert to original treaty rates, disregarding the MFN clause.JSA Advocates & Solicitors Partner Kumarmanglam Vijay indicated this would particularly affect Indian companies with ODI structures involving Swiss subsidiaries, increasing Swiss dividend withholding tax from 5 to 10 per cent from January 1, 2025.",The Swiss authorities have suspended the most favoured nation status (MFN) provision in the Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (DTAA) with India.

Catch-up: Amazon goes all in on AI,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/catch-up-amazon-goes-all-in-on-ai/articleshow/116268969.cms,"Amazon

LAS VEGAS: Amazon's cloud unit AWS unveiled new AI models and chips to take on rivals like Microsoft, which has had an edge due to its ties with ChatGPT-maker OpenAI.Exactly two years ago, the launch of ChatGPT thrust Silicon Valley into the AI age, forcing tech giants to redraw plans and wiping out billions from market caps of companies that were slow to adapt. AWS, which pioneered renting out data infrastructure, was seen to be losing grip on its cloud dominance over the past two years amid the AI boom.However, Andy Jassy, who built AWS before succeeding Jeff Bezos as Amazon CEO in 2021, sees it differently. ""When we talk about AI, it is typically less to announce that we have beat the best chess player in the world... We are not using AI because we think it is cool. We are using it because we are trying to solve customer problems,"" Jassy said at AWS's annual tech event re:Invent in Las Vegas last week. AWS has sought to embed AI into its services and push customers to bring more of their applications by offering them a wide choice of AI models and chips, including its in-house ones, through its Bedrock platform.""With the announcement of Nova, we have made it clear that we want to compete... Whether it's chips or models, we will be very competitive on costs,"" Sherry Marcus, director of applied science (GenAI) at AWS, told TOI. Nova, which launched last week, is AWS's answer to AI foundation models like Google's Gemini and OpenAI's GPT-4o. Essentially, these are machine learning models trained on vast datasets and designed to produce a range of outputs, including chatbots.AI-related capabilities dominated AWS's announcements at the cloud conference.

The Nasdaq Composite Index achieved a historic milestone on Wednesday, reaching 20,000 for the first time, driven by enthusiasm surrounding artificial intelligence and anticipated interest rate reductions that propelled technology stocks to remarkable heights.The technology-focused index has risen over 33% this year, led by major tech firms including Apple, Nvidia, Alphabet, and recently Tesla. The gains on Wednesday followed a US inflation report that strengthened expectations for a Federal Reserve rate reduction next week.The index concluded Wednesday's trading at 20,034.89, representing a 1.8% daily increase.The current rally has benefited investors focused on growth and technology sectors, whilst raising concerns about elevated valuations and the increasing influence of large-capitalisation stocks within the index.""There is clearly an aspect of a chase into year-end, where the winners ... keep winning,"" stated Cameron Dawson, chief investment officer at NewEdge Wealth. ""The question is if this momentum can persist into 2025, where stretched valuations, positioning, sentiment, and growth expectations could all present high bars to jump over to keep above-average returns going.""Following its early 2020 decline during the pandemic-induced economic standstill, the index recovered swiftly as the Federal Reserve reduced interest rates to near-zero and the US government implemented substantial fiscal stimulus measures.The index experienced a significant decline in 2022, dropping 33% amidst 40-year high inflation rates and aggressive Federal Reserve rate increases. However, despite higher rates, the anticipated recession did not materialise, and the index has surged approximately 90% since then, partly due to growing enthusiasm about AI's commercial potential.Nvidia shares , whose chips are regarded as industry-leading, have increased more than 1,100% from their October 2022 low.""The AI story still rings true and appeals to investors,"" noted Alex Morris, chief investment officer of F/m Investments. ""These are the go-go stocks.""Despite the Nasdaq's increased valuation, it remains significantly below levels seen during the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s.The index currently trades at approximately 36 times earnings, a three-year peak exceeding its long-term average of 27, according to LSEG Datastream. This remains well below the roughly 70 times P/E ratio reached in March 2000, providing some reassurance to investors comparing the two periods.Large-capitalisation stocks increasingly dominate the index, with the top 10 companies representing 59% of the Nasdaq, compared to 45% in 2020. Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia hold the largest weightings at 11.7%, 10.6%, and 10.3% respectively.Whilst their rising share prices have boosted the Nasdaq, this concentration could pose risks should large technology companies lose favour. The 2022 downturn saw significant declines in major components, with Meta and Tesla falling 64% and 65% respectively.The Nasdaq has outperformed other major US indices this year, driven by substantial gains in heavily weighted companies like Nvidia, Amazon, and Meta Platforms. Its 33% increase in 2024 surpasses the S&P 500's 27% and Dow Jones Industrial Average's 17% gains.Over the past decade, the Nasdaq has gained over 320%, compared to the S&P 500's 200% and the Dow's 150% increase.(With inputs from agencies)","The Nasdaq Composite Index reached 20,000 for the first time on Wednesday.

(AP Photo/Mary Altaffer, File)

US consumer prices continued to rise in November at a pace that is fueling concerns the progress toward taming inflation is stalling.The so-called core consumer price index — which excludes food and energy costs — increased 0.3% for a fourth straight month, Bureau of Labor Statistics figures showed Wednesday. From a year ago, it rose 3.3%.Traders continued to bet on a Federal Reserve interest-rate cut next week after the figures came in largely as expected.Follow the reaction in real time here on Bloomberg’s TOPLive blogEconomists see the core gauge as a better indicator of the underlying inflation trend than the overall CPI that includes often-volatile food and energy costs. The headline measure rose 0.3% from the prior month and 2.7% from a year before. Shelter costs accounted for nearly 40% of the overall advance.While price pressures have subsided from a peak seen during the pandemic recovery, progress has leveled off more recently. That, along with receding concerns over the labor market, helps explain why several US central bankers have argued for a more gradual pace of interest-rate cuts.The CPI report showed goods costs excluding food and energy climbed 0.3%, the most since May 2023 and fueled by higher prices for new and used vehicles as well as apparel. That category had been a large driver of disinflation over the past year and a half.Grocery prices jumped 0.5%, the biggest advance since the start of last year.Economists have paid close attention to shelter prices, the largest category within services and one of the most persistent sources of inflation in recent years. That metric advanced 0.3% in November after a 0.4% gain in the prior month. Owners’ equivalent rent as well as rent of primary residence — subsets of shelter — both edged up 0.2%, the smallest gains since 2021.Excluding housing and energy, service prices rose 0.3% for a second month, according to Bloomberg calculations. While central bankers have stressed the importance of looking at such a metric when assessing the overall inflation trajectory, they compute it based on a separate index.That measure — known as the personal consumption expenditures price index — doesn’t put as much weight on shelter as the CPI, which is one reason why it’s trending closer to the Fed’s 2% target.A government report on producer prices due Thursday will offer insights into categories that feed directly into PCE, including health-care services, airfares and portfolio management.Policymakers also pay close attention to wage growth, as it can help inform expectations for consumer spending — the main engine of the economy. A separate report Wednesday that combines the inflation figures with recent wage data showed real hourly earnings grew 1.3% from a year ago.Part of the reason why Fed officials have indicated they’re in no rush to lower borrowing costs is because they no longer believe the labor market to be a source of inflation.Looking ahead, it remains to be seen to what extent President-elect Donald Trump ’s agenda will weigh on the trajectory of inflation. While consumers’ views of the economy and their finances have improved since he sealed his return to the White House, many economists say some of his campaign promises could put additional pressure on inflation. Some businesses, for example, are considering raising prices in anticipation of higher tariffs.","Core consumer price index increased 0.3% for a fourth straight month. From a year ago, it rose 3.3%.

Is Nissan's decline inevitable? Honda merger talks could hold key to survival,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/is-nissans-decline-inevitable-honda-merger-talks-could-hold-key-to-survival/articleshow/116148355.cms,"Representative image (Picture credit: AP)

Is a Honda merger the answer?

Nissan is grappling with a severe financial crisis that could lead to bankruptcy within the next 12 to 14 months unless decisive action is taken. The company, once a leader in the automotive industry, is now in its worst position since Carlos Ghosn's dramatic efforts in 1999 to pull it from the brink of collapse.With profits plunging by 70 per cent and a recent $60 million loss, Nissan is scrambling to find a solution to its mounting troubles, reported Forbes.In an attempt to salvage its future, Nissan has outlined a major restructuring plan, targeting $3 billion in savings.This includes slashing 9,000 jobs globally and selling a significant portion of its stake in Mitsubishi Motors . The company is also cutting production by 20 per cent at key US facilities in Canton, Mississippi, and Smyrna, Tennessee, which together employ over 13,000 workers.In a rare move, CEO Makoto Uchida has taken a 50 per cent pay cut to signal the urgency of the situation.Nissan’s woes can largely be attributed to its struggle to adapt to the rapidly changing automotive landscape.The company’s electric vehicle lineup is minimal, with only two models available internationally, while cheaper Chinese EV alternatives are flooding the market. Despite these challenges, there are bright spots.In the US, the locally-built Rogue SUV remains a top performer, having sold over 189,000 units through September 2024. Similarly, the Qashqai continues to dominate in Europe.However, these successes are not enough to counteract the broader decline, as per Forbes.Nissan is now searching for a lifeline, and a potential merger with Honda could be the key to its survival. The two companies recently signed a partnership focused on electric vehicle development , and some industry experts are speculating that a merger could help combine resources to overcome current financial struggles.According to the Financial Times, while this idea remains speculative, it could provide Nissan with the strength it needs to compete in the increasingly competitive global automotive market.Reacting to the report, Nissan Motor India spokesperson said, “As a policy we do not comment on speculatory reports. Nissan remains committed to its India operations, dealers, partners, and customers. We remain on track for our plan announced earlier this year at the launches of the Nissan X-TRAIL and New Nissan Magnite.”Nissan’s future remains uncertain, and time is running out. The company must make bold decisions, such as finding a major investor or merging with Honda if it hopes to avoid the fate of bankruptcy.","Nissan has outlined a major restructuring plan, targeting $3 billion in savings.

As South Korea descends into political chaos, its equity market risks falling further behind major tech rival Taiwan, which is basking in the glory of the global artificial intelligence boom.A near 30% surge in Taiwan’s stock benchmark this year, set to be the best since 2009, has already helped spur a historic divergence between Asia’s two tech-dominated markets. The island’s market capitalization now exceeds South Korea’s by about $950 billion as the world’s AI frontrunners from Nvidia Corp. and Microsoft Corp. to OpenAI all increasingly turn to Taiwanese firms for supply.Looking ahead to next year, while both export-oriented economies face the risk of higher tariffs by incoming US President Donald Trump, many investors see Taiwan as less vulnerable given the reliance of American firms on its technology as well as its relatively better economic prospects.Such optimism, and a recent pickup in inflows into local stocks, also augur well for the Taiwanese dollar, which has fared better than the Korean won in 2024.“The structural theme of AI is likely to only get extended further, and this means we could see another year of Taiwan outperformance,” said Charu Chanana, chief investment strategist at Saxo Markets in Singapore. “The Korea discount may linger for longer given the recent political debacle, and the corporate governance reforms will have to be prioritized to get any closer to erasing this discount.”South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol is fighting for his political life after his attempt to break an impasse in parliament by briefly imposing martial law backfired. The turmoil has cast a pall over the nation’s outlook and it also may impact the Corporate Value-Up program much touted by Yoon as a way to boost shareholder returns and eradicate the so-called Korea Discount, a term referring to the long depressed valuations of the country’s equities.Down more than 8% this year, the Kospi is one of the world’s worst-performing major equity indexes. Its underperformance versus Taiwan’s Taiex has deepened further this month.Taiwan’s equity-market outperformance has a lot to do with this year’s 80% surge in the shares of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the world’s top advanced chipmaker that accounts for 37% of the benchmark’s weighting. The company is the major supplier of Nvidia and Apple Inc.’s most advanced chips.In contrast, shares of Samsung Electronics Co. — South Korea’s most-valued company — have been the biggest drag on its local market. Samsung’s stock has slumped 31% in Seoul this year on concerns that the firm is missing out on the AI boom due to slow progress on technological breakthroughs and lingering management woes.Overall, Taiwan’s exposure to AI goes far beyond TSMC: over 40 AI-related firms constitute about 73% of MSCI Taiwan’s index weighting, according to Goldman Sachs Group analysts. At 33%, Korea is a distant second in Asia and features SK Hynix Inc. and Samsung Electronics only.Analysts’ average earnings per share estimate for MSCI Taiwan has risen more than 33% this year to a record high, while that for MSCI Korea has declined 5% since a peak in August, Bloomberg compiled data shows.“If you think of Nvidia’s AI server market and so on, Taiwan is heavily involved in that value chain,” said Yan Taw Boon, portfolio manager at Neuberger Berman. “Conversely, Korea has not performed as strongly as they have very little involvement in this new booming environment.”While the higher tariffs threatened by Trump are a universal challenge, there are reasons some investors believe that Taiwan’s treatment may be more nuanced and less punishing.“One will recall that many Taiwanese exports were exempt from tariffs last time around as they were key components of US tech supply chains,” JPMorgan Chase & Co. analysts including Rajiv Batra wrote in a note. “This time is likely to be the same with TSMC seen as a major part of the Global AI trade.”The Wall Street bank sees Taiwan relatively better positioned than Korea in a trade war with the US.Another buffer for Taiwanese equities is the growing presence of local investors, especially when the global investment climate turns more capricious.“Taiwan retail investors’ home bias and the still interesting AI ramp-up theme should continue to drive participation in the stock market,” said Vivian Pai, fund manager at Fidelity International. Their increased awareness of long-term investing can help form strong consistent inflows into local stocks, she added.The Taiwan dollar has weakened about 5% against the US currency this year while the Korean won has fallen around 9%.“Both Taiwan and Korea are exposed to tariffs but Taiwan’s underlying economic fundamentals are more solid,” said Eddie Cheung, a strategist at Credit Agricole CIB. “This should persist in 2025.”",Taiwan's market capitalization now exceeds South Korea's by about $950 billion. The world’s AI frontrunners from Nvidia Corp. to OpenAI all increasingly turn to Taiwanese firms for supply.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume.While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

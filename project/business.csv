ITR filing: Why are taxpayers getting messages from Income Tax Department on claims?

Why are taxpayers getting intimations?

What is the department asking taxpayers to do?



Why are refunds being delayed for some?



What happens if the intimation is ignored

The Income Tax Department on Tuesday issued a press release clarifying why several taxpayers have received emails and SMS alerts seeking a review of their tax deduction and exemption claims.The department urged taxpayers to review their deduction and exemption claims for the current assessment year and take corrective steps before the revised deadline of December 31 to avoid penalties or further scrutiny.According to the release, advanced risk analytics under its risk management framework have flagged certain Income Tax Returns (ITRs) for Assessment Year 2025-26.These include cases where deductions or exemptions appear to be ineligible, such as claims related to bogus donations to Registered Unrecognised Political Parties (RUPPs).The department also observed errors in some returns, including incorrect or invalid PAN details of donees and discrepancies in the amount of deductions or exemptions claimed.Taxpayers are being contacted via SMS and email under the department’s NUDGE (Non-intrusive Usage of Data to Guide and Enable) campaign. They are advised to review their returns and file revised ITRs, if required, by December 31, to avoid further enquiries.The Income Tax Department said the initiative reflects a “trust-first” approach, which gives taxpayers an opportunity to voluntarily correct mistakes instead of facing immediate enforcement action.Taxpayers are advised to verify their deduction and exemption claims using supporting documents and reconcile details with Form 16, Form 26AS, the Annual Information Statement (AIS) and the Taxpayer Information Summary (TIS). If errors are found, they should revise their returns within the prescribed timeline.Those whose claims are genuine and legally correct do not need to take any further action, the department clarified.The department added that taxpayers who miss the December 31 deadline may still file an updated return from January 1, 2026, as permitted under the law, though this would involve payment of additional tax.During FY 2025-26, more than 21 lakh taxpayers have already updated their ITRs for assessment years ranging from 2021-22 to 2024-25, paying over Rs 2,500 crore in taxes. For the current assessment year (AY 2025-26), over 15 lakh returns have already been revised.Several salaried taxpayers, particularly those under the old tax regime, have reported receiving intimations stating that their refund processing has been temporarily put on hold due to discrepancies in deduction claims.Tax experts say many such cases involve deductions like Sections 80C, 80D or HRA that were claimed directly in the ITR but were not declared to employers during TDS calculations.Chartered accountants have clarified that this does not automatically make a taxpayer non-compliant, as the Income Tax Act allows eligible deductions to be claimed directly while filing returns, even if they were not considered by the employer.Experts warn that ignoring such communications can have consequences. If discrepancies are not addressed, the department may disallow the deductions, leading to additional tax demand, interest, penalties, delay or cancellation of refunds and even detailed scrutiny or assessment.Tax professionals advise taxpayers not to panic but to promptly review their returns and respond appropriately to avoid future complications.",The Income Tax Department on Tuesday issued a press release clarifying why several taxpayers have received emails and SMS alerts.

Stock market today: Nifty50 and BSE Sensex , the Indian equity benchmark indices, opened in red on Wednesday. While Nifty50 was near 25,150, BSE Sensex was below 85,500. At 9:16 AM, Nifty50 was trading at 26,157.20, down 20 points or 0.076%. BSE Sensex was at 85,454.65, down 70 points or 0.082%.Experts are of the view that activity is likely to stay muted in the coming sessions due to the shortened trading week due to the Christmas holiday. The stock market is expected to hold firm at elevated levels and move within a narrow range, aided by supportive signals from global markets.Dr. VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Investments Limited says, “As 2025 draws to a close the market appears to be moving to a consolidation phase with an upward bias. The strong domestic macros and the supportive earnings growth expectations in Q3 and Q4 of FY26 and for FY27 will provide the fundamental support to the market. The sustained domestic inflows and consistent DII buying will impart resilience to the market. However, since FIIs may sell the rallies, a sharp breakout is unlikely. Also, the revival of the AI trade in the US might impact sentiments in favour of a ‘non-AI trade’ in markets like India.”“The RBI decision to do an additional OMO to the tune of Rs 2 lakh crores will significantly enhance liquidity and bring down yields. This is positive for credit growth and banking stocks. This can be a shot in the arm for banking stocks which are fairly valued.”Wall Street ended higher on Tuesday, with the S&P 500 finishing at an all-time high after a series of economic indicators were released. Among these was the GDP growth number that lifted bond yields and boosted interest in growth-oriented stocks.Asian equities opened on a positive note, tracking the overnight rally in the S&P 500, which was underpinned by data indicating that the US economy expanded at its strongest rate in two years.Gold crossed the $4,500 per ounce threshold on Wednesday for the first time, supported by increased demand for safe-haven assets and expectations that the US central bank could lower interest rates further next year. Silver and platinum also climbed to fresh record levels.In the domestic market, foreign portfolio investors were net sellers of equities worth Rs 1,795 crore on Tuesday, while domestic institutional investors stepped in as net buyers with purchases of Rs 3,812 crore.","The stock market is expected to hold firm at elevated levels and move within a narrow range, aided by supportive signals from global markets.

The WhatsApp Scam That Gives Hackers Your Phone!

Government has begun discussions with WhatsApp after the messaging app banned a high number of Indian accounts, raising concerns over the continued misuse of Indian mobile numbers for online fraud.According to people familiar with the matter, WhatsApp has been blocking an average of 9.8 million Indian accounts every month until October this year for violations of its policies. While the Meta-owned platform publishes monthly figures on such actions, authorities said that the absence of details about the mobile numbers linked to these accounts is making it harder to track spam, scams and cyber fraud, ET reported citing officials.India is WhatsApp’s largest market, and officials said the platform’s refusal to share even basic information about banned numbers is limiting the government’s ability to verify whether those numbers are genuine or fraudulently obtained. WhatsApp categorises Indian accounts using the +91 country code and said that its bans are triggered by behavioural signals that indicate policy breaches, including suspected involvement in scams.Government officials noted that banned numbers frequently reappear on other over-the-top (OTT) platforms, particularly Telegram, where they continue to be used for fraudulent activities. The wider misuse of Indian mobile numbers, by actors both within the country and abroad, remains a serious challenge, despite multiple enforcement measures.In most cases, fraudsters operate through OTT messaging apps such as WhatsApp and Telegram. Once an account is created using a mobile number, these apps can function without a SIM card, making it extremely difficult for enforcement agencies to trace offenders, officials said. They added that about 95% of digital arrest and impersonation cases are carried out on WhatsApp.“There are concerns around how Indian numbers are being used (by fraudsters) and we are addressing those issues,” one official was quoted by ET as saying.“We have to balance convenience against security implications.”Officials said tracing when a SIM card was issued and verifying whether the know-your-customer (KYC) details linked to it are genuine or fake is central to curbing such fraud. “We are talking to WhatsApp and other OTTs as to how to deal with this problem,” the official added.Separately, the government routinely asks WhatsApp and other digital platforms to block accounts found to be involved in scams or illegal activities. Data from the Department of Telecommunications shows that nearly 2.9 million WhatsApp profiles and groups were disengaged following government directions until November this year.While authorities are informed about accounts removed on official instructions, they say there is little visibility when WhatsApp independently bans accounts. The platform discloses only aggregate numbers in its reports, without specifying which mobile numbers have been disabled.“As WhatsApp does not coordinate with respective authorities concerning the banned accounts, there is no clarity as to what numbers have been banned,” another official said. “We don’t want any private details of the person, just the numbers which have been banned, so that it can be checked if the number is genuine or not.”Rakesh Maheshwari, former senior director at the Ministry of Electronics and IT (MeitY), said the purpose of monthly compliance reports was to improve platform accountability. “The whole intent of initiating this monthly compliance report and sharing it with the public was meant to bring in transparency and accountability of the platforms,” he said. “Now, if there are certain revelations which require deeper introspection, the government has further right to seek more information. ”WhatsApp has said that because its service is protected by end-to-end encryption, account enforcement relies on platform-specific behavioural indicators. It has also cited technical, legal and cross-border challenges in sharing detailed account information.“There are a number of aspects concerning banning of accounts and not all are security aspects. Some of them are based on complaints. However, sometimes they refuse to share details, which is a security concern,” a third official said.","Government has begun discussions with WhatsApp after the messaging app banned a high number of Indian accounts.

CEAT has undergone a healthy corrective phase, declining nearly 17.6% from its recent peak of ₹4,438 and moving into the ₹3,930–₹3,900 zone. This region coincides with the 50% Fibonacci retracement of the prior rally, indicating the presence of a potential demand pocket.The technical structure is showing early signs of stabilization, with falling trendline breakout indications visible on both price action and RSI, suggesting flattening momentum and a possible reversal setup. As long as ₹3,765 remains protected, the risk–reward remains favourable for a recovery move toward ₹4,300.Endurance Technologies has corrected approximately 14.5% from its peak of ₹2,986 and is currently trading near the ₹2,680–₹2,650 zone, where the stock is showing signs of stabilization. This zone aligns with the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement, the 200-DEMA, and a prior breakout region, indicating strong confluence support.Additionally, positive divergence on both RSI and MACD points toward weakening downside momentum and the possibility of a near-term trend reversal. Sustaining above ₹2,545 keeps the structure constructive for an upside move toward ₹2,850.After a sharp 42% correction since July 2025, HPL has approached a key demand zone last seen in February 2025, where strong buying interest had previously emerged.The stock has now taken out its prior swing high, signalling a potential trend shift rather than a mere relief bounce.This improvement is further supported by the daily RSI breaking above its previous swing levels, indicating strengthening momentum and renewed accumulation. If the stock holds above ₹375, the structure supports continuation toward ₹460 in the coming sessions.","According to Mehul Kothari, DVP - Technical Research, Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers, the top stocks to buy are: HPL Electric & Power, Endurance Technologies, andCEAT.

Private banks lead small business lending; PSBs lost share in last 2 years: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/private-banks-lead-small-business-lending-psbs-lost-share-in-last-2-years-report/articleshow/126170159.cms,"Private banks lead small business lending; PSBs lost share in last 2 years: Report

NEW DELHI: Private banks continue to dominate enterprise lending to small businesses in India, closely followed by public sector banks (PSBs), though the latter have seen a decline in their market share over the past two years, according to a report by Small Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI) and CRIF High Mark, India's first full-service credit information bureau.The report noted that while private banks remain the primary lenders to enterprises, non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) are steadily gaining share, particularly among sole proprietors, where they now command over 41 per cent of the lending share.In the study, ""small business"" is defined as enterprises with an aggregated credit exposure of not more than Rs 5 crore from the formal lending system.It stated, ""As of Sep'25, private banks remain the primary lenders to enterprises, though their share shows minor volatility. Public sector banks follow closely, but their share declined from 39.3 per cent in Sep'23 to 37.8 per cent in Sep'25.""The report highlighted that the reduced share of PSBs has largely been absorbed by NBFCs, reflecting a gradual shift in the lending landscape.Aggregate credit exposure to small businesses reached Rs 46 lakh crore as of September 2025, registering a robust 16.2 per cent year-on-year growth. On a quarter-on-quarter basis, growth stood at 1.5 per cent.Active loan accounts also rose strongly, increasing 11.8 per cent year-on-year to 7.3 crore accounts.The report attributed this sustained momentum to comprehensive policy initiatives for the MSME (Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises) sector, including the implementation of several government-backed credit schemes, which have played a pivotal role in supporting credit expansion.However, the pace of growth has moderated compared to the previous quarter, when year-on-year growth stood at 19.3 per cent. This moderation may reflect more cautious underwriting by lenders as well as seasonal variations, the report said.Despite this, the faster growth in credit outstanding compared to loan volumes indicates steady expansion in average ticket sizes.In terms of product mix, working capital loans dominate enterprise lending, accounting for around 57 per cent of the portfolio outstanding, while term loans continue to support capital expenditure needs. For sole proprietors, loans against property (LAP) form the largest component, followed by business loans and commercial vehicle loans.The report also shared that the unsecured lending also recorded strong momentum, with unsecured loans growing 31 per cent year-on-year despite concerns around stress in certain segments.","Private banks continue to dominate enterprise lending to small businesses.

MUMBAI: Serious Fraud Investigation Office (SFIO) has opened a formal probe into IndusInd Bank after a Dec 23, 2025 letter triggered an investigation under the Companies Act, 2013, over accounting lapses tied to internal derivative trades.In a filing, the bank said SFIO, under the MCA, seeks information after the lender flagged on June 2 issues spanning internal derivatives, unsubstantiated “other assets/liabilities”, and microfinance interest/fee income. It disclosed the update on Dec 18, pledged full cooperation, and posted details on its website.Derivatives irregularities have hit P&L by about Rs 1,960 crore as of March 31, 2025, eroding reported net worth by roughly 2.3% as of Dec 2024. Earlier profits were overstated as notional gains flowed into P&L while losses sat parked as assets, inflating NII and earnings quality. The derivatives irregularities saw several members of the senior management stepping down with the board bringing in Rajiv Anand from Axis Bank to head the private lender.The bank recognised the losses, absorbed pain in its FY25 earnings which tipped the bank into a Q4 FY25 net loss after one-off write-offs/provisions.Capital/net worth took a 2–2.5% post-tax hit, trimming buffers and nudging growth appetite and capital pricing.The derivatives loss resulted in the shares of the bank sliding as investors reassessed earnings credibility and governance. The scrutiny also sharpened on the board/management/audit committees, intensifying regulatory pressure and SFIO oversight.","The Serious Fraud Investigation Office (SFIO) has opened a formal probe into IndusInd Bank.

MUMBAI: The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) is tightening control over recurring charges, aiming to curb some opaque billing practices and give consumers clearer oversight of their subscriptions.NPCI has launched a central portal-upihelp.npci.org.in-that allows users to view and manage all their UPI autopay standing instructions in one place. The move targets so-called dark patterns, especially on e-commerce platforms, where users are nudged into accepting recurring mandates that trigger automatic monthly debits with limited visibility or easy exit.The initiative follows an NPCI circular issued on Oct 7, 2025, which overhauls the autopay framework to increase transparency and portability. By Dec 31, 2025, all members of the Unified Payments Interface network must implement the changes. Until then, existing mandates will continue uninterrupted.Under revised rules, consumers can see all active autopay mandates across apps, accessible through a ""Manage bank accounts"" or dedicated autopay section in any UPI app of their choice. More consequentially, mandates become portable. Users can shift a recurring mandate from one UPI app to another, while merchants can migrate mandates between payment providers or update their UPI IDs without altering the underlying mandate terms.NPCI has paired flexibility with guardrails. Any mandate action requires UPI PIN authentication; a specific mandate can be ported only once every 90 days; and apps are barred from using cashbacks, incentives, or persistent prompts to push users into switching.Mandate data cannot be repurposed beyond display, tightening privacy protections. Alongside these changes, NPCI has rolled out ""UPI Help,"" a conversational assistance platform.",The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) is tightening control over recurring charges.

RBI Slashes Rates After Rupee Fall, Boosts Liquidity And Lifts India’s GDP Forecast To 7.3%

MUMBAI: Government bonds rallied on Wednesday after RBI announced fresh liquidity measures to ease tight conditions, pulling the benchmark 10-year yield down to 6.54% from 6.63% on Tuesday, its biggest single-session fall since mid-May, as prices rose on expectations of durable liquidity support.Bond dealers expect the yield on the 10-year bond to drop to 6.5% as liquidity situation in the market improves gradually.The rally followed late-Tuesday measures announced by RBI to infuse around Rs 2.9 lakh crore into the banking system between Dec 29 and Jan 22 through Rs 2 lakh crore of open market bond purchases and a $10 billion, three-year dollar-rupee buy/sell swap.RBI said it will buy Rs 2 lakh crore of bonds in four tranches over Dec and Jan and conduct the $10 billion FX swap next month. On the announcement, the 10-year yield fell nine basis points, the most since early April.The planned infusion is double the liquidity injection announced earlier this month and is expected to offset the cash drain caused by RBI’s dollar sales to support the rupee, Asia’s worst-performing currency this year. The measures came after the benchmark yield climbed to a nine-month high earlier in the week amid concerns over tight liquidity and elevated debt supply.“Despite the central bank’s announcement of USDINR swaps and Open Market Operations (OMO), the measures failed to ignite market enthusiasm as they did little to bridge the widening gap between dollar supply and demand ahead of year end,” said Dilip Parmar of HDFC Securities.“The injection across these two instruments of approximately Rs 2.9 lakh crore is more than we expected. Beyond the size, we see the timing as positive, as our conversations with market participants suggested expectations for RBI to announce new measures before year-end were limited; we and the market had been thought the bank would act closer to Feb,” said Nathan Sribalasundaram of Nomura Securities.He said that while system liquidity is likely to remain in surplus, MIBOR is unlikely to fall below the repo rate, as RBI retains the ability to withdraw short-term liquidity even as it injects durable funds. The steps add to RBI’s efforts to keep borrowing costs stable and support growth when lenders’ overnight borrowing costs have risen sharply due to tax outflows and FX intervention.",Bond dealers expect the yield on the 10-year bond to drop to 6.5% as liquidity situation in the market improves gradually.

Credit card spending cools after festive bills,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/credit-card-spending-cools-after-festive-bills/articleshow/126169006.cms,"Representative image

MUMBAI: Credit card spending slowed in Nov 2025 across India as festive demand faded after Diwali and Dussehra, with transaction values and volumes easing month-on-month once seasonal shopping normalised.Total credit card spends fell to around Rs 1.9 lakh crore in Nov, down 11.9% from Rs 2.1 lakh crore in Oct, data released this week showed. A surge driven by festival-linked purchases and large e-commerce sales events was seen in Oct. With those out of the way, spending corrected largely along expected lines.Transaction volumes also moderated, slipping 3% month-on-month to around 50.3 crore transactions from about 51.8 crore in Oct, indicating a cooling in activity after the festive peak rather than a sharp pullback.All major banks reported a month-on-month decline in spending. However, HDFC Bank witnessed a comparatively softer decline of 10% MoM, while Axis Bank ICICI Bank , and SBI saw sharper declines of 15.9%, 15.8%, and 15.2%, respectively. In contrast, Federal Bank reported an increase in spending of 8% month-on-month, said Akshay Tiwari, analyst with Asit Mehta.Offline spending bore the larger brunt of the slowdown. Point-of-sale spends dropped 14.4% to around Rs 75,640 crore, reflecting the front-loading of high-value purchases such as jewellery, electronics, and automobiles into Oct.Online spends proved relatively resilient, declining 10.1% to around Rs 1.1 lakh crore, supported by recurring payments and routine expenses that are less sensitive to seasonality.Credit card usage rose on a year-on-year basis. Spends in Nov were 11.1% higher than a year earlier, while transaction volumes jumped 29% from about 390 million in Nov 2024, pointing to continued structural growth in card usage.According to Tiwari, the relatively lower decline in HDFC Bank’s spends translated into a market share gain of 50 basis points (100bps = 1 percentage point). Conversely, SBI, Axis Bank, and ICICI Bank lost market share by 70bps, 52bps, and 36bps, respectively. Among mid-cap banks, Federal Bank gained 16bps, while IndusInd Bank gained 21bps, recovering partially after losing 209bps of market share between July 2025 and Oct 2025.The divergence between slower growth in value and faster growth in volumes suggests a shift towards smaller, more frequent transactions.Average ticket sizes fell across channels, reinforcing the trend of credit cards being used increasingly for everyday payments rather than only large discretionary purchases, aided by their wider use on UPI platforms.Industry participants said the Nov slowdown reflected a normalisation after an unusually strong festive month rather than a weakening in underlying demand. With the wedding season and year-end travel picking up in Dec, spending momentum is expected to improve after a brief pause.“Transaction volumes declined by 3% MoM but increased 27.3% YoY, however, on a lower base. Among major banks, all reported a decline in volumes on a monthly basis. Axis Bank saw the sharpest decline at 7%, followed by SBI at 5%, and HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank at 3% each.Similar to spending trends, Federal Bank stood out with a 39% MoM increase in transaction volumes, resulting in a 46 basis point market share gain, from 1.1% to 1.5%. Axis Bank was the biggest market share loser, declining by 56 basis points, from 14.8% to 14.2%,” said Tiwari in a report.","Total credit card spends fell to around Rs 1.9 lakh crore in Nov, down 11.9%.

Oil change: BP to exit Castrol India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/oil-change-bp-to-exit-castrol-india/articleshow/126168990.cms,"Representative image (Picture credit: AP)

MUMBAI: Castrol India is set for a change in ownership, with New York-based investment firm Stonepeak to acquire a majority stake in the lubricants maker from Britain’s BP as part of a $6-billion global deal.BP owns 51% of Castrol India, with the remaining 49% held by public shareholders. In line with India’s takeover regulations, Stonepeak, along with Canada’s pension fund CPPI has made an open offer to buy an additional 26% stake from public shareholders at Rs 194 per share, involving an outlay of Rs 4,990 crore, UBS Securities India, the manager to the offer, said. The offer price is marginally higher than Castrol India’s Wednesday closing price of Rs 189.6 on the BSE.The deal marks a scaling back of BP’s footprint in India, where it has long been one of the largest international energy players. Under the global agreement, BP will sell 65% of Castrol to Stonepeak at an enterprise valuation of $10.1 billion, with an option to divest the remaining 35% after a two-year lock-in. CPPI will invest $1.1 billion as part of the deal.BP had acquired the 126-year-old Castrol brand from Burmah Castrol in 2000.The deal also covers BP’s minority holdings in Castrol operations across several markets, including India (49%), Vietnam (35%), Saudi Arabia (50%) and Thailand (40%), the oil giant said. However, according to Castrol India’s disclosures to the Indian stock exchanges, Stonepeak will indirectly acquire 51% of the company.The consideration will be paid partly in cash to BP and partly through a share-swap, under which Stonepeak will issue 35% equity shares to BPMH, an indirect subsidiary of BP.“The transaction contemplates an indirect transfer of 51% equity stake in Castrol India. The offshore consideration — comprising cash and a 35% non-controlling equity interest in the Stonepeak acquiring entity shall be subject to Indian indirect transfer tax framework and tax treaty benefits.The structure is reminiscent of earlier landmark transactions such as Adani Group’s acquisition of Holcim’s indirect holdings in Ambuja Cements and ACC, as well as Vodafone’s acquisition of Hutchison’s Indian telecom business through acquisition of an offshore holding company,” said Deep Chandan, executive director, Katalyst Advisors.Once the deal is completed, BP’s nominee directors will step down from Castrol India’s board, paving the way for Stonepeak, which manages over $80 billion in assets, to appoint its own representatives.The Castrol India acquisition strengthens Stonepeak’s presence in the country, where it has invested in sectors such as data centres. If Stonepeak and CPPI manage to acquire the full 26% stake through the open offer, their combined share in Castrol India will increase to 77%. In that event, the new promoters will be required to dilute their stake to 75% to meet India’s minimum public shareholding norms.The Castrol stake sale is part of BP’s broader efforts to reshape its business, strip out costs, and strengthen its balance sheet. Earlier, RIL, Saudi Aramco, and private equity firms Apollo Global Management and Lone Star Funds were reported to be among potential suitors for Castrol.Apart from Castrol India, BP’s interests in India span petrochemical technology licensing, oil and gas trading, IT and financial services, and staffing for its global marine fleet. BP also has JVs with RIL including Reliance BP Mobility, which operates Jio-bp fuel outlets, and India Gas Solutions, which sources and markets gas in India.","BP owns 51% of Castrol India, with the remaining 49% held by public shareholders.

PAN-Aadhaar Deadline Nears: How To Link Before December 31 Or Risk Inoperative PAN From Next Year

How To Link PAN With Aadhaar Card: Step-By-Step Guide

To begin with, you will have to pay a mandatory fee through the Income Tax Department’s e-Filing portal.

Visit the portal homepage (https://www.incometax.gov.in/iec/foportal/), select the Link Aadhaar option under Quick Links. Now enter your PAN card and Aadhaar card details.

After choosing to pay through e-Pay Tax, you are required to re-enter your PAN, verify your mobile number through an OTP, select the Income Tax option, and proceed to payment.

The assessment year must be selected and the payment category should be marked as Other Receipts (500). The Rs 1,000 amount is auto-filled and can be paid using net banking, debit card, or UPI. The payment may take four to five working days to reflect in the system.

Once the payment is confirmed (which can take a few days), taxpayers can make the linking request.

Go to the Link Aadhaar section, enter your PAN and Aadhaar details, and validate the information.

A confirmation message stating ""Your payment details are verified."" should appear, after which users must enter their name as per Aadhaar and their mobile number.

They are also required to confirm Aadhaar validation and indicate if only the year of birth is mentioned on their Aadhaar record.

The process is completed by entering the six-digit OTP sent to the registered mobile number.

Taxpayers can also check the status of their PAN-Aadhaar linkage without logging in. By selecting Link Aadhaar Status under Quick Links on the e-Filing homepage and entering PAN and Aadhaar details, users can view the current status. A successful linkage is indicated by a green checkmark, while pending cases will display a message stating that the request has been forwarded to UIDAI for validation.

The final date to complete your PAN–Aadhaar card linkage is December 31, 2025. Beginning January 1, 2026, the Income Tax Department will declare all PANs that remain unlinked as inoperative.As per Notification No. 26/2025, issued on April 3, 2025, individuals who were allotted a PAN using an Aadhaar Enrolment ID before October 1, 2024 are required to complete the linkage using their permanent Aadhaar card number by the end of 2025. PAN cards that are not linked by the deadline will be marked inactive or inoperative and cannot be used for tax-related or major financial transactions, according to an ET report.The Central Board of Direct Taxes has cautioned that non-compliance will have financial consequences, including suspension of income tax refunds and the application of higher tax deduction at source rates from January 1, 2026.To complete the linkage, taxpayers must first ensure they have a valid PAN, an Aadhaar number, and a registered mobile phone to receive one-time passwords. A fee of Rs 1,000 is applicable in cases where the PAN was issued before July 1, 2017 and has not been linked earlier, the report said.","Taxpayers must first ensure they have a valid PAN, an Aadhaar number, and a registered mobile phone to receive one-time passwords.

What is NUDGE campaign?

ITR filing & Refunds: Why are taxpayers getting ‘nudges’?

What kind of exemptions and deductions are likely under scrutiny?

What should taxpayers do if they get a ‘nudge’ from tax authorities?

Amarpal Chadha shares a checklist:

Verify Deductions and Exemptions: Check all deductions and exemptions claimed in the income-tax return and ensure adequate documentation exists to substantiate each claim

Check all deductions and exemptions claimed in the income-tax return and ensure adequate documentation exists to substantiate each claim Identify Discrepancies: Compare the return filed with Form 16, bank statements, investment proofs, and other records to spot any discrepancies.

ITR filing FY 2024-25 (AY 2025-26): The Income Tax Department is stepping up scrutiny for tax returns and many taxpayers are getting alerts to check their exemption and deduction claims. The last date to file income tax returns for FY 2024-25 was pushed to September 15, 2025 this year since the tax department took time to release forms and update the portal. However, the last date to file an updated or belated return for the current assessment year remains December 31, 2025.Several taxpayers are also facing delays in their returns and refunds being processed. Ahead of the important deadline, the Income Tax Department has issued a clarification on why some taxpayers are getting alerts to review their ITRs.The Income Tax Department has said that in the ongoing financial year 2025–26, over 21 lakh taxpayers have already updated their ITRs for AYs 2021–22 to 2024–25 and paid more than ₹2,500 crore in taxes. Also, over 15 lakh ITRs have been revised for the current assessment year.In a press release, the Income Tax Department has said that some taxpayers have claimed ‘ineligible’ refunds - through the deductions and exemptions route. This has led to their income being underreported.“Under the risk management framework, and through the use of advanced data analytics, cases for Assessment Year (AY) 2025–26 have been identified,” the Income Tax Department said.The tax department on its part is ‘nudging’ taxpayers to update their tax returns in case there is some discrepancy in the deductions and exemptions.Identified taxpayers are being sent SMS and email under the government’s “Non-intrusive Usage of Data to Guide and Enable (NUDGE)” campaign. The aim is to encourage these taxpayers to correct errors in tax return filing, ahead of the December 31, 2025 deadline.“This initiative reflects a trust-first approach to tax administration, under which taxpayers are provided an opportunity to review their Income-tax Returns (ITRs) and voluntarily correct any ineligible claims, wherever required,” the tax department said.“The campaign leverages data analytics and technology to enable a transparent, non-intrusive, and taxpayer-centric compliance environment, with an emphasis on guidance and voluntary compliance,” the department adds.The tax department has advised the concerned taxpayers to “review their ITRs, verify the correctness of their deduction and exemption claims, and revise their returns, if required, within the prescribed time by 31 December 2025, so as to avoid further enquiries in the matter.”Amarpal Chadha, Tax Partner at EY India explains that the NUDGE campaign is an initiative of the Income Tax Department aimed at encouraging taxpayers to voluntarily review deduction or exemption claims that have been identified as potentially ineligible through data analytics.The Department is also leveraging global information-exchange frameworks such as the Automatic Exchange of Information (AEOI), Common Reporting Standards (CRS), and the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) to identify possible discrepancies in foreign asset reporting, Chadha told TOI.Under the tax department’s initiative, taxpayers may receive an email or SMS explaining the reason for the communication and advising them to verify the accuracy of deductions or exemptions claimed, as well as the correctness of foreign asset disclosures. Where a taxpayer believes that corrective action is required, a revised return may be filed on or before December 31, 2025, which is the deadline for filing updated income tax returns for FY 2024-25Tanu Gupta, Partner, Mainstay Tax Advisors LLP has a clear message: In principle, all those exemptions and deductions which are not genuine are likely to come under scrutiny.“Even those deductions and exemptions which are inconsistent with the income tax department's records/information/data, may also come under scrutiny. The most sought-after deduction/exemption currently includes ""Donation to Political Parties"", ""House Rent Allowance"" to name a few,” she told TOI.According to Amarpal Chadha, any deduction that is claimed for donations to political parties where an incorrect or invalid PAN of the donee has been provided may come under the Income Tax Department’s scrutiny.The tax department has said that there are also cases where the taxpayers have given incorrect or invalid PAN details. Other cases pertain to the extent of deductions and exemptions that are being claimed by the taxpayers.“In addition, any deduction or exemption claimed in the income-tax return over and above what is reflected in Form 16 such as HRA exemption, exemptions under the Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (DTAA), gratuity exemption etc. are also under tax department’s radar,” he told TOI.Tanu Gupta recommends that for all the claims including exemptions and deductions, the taxpayer should always keep in handy the following documents: receipts / invoices of the payments for which exemption / deduction is claimed, bank statement evidencing such payment through proper banking channels, receipts from the recipient to corroborate with such payments.These are broad guidelines for the documents which the taxpayer should anyway keep on files for a good financial housekeeping, she says.Is there a need for panic? No, says Tanu Gupta. “Instead, the taxpayer needs to revisit their claims of exemptions and deductions in the return and take action accordingly viz file the revised return if needed. As the name suggests, the abbreviation and the complete name of it (Non-Intrusive Usage of Data to Guide and Enable), it is to facilitate the taxpayer to file compliant tax returns voluntarily, with correct, justified and genuine claims of deductions/exemptions,” she tells TOI.“There are cases where the taxpayers have received the communication from the department, although they believe that they do not have any inconsistency for the claims made in the return. They only need to see if they have all supporting documents for such payments to submit to the tax authorities when asked for,” explains Tanu Gupta, adding that wherever such exemptions / deductions are not authentic, the taxpayer needs to immediately revise the tax return by reversing such claims in the returns; and pay due income tax along with interest.If any claim or reporting needs correction, file a revised return within the prescribed timeline currently on or before December 31, 2025, he says.“However, if the taxpayer believes that the exemptions or deductions claimed are accurate and valid, they may wait for further communication from the Income Tax Department,” he adds.It is important to restate here that taxpayers do not have to worry where their tax claims are genuine.The Income Tax Department has clarified that taxpayers whose claims are genuine and correctly made in accordance with law are not required to take any further action.“It is clarified that taxpayers who do not avail of this opportunity may still file an updated return from 1 January 2026, as permitted under law, subject to payment of additional tax liability,” it has said.","Identified taxpayers are being sent SMS and email under the government’s “Non- intrusive Usage of Data to Guide and Enable (NUDGE)” campaign. The aim is to encourage these taxpayers to correct errors in tax return filing, ahead of the December 31, 2025 deadline.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126159165,imgsize-48186,width-400,resizemode-4/income-tax-return.jpg"
US 30-Year Mortgage Rates Fall to 6.18%: Are Buyers Still Cautious?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-mortgage-rate-us-30-year-home-loan-rates-edge-down-to-6-18-affordability-concerns-keep-buyers-cautious/articleshow/126164122.cms,"The average interest rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage in the US edged slightly lower this week but continued to hover within a narrow range that has prevailed for nearly two months, offering only modest relief to homebuyers.The benchmark long-term mortgage rate slipped to 6.18% from 6.21% last week, mortgage buyer Freddie Mac said on Wednesday. A year ago, the average rate stood at 6.85%, according to data cited by the AP.Borrowing costs moved the other way for 15-year fixed-rate mortgages, which are commonly used by homeowners refinancing their loans. The average rate rose to 5.50% from 5.47% a week earlier, compared with 6% a year ago, Freddie Mac said.Mortgage rates are influenced by a range of factors, including the Federal Reserve’s interest-rate decisions and investor expectations around inflation and economic growth. They typically track the 10-year US Treasury yield, which lenders use as a benchmark when pricing home loans.The 10-year Treasury yield stood at 4.15% by midday Wednesday, slightly higher than last week’s 4.12%.Freddie Mac data show that the 30-year mortgage rate has remained largely stable since October 30, when it dipped to 6.17%, its lowest level in more than a year.Rates began easing in July amid expectations of Federal Reserve rate cuts, which started in September and continued this month.While the Fed does not directly set mortgage rates, cuts to short-term rates can signal easing inflation or slower growth, prompting investors to buy US government bonds. That can push down long-term Treasury yields and, in turn, mortgage rates. However, rate cuts do not always lead to lower mortgage borrowing costs.Housing market conditions have improved slightly compared with a year ago. Home listings have risen sharply, and many sellers have lowered asking prices as properties take longer to sell, according to Realtor.com data. Buyers who can pay cash or manage current mortgage rates are in a stronger position than last year.Even so, affordability remains a major hurdle, particularly for first-time buyers without home equity.

'India Got Out Of The Gates Faster Than Most Nations', Says US Expert As Trade Deal Talks Nears End

US economy under pressure

Where this leaves the world

""The golden age of America begins right now,"" Donald Trump declared as he launched his second stint in the White House. Back in the presidency, he wasted no time signaling that this term would be markedly different from his first.Trump's biggest leverage this time: tariffs. Unlike before, trade would no longer be managed quietly through negotiations and frameworks—it would be enforced.In less than a year, MAGA supremo has turned tariffs into the central weapon of American foreign policy, unsettling allies, pressuring rivals and forcing governments across continents to recalculate their economic strategies. What began as an effort to ""put America first"" has since evolved into a global stress test -- of markets, diplomacy and America's own economy.Moments after taking office in January, Trump made it clear that America's trading partners would now operate on his terms. He revived a belief he has held for decades: that tariffs are not merely economic instruments, but levers of power -- tools to extract concessions, reshape behaviour and reassert US hegemony, with his doctrine of ""Make America Great Again"".That philosophy has defined the year 2025. Tariff rates have been announced, escalated, rolled back and reintroduced, often with little notice, keeping governments, markets and businesses on edge.In some cases, the pressure has produced partial deals. In others, it has hardened resistance. In almost all, it has altered the tone of global trade.Trump has justified the approach as part of a broader mission to revive American manufacturing, reduce trade deficits and protect domestic industry. But the scope of his actions has extended far beyond economics. Trade policy has become inseparable from his views on geopolitics, alliances and conflict, particularly the war in Ukraine and his simmering frustrations with Russia.That convergence is visible in how Trump has treated different countries. Large emerging economies such as China and India have faced some of the sharpest measures, often accompanied by rhetoric linking tariffs to security, energy purchases or geopolitical alignment. Neighbours Canada and Mexico have been pulled into tariff standoffs over migration, water disputes and regulatory issues. Venezuela has been targeted with sweeping secondary sanctions. Countries seen as cooperative, meanwhile, have often received exemptions, pauses or negotiated ceilings.However, he has been noticeably more restrained toward countries that have eagerly echoed Trump’s rhetoric, showered him with the praise he craves, and even gone so far as to nominate him for a Nobel Peace Prize.The numbers underline the scale of the shift. According to the Yale Budget Lab, the average US tariff rate has climbed to nearly 17%, up from under 3% at the end of 2024. The measures now generate roughly $30 billion a month for the US Treasury, a revenue stream the administration has openly touted.The global response has been swift. As CNBC reported, leaders from Europe to Asia have made repeated trips to Washington seeking carve-outs, exemptions or negotiated limits, often in return for promises of new investment on US soil. Framework agreements have been reached with partners including the European Union, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Japan, South Korea and Vietnam. Yet the most consequential relationships, with China and India, remain unresolved.In April, it began with a jolt: Trump imposed a 104% tariff on Beijing, a decision announced by White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt.Trump's renewed tariff war opened with a heavy hand on China, rolling out a startling 145% duty on Chinese goods. Beijing hit back swiftly with a 125% tariff on US products, escalating the tug of war between the world’s two biggest economies. But the shock phase was short-lived. Within months, Washington softened its stance and scaled the tariff down to 30%, with further negotiations now under way.Yet China, the United States' biggest economic rival, absorbed the blow. Beijing's trade surplus defied Trump's tariff shock, climbing past a trillion dollars as China diversified away from the US, moved its manufacturing sector up the value chain, and relied on its strategic dominance in rare earth minerals, crucial to Western defence and technology, to push back against pressure from Washington and Europe.Chinese exports have remained resilient despite a 55% levy on shipments to the US, suggesting Beijing still has room to absorb more pain. For Trump, escalating the confrontation risks provoking Chinese curbs on rare earth supplies that are vital for American production of everything from smartphones to missiles.Tensions rose further on October 9, when Beijing expanded export controls to include 12 of 17 rare-earth metals and key refining equipment, effective December 1. China accused Washington of harming its interests and souring the atmosphere of trade talks. Earlier, Beijing criticised Trump’s tariff threats as ""double standards"" after he warned of an additional 100% duty in response to China’s curbs on rare earth exports.Despite frequent flare-ups, neither side can afford an escalated dispute, it would be a tightrope for both economies. Negotiations continue. Xi Jinping and Donald Trump met in October, with plans for more meetings ahead.Their discussions in South Korea covered trade, Taiwan, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and the fentanyl crisis, according to both governments.The tug of war between Washington and Beijing is far from over. Efforts to stabilise ties loom large, especially as a tentative detente reached this year expires in late 2026. Trump and Xi are expected to meet twice next year as both sides try to prevent the world's two biggest economies from sliding into a deeper confrontation.Canada and Mexico, America’s closest neighbours, have endured a year of strained relations under Trump. His long-standing complaints over drug trafficking, migration, water disputes and trade imbalances resurfaced forcefully, this time backed by tariff threats.For Canada, the impact has been severe. In March, the US slapped a 25% tariff on Canadian goods, later raising it to 35%, with an additional 10% looming. Prime Minister Mark Carney, then new in office, found himself grappling with the steepest US trade restrictions in decades.On February 1, Trump signed executive orders imposing 25% tariffs on all Mexican and Canadian goods, except Canadian oil and energy exports, which faced a lower 10% rate. The move threw North American supply chains into turmoil.The US has since issued a list of demands for restoring freer trade with Canada: opening its dairy market, removing penalties on American digital platforms under Canada’s Online Streaming Act, and lifting provincial bans on US liquor. The demands were spelled out by US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer as part of an ongoing USMCA review.Canada has also been hit by additional Section 232 tariffs on steel, aluminium, autos, copper and wood, a revival of Trump’s first-term playbook.Mexico, meanwhile, faced a 30% tariff from August 1 after trade negotiations stalled. Trump later added another 5%, accusing Mexico of violating a cross-border water treaty.Mexico’s economy remains deeply integrated with the US, with more than $1 billion in daily bilateral commerce. Mexico’s recently imposed 50% tariff on India has been widely interpreted as a move influenced by pressure from Washington, and an attempt to stay aligned with the US ahead of the next USMCA review.Mexico and Canada already faced tariffs before this year’s reciprocal move, 25% and 35% on goods outside the USMCA, which is due for review in 2026.Trump’s relationship with Prime Minister Narendra Modi has often appeared warm. The US President has repeatedly spoken of his bond with PM Modi , calling him a ""great friend."" But his trade policy toward India tells a very different story.On August 1, the US imposed a 25% tariff on Indian goods, doubling it to 50% by August 27, along with an additional “penalty” linked to India’s ties with Russia. Trump accused India of maintaining some of the world’s highest tariffs and “obnoxious” non-monetary trade barriers, while also buying large volumes of Russian oil at a time when, as he put it, “everyone wants Russia to stop the killing in Ukraine.”His sharpest remark came in July: “I don’t care what India does with Russia. They can take their dead economies down together, for all I care.”India pushed back firmly. Union commerce minister Piyush Goyal rejected Trump’s description of India as a “dead economy”, asserting that despite the hurdles imposed by the US administration, the country remained on track to become the world’s third-largest economy.“We have risen from the 11th largest economy to one of the top five economies driven by our reforms, the hard work of our farmers, MSMEs and entrepreneurs. It is widely expected that we will become the third-largest economy in a few years,” he said.India’s exports to the US did fall sharply after the tariff hikes, dropping 28.5% between May and October 2025. Yet, in a notable turnaround, overall exports surged 19.4% in November to $38.1 billion, with shipments rising not only to China but also to the US.Trump has repeatedly cast Brics as a threat to the dollar, claiming the bloc was “set up to hurt us.” He has warned that any country aligning with Brics would face tariffs from the US.""I told anybody who wants to be in Brics, that's fine, but we’re going to put tariffs on your nation,"" Trump said. He has repeatedly argued that Brics was designed to promote ""de-dollarisation"", weaken the Bretton Woods system and dilute American influence.Yet the reality has moved in the opposite direction. Brics has expanded from five members to ten -- Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, the UAE and Indonesia -- with ten more designated as partner states. Several others, including Pakistan and Sri Lanka, have applied to join.The expansion has clearly unsettled Washington. Trump has insisted countries are “dropping out” of Brics, but the bloc has continued to grow, underscoring the limits of tariff threats as a deterrent.Trump’s tensions with Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva -- and his open support for former leader Jair Bolsonaro -- shaped Washington’s trade posture toward Brazil this year.The US imposed a 40% tariff on Brazilian goods, later raising total duties to 50%, citing threats to US national security. The move was widely seen as political as much as economic, particularly amid Trump’s criticism of Brazil’s judiciary and its handling of Bolsonaro-related cases.By November, however, the White House began to retreat. Facing rising domestic food prices, Trump rolled back tariffs on Brazilian beef, cocoa, coffee and fruit, mirroring similar reversals elsewhere as inflation concerns mounted at home.After failing to influence Brazil’s judicial process, Trump was compelled to engage directly with Lula’s government, softening some of the earlier punitive measures.Trump’s crackdown on Venezuela has been among the harshest of his second term. He declared that any country purchasing Venezuelan oil or gas would face a 25% tariff on all trade with the US, a sweeping “secondary tariff” aimed largely at China, Venezuela’s biggest customer.Last week, Trump ordered a “complete blockade” of tankers moving in and out of Venezuelan waters, choking off what remains of the country’s oil lifeline.Trump has accused President Nicolás Maduro of sending migrants, criminals and drug traffickers into the US, claims he has offered no evidence for. US warships now patrol the region, and clashes at sea have resulted in fatalities.Venezuela, home to the world’s largest proven oil reserves, now accounts for less than 1% of global output — a collapse deepened by years of sanctions and reinforced by Trump’s latest measures.For now, the golden age remains elusive.Trump campaigned on reviving industry, lowering prices and creating jobs “like never before.” But the economic record under his tariff-heavy approach has been mixed.Manufacturing employment has barely grown since January, with factory jobs increasing in only two out of ten months this year. At the same time, the abrupt tariff hikes triggered price pressures across several sectors, from automobiles to consumer goods.The White House itself has acknowledged the strain. “More painful than I expected,” chief of staff Susie Wiles conceded, reflecting internal concerns over the pace and scale of the rollout.Economists remain divided on whether Trump’s tariffs will cause a temporary spike in inflation or lead to more persistent price rises. The Federal Reserve has been weighing the impact for months, factoring trade uncertainty into its policy outlook.Sensing political risk, the administration has begun easing some of the pressure. Tariffs on select agricultural imports, including beef, tomatoes, coffee and bananas, have been lowered, while a $12 billion aid package for farmers has been announced. Discussions on stimulus checks funded by tariff revenues have also surfaced.In less than a year, Trump has reshaped the global trading system, unsettling allies, pressuring adversaries and attempting to rewire America’s place in the world through tariffs rather than treaties.But as India and China push back, Brics expands and the US economy absorbs tariff-induced strain, the limits of this strategy are becoming clearer.Trump's strong alignment to his MAGA doctrine will restore American strength and manufacturing might. It risks isolating the US and accelerating the very multipolar shift he set out to prevent.For now, the outcome remains uncertain. What is clear is that global trade has entered a more volatile phase, one shaped as much by political calculation as by economic logic.The larger question, still unanswered, is whether Trump’s tariff wars are restoring American primacy, or hastening the rise of a world no longer willing to bend to Washington’s terms.","Trump's biggest leverage this time: tariffs. Unlike before, trade would no longer be managed quietly through negotiations and frameworks. In less than a year, MAGA supremo has turned tariffs into the central weapon of American foreign policy.

A US district court judge has upheld President Donald Trump’s decision to impose a $100,000 entry-fee on new H-1B visa workers hired from outside the US, delivering a significant legal win to the administration’s assertion of broad executive authority over immigration.In an order issued on Tuesday night, Judge Beryl A. Howell, of the Columbia district court, rejected a legal challenge brought by the US Chamber of Commerce, holding that the proclamation fell squarely within powers granted to the President under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). The court denied the business lobby’s request to block the fee and granted a summary judgment in favour of the Trump administration.Trump had announced the steep levy through a September 19 proclamation, triggering sharp concern among businesses that rely on foreign talent for specialised roles.The Chamber had argued that the new fee is unlawful because it overrides provisions of the INA that govern the H-1B program, including the requirement that fees be based on the costs incurred by the government in processing visas. It had also pointed out that the administrative procedures such as a public notice and inviting public comments had been bypassed.Rejecting those claims, Judge Howell said the Trump administration had met the conditions necessary to invoke statutory authority allowing the President to restrict entry of foreign nationals deemed detrimental to US interests. “The lawfulness of the Proclamation and its implementation rests on a straightforward reading of congressional statutes giving the President broad authority to regulate entry into the United States for immigrants and nonimmigrants alike,” her order stated.The Judge added that disputes over the policy’s wisdom lay outside the court’s remit. “So long as the actions dictated by the policy decision and articulated in the Proclamation fit within the confines of the law, the Proclamation must be upheld,” Judge Howell said.Following the proclamation, in Oct federal immigration agencies had issued a clarification diluting the impact to an extent. The clarification provided that fee would apply only to new H-1B petitions filed for workers hired from abroad, and not to existing H-1B employees or foreign students already in the US who transition to H-1B status from within the US.In response to the verdict, Daryl Joseffer, Executive Vice President and Chief Counsel of the US Chamber of Commerce, issued a statement, “The $100,000 fee makes H-1B visas cost prohibitive for businesses, especially small- and medium-sized businesses that can least afford it. We are disappointed in the court’s decision and are considering further legal options to ensure that the H-1B visa program can operate as Congress intended: to enable American businesses of all sizes to access the global talent they need to grow their operations. ”The lawsuit was one of the three filed against the entry-fee. Global Nurse Force with a coalition of US healthcare providers, educational institutions and others was the first to challenge the entry-fee by filing a law suit in the US District Court (Northern District of California). More recently, California and Massachusetts Attorneys General Rob Bonta and Andrea Joy Campbell, respectively, led a group of 20 Democratic‑led states in filing a law suit challenging this fee. Immigration attorneys state that all is not lost, especially since these other cases have different grounds of arguments.","A US district court judge has upheld President Donald Trump’s decision to impose a $100,000 entry-fee on new H-1B visa workers hired from outside the US.

Pakistan saw a 14% rise in foreign loans and grants during the first five months of the current fiscal year (July–November 2025), reaching $3.032 billion compared to $2.667 billion in the same period last year.Of the total inflows, foreign loans rose 46.2% to $2.521 billion, while grants fell by 43% to $54 million. In November alone, inflows amounted to $511 million, slightly higher than October’s $471 million but 46% lower than November 2024.Earlier this month, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) approved a $1.2 billion disbursement. The current inflow figures do not yet include this latest IMF release, as reported by Dawn.The government has set a target of $19.9 billion in total foreign inflows for the current fiscal year, slightly higher than last year’s $19.4 billion.The Ministry of Economic Affairs reported that of the $3.032 billion inflows, $1.157 billion was for project financing, while $1.875 billion comprised non-project inflows. Loans for budget support stood at $966 million, against an annual target of $13.5 billion.Additionally, Pakistan mobilised $500 million under the Saudi Oil facility at a planned rate of $100 million per month.Inflows from bilateral and multilateral lenders totalled $2.066 billion in the first five months, compared to $1.73 billion in the same period last year, according to Dawn.Pakistan received $1.258 billion from multilateral lenders and $808 million from other bilateral lenders. Remittances from overseas Pakistanis also rose to $966 million, exceeding the annual target of $609 million.The IMF’s support comes amid Pakistan’s heavy reliance on external financing. The country narrowly avoided default in 2023 and is now among the Fund’s largest borrowers after Argentina and Ukraine.Earlier this month, the IMF approved a $1.2 billion disbursement under Pakistan’s ongoing Extended Fund Facility and Resilience and Sustainability Facility programmes.This latest move lifts Pakistan’s total inflows from the IMF to roughly $3.3 billion and will be reflected in official accounts in the coming weeks.IMF officials have highlighted that Pakistan’s policy implementation has remained broadly consistent with programme goals, even after the recent monsoon floods that killed more than 1,000 people.The Fund observed that fiscal discipline, including maintaining a primary surplus of 1.3% of GDP in FY25, helped preserve macroeconomic stability. Gross reserves reached $14.5 billion at the end of FY25, up from $9.4 billion a year earlier and are expected to expand further in FY26.The Fund also stressed that Pakistan’s ongoing reform measures, including tax policy adjustments, energy sector restructuring and governance improvements, are critical to maintaining financial stability and supporting medium-term growth.As part of ongoing support, the IMF has imposed 11 new conditions on Pakistan, bringing the total to 64 over 18 months. These measures address governance flaws, corruption, tax reforms, the power sector and structural inefficiencies.

Why was the lottery system changed?

H-1B visa burden

Clampdown may hit Indian IT firms?

What can be the impact on Indian professionals?

NEW DELHI: After US President Donald Trump's proposal to impose a $100,000 entry fee on new H-1B visa applications, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has announced a major overhaul of the visa selection process replacing the long-standing random lottery system with a wage-weighted selection model.In a statement on Tuesday, the department said it is amending rules governing the H-1B visa programme to ""implement a weighted selection process that will increase the probability that H-1B visas are allocated to higher-skilled and higher-paid"" applicants, with the stated aim of protecting the wages, working conditions and job opportunities of American workers.The new guidance comes amid an intensifying crackdown by the Trump administration on immigration, both legal and illegal including the H-1B programme, which US companies rely on to hire foreign talent. Indian professionals form one of the largest groups of H-1B visa holders in the United States.The H-1B programme allows US employers especially technology firms to hire foreign workers in specialised fields. Visas are typically valid for three to six years.Until now, total H-1B fees generally ranged between $2,000 and $5,000. Under Trump’s order, the fee for new H-1B applications would jump to $100,000, dramatically raising hiring costs for employers.Under the current system, H-1B visas are allocated through a random lottery after electronic registrations, as demand far exceeds the annual quota of 85,000 visas (65,000 regular cap plus 20,000 for advanced degree holders).That system will now change.Under the new rule, H-1B visas will no longer be allocated purely by chance. Instead, registrations will be weighted based on wage levels set by the US Department of Labour (DOL). Applicants offered higher salaries will have a better chance of selection.The new rule, released on Tuesday night, will take effect from February 27, 2026, ahead of the FY 2027 H-1B cap registration season. H-1B e-registrations typically open in March.US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) said the existing lottery system was prone to abuse. USCIS said the random lottery allowed some employers to flood the system with lower-wage applications, hurting American workers.""The existing random selection process of H-1B registrations was exploited and abused by US employers who were primarily seeking to import foreign workers at lower wages than they would pay American workers,"" USCIS spokesman Matthew Tragesser said, PTI reported.""The new weighted selection will better serve Congress' intent for the H-1B program and strengthen America's competitiveness by incentivising American employers to petition for higher-paid, higher-skilled foreign workers. With these regulatory changes and others in the future, we will continue to update the H-1B program to help American businesses without allowing the abuse that was harming American workers,"" he added.USCIS said the reform is part of a broader effort to strengthen the integrity of the H-1B programme and aligns with other changes, including Trump’s proclamation imposing an additional $100,000 per visa.""As part of the Trump Administration's commitment to H-1B reform, we will continue to demand more from both employers and aliens so as not to undercut American workers and to put America first,"" Tragesser added.Trump’s renewed crackdown on immigration and H-1B visas is expected to impact Indian IT majors, particularly Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and Infosys, according to an analysis.A Bloomberg News study said the impact would be especially sharp for international staffing firms that act as intermediaries for US companies seeking H-1B talent. These include Tata Consultancy Services Ltd., Infosys Ltd. and Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.This year, Amazon emerged as the largest recipient, with over 10,000 visas approved, followed by TCS, Microsoft, Apple and Google. California continues to host the highest number of H-1B workers.Indian nationals form the largest group of H-1B visa holders. In the fiscal year ending September 2024, 80,449 of the 1.41 lakh H-1B approvals (57%) were for Indian beneficiaries, according to USCIS.However, analysis by the National Foundation for American Policy (NFAP) suggests the new system will heavily favour senior professionals. The probability of selection would rise 107% for Level IV wage earners, but fall 48% for Level I workers.This means entry-level professionals and recent international graduates from US universities with many of them Indians, could face steep barriers.From December 15, the US State Department began enhanced screening and vetting of H-1B and dependent H-4 visa applicants, including checks of their social media profiles.The tighter scrutiny has also led to several H-1B visa interviews across India being postponed and pushed back by months, leaving many applicants who travelled to India for visa stamping stranded.While the administration argues the new system will curb abuse and protect American workers, the combined effect of higher fees, wage-based selection and tighter vetting is likely to reshape the H-1B landscape, making it tougher for younger professionals to enter the US workforce and potentially pushing more work offshore.Supporters of the H-1B programme argue it is crucial for hiring healthcare professionals and educators, drives innovation, and supports economic growth in the US by filling specialised roles. Critics, however, claim the visas are often used for entry-level roles rather than highly specialised positions. They argue that companies can suppress wages by classifying jobs at lower skill levels, even when the hired workers have significant experience.","The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has announced a major overhaul of the visa selection process. H-1B visas will no longer be allocated purely by chance. Instead, registrations will be weighted based on wage levels set by the US Department of Labour (DOL) The new rule, released on Tuesday night, will take effect from February 27, 2026.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126158332,imgsize-39648,width-400,resizemode-4/.jpg"

Asian stock markets edged higher on Wednesday, rounding off a strong year driven largely by gains in AI-related stocks, while commodities such as gold and silver extended their rally to fresh record highs as 2025 comes to an end.Overnight in the United States, Wall Street ended on a positive note, with the S&P 500 closing at a record high as the long-awaited Santa Claus rally finally emerged. Investor sentiment was supported by data showing that the US economy expanded at a much faster pace than expected in the third quarter, as reported by Reuters.Gold and silver were among the biggest movers in early Asian trading. Spot gold rose 0.8% to a new all-time high of $4,524 per ounce, taking its gains for the year to around 72%. Silver jumped 1.2% to a record $72.27 per ounce and was on track for an annual rise of nearly 150%, marking its strongest yearly performance on record.Equity markets across Asia were modestly higher. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.3%, taking its gain for the year to about 26%, the index’s best annual performance since 2017. Japan’s Nikkei climbed 0.4% and was also up around 26% for the year, while South Korean stocks outperformed the region with a sharp surge of 72% in 2025.Global equity futures were largely flat amid thin year-end trading volumes, with EURO STOXX 50, Nasdaq and S&P 500 futures showing little movement.Market participants remained broadly positive about equities, despite persistent risks.“As equity markets enter the fourth year of a bull market, our underlying market call remains constructive,” said Scott Chronert, a US equity strategist at Citi.He added that while earnings growth and high valuations could support further gains, sharp differences in performance across sectors and market segments are likely.In currency markets, the Japanese yen strengthened for a third straight session amid concerns over possible intervention by Japanese authorities. The dollar slipped 0.3% to 155.78 yen, moving away from the 158 level that has previously triggered intervention. The euro was steady at $1.18 and has risen about 14% this year, while the dollar has fallen roughly 10% against major peers in 2025.In the bond market, US Treasuries have gained this year following the resumption of Federal Reserve rate cuts. The two-year Treasury yield was steady at 3.532%, down 72 basis points for the year, while the 10-year yield stood at 4.1589%, lower by about 42 basis points in 2025.Oil prices were little changed in early Asian trade but were set to end the year lower for a third consecutive year.

What is the $100,000 H-1B fee?

Which companies could be most affected?



A US federal judge upheld the Trump administration's move to move ahead with President Donald Trump's proposal to impose a $100,000 fee on new H-1B visas, dealing a setback to the American technology companies and business groups challenging the move.US District Judge Beryl Howell in Washington DC on Tuesday rejected a lawsuit filed by the Chamber of Commerce, which argued that the steep fee violated federal immigration law and would force companies, hospitals and other employers to cut jobs and services.Howell ruled that Trump had the legal authority to impose the fee, noting that his proclamation was issued under ""an express statutory grant of authority to the President.""""The parties’ vigorous ‌debate over the ultimate wisdom of this political judgment is not within the province of the courts,"" Howell wrote, Reuters reported.""So long as the actions dictated by the policy decision and articulated in the Proclamation fit within the confines of the law, the Proclamation must be upheld,"" she added.The Chamber of Commerce had argued that the president lacked the power to impose such a fee and warned it would hurt employers that rely on skilled foreign workers.Its executive vice president and chief counsel Daryl Joseffer said many small and medium-sized businesses would struggle to afford the cost. ""We are disappointed in ‍the court’s decision and are considering further legal options to ensure ‌that the H-1B visa program can operate as Congress intended,"" Joseffer said in a statement.The H-1B visa programme allows US employers to hire foreign workers in specialised fields and is widely used by technology companies. The programme issues 65,000 visas annually, with an additional 20,000 visas for workers with advanced degrees, typically valid for three to six years.Until now, H-1B visa fees generally ranged between $2,000 and $5,000, depending on various factors. Under Trump's order, however, the fee for new H-1B applications would jump sharply to $100,000.H-1B visas are allocated through a lottery system, though the programme mainly serves the tech sector. The US Department of Homeland Security has also moved to overhaul the selection process, replacing the random lottery with a system that favours higher-paid and more highly skilled foreign workers.The Trump administration says this change is aimed at protecting American wages and jobs.Companies such as Amazon, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Microsoft, Meta Platforms and Apple are among the largest users of H-1B visas, according to US government data cited by Bloomberg.Opponents of the policy argue that the higher fee would force employers to choose between significantly higher labour costs or hiring fewer highly skilled foreign workers. Separate legal challenges have also been filed by Democratic-led states and a coalition of employers, nonprofits and religious organisations.In issuing the order, Trump cited his authority under federal immigration law to restrict the entry of foreign nationals deemed detrimental to US interests.Judge Howell further stated that the administration had adequately supported its claim that the H-1B programme was displacing American workers, pointing to examples where companies laid off thousands of US employees while continuing to seek H-1B visas.","US District Judge Beryl Howell in Washington DC on Tuesday rejected a lawsuit filed by the Chamber of Commerce.

'American Lives At Risk, Economy Under Threat': Kristi Noem's Shocking House Homeland Testimony

The US economy expanded in the third quarter at the fastest pace in two years, bolstered by resilient consumer and business spending and calmer trade policies.Inflation-adjusted GDP, which measures the value of goods and services produced in the US, increased at a 4.3% annualised pace, a Bureau of Economic Analysis report showed on Tuesday. That was higher than all but one forecast in a Bloomberg survey and followed 3.8% growth in the prior period.The BEA was originally due to publish an advance estimate of GDP on Oct. 30, but the report was cancelled due to govt shutdown. The S& rose in early trading Tuesday, while Treasuries fell. The delayed report card shows the economy maintained momentum through the middle of the year as consumers powered ahead and the most punitive of Trump's tariffs were rolled back. While the shutdown is expected to weigh on fourth-quarter growth, economists expect a modest rebound in 2026.","Inflation-adjusted GDP increased at a 4.3% annualised pace.

JD Vance Insults India Over H1B Visa? 'Cheap, 3rd-World Labour' | U.S. VP For 'America First'

The US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has moved to overhaul the H-1B work visa selection process, replacing the long-standing random lottery with a system that gives preference to higher-paid and more highly skilled foreign workers, a shift the Trump administration states is aimed at protecting American wages and jobs.This rule, together with the imposition of the $ 100,000 entry-fee for new H-1B applications and the proposed hike in wages will make it more challenging for companies to recruit overseas employees under the H-1B visa program – this is not good news for those pursuing the American dream. On the flip side, this is expected to result in more offshoring – with countries like India, expected to benefit through expansion of global capability centres.This new rule, released on Tuesday night, will take effect from Feb 27, 2026 - it will be in place before the E-registrations for the coming H-1B cap applications open. There is an annual quota of 85,000 (including the Masters cap) for H-1B cap applications. E-registrations for H-1B applications open in March. As demand significantly exceeds supply, post registration a random lottery is conducted. The sponsoring employers then file a detailed H-1B application for those candidates (beneficiaries) who were successfully selected in the lottery.The random selection (lottery) mechanism will now stand changed. Under the new rule, H-1B visas will no longer be allocated purely by chance. Instead, registrations will be weighted according to wage levels set by the US Department of Labour (DOL), increasing the likelihood of selection for applicants offered higher salaries.In an official statement the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) contends that the existing lottery had been misused by some employers to bring in lower-paid foreign labour at the expense of US workers.“The existing random selection process of H-1B registrations was exploited and abused by US employers who were primarily seeking to import foreign workers at lower wages than they would pay American workers,” Matthew Tragesser, a spokesperson for USCIS, said in a statement. He added that the weighted system would better reflect congressional intent behind the programme and strengthen US competitiveness by encouraging employers to seek higher-skilled and higher-paid talent.The rule does not make substantial changes from draft rules that were released in Sept. TOI had done a deep dive into the mechanism set down in the draft rules and its implications. An H-1B candidate with a Level IV wage offer (the highest tier) would be entered into the lottery four times, while a Level III beneficiary would be entered three times, a Level II beneficiary twice, and a Level I beneficiary only once. This ‘weighted lottery’ approach would give higher odds of selection to those offered the highest wages.Under the current system, all beneficiaries (across all four levels) entered in the lottery face equal odds of selection of about 29.59%. Under the proposed rule, however, odds diverge sharply by wage level.The National Foundation for American Policy (NFAP), which had analysed the draft rules had stated that under the new mechanism, the probability of selecting an individual at Level IV for an H-1B application would increase by 107% but fall by 48% for individuals at Level I. Effectively, the rule would tilt opportunities heavily toward mid-career professionals or those in senior roles, while creating a barrier for entry-level professionals, including the bulk of recent international graduates from US universities.The implications for the Indian diaspora who aspire to work in the US at lower tiers – such as new graduates from US universities are stark. For the fiscal ended Sept 2024, of the 1.41 lakh H-1B applications approved by US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), 80,449 (or 57%) were for Indian beneficiaries. It should be noted that the total figure is above the annual quota of 85,000 as USCIS keeps a buffer for rejections or employers withdrawing from the process.USCIS added that this rule is another crucial step to strengthen the integrity of the H-1B visa program. “As part of the Trump Administration’s commitment to H-1B reform, we will continue to demand more from both employers and aliens so as not to undercut American workers and to put America first,” said Tragesser.","The US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has moved to overhaul the H-1B work visa selection process.

Pakistan PIA Privatisation: National airline PIA sold to private consortium; Rs 135 billion deal sealed,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/pakistan-national-airline-pia-sold-to-private-consortium-arif-habib-rs-135-billion-deal-sealed/articleshow/126144152.cms,"Representative image

Pakistan government on Tuesday sold its national airline, PIA, for Rs 135 billion to a consortium led by Arif Habib investment firm on Tuesday. The sale, organised through a bidding process in Islamabad, marks the largest transaction in Pakistan's history.It aims to revive the once-prestigious carrier that had been struggling due to years of mismanagement, as reported by PTI.There were three companies bidding for this auction, namely Arif Habib, Lucky Cement, and Airblue. Arif Habib won this auction after an aggressive bidding process against Lucky Cement. The successful auction cost of Rs 135 billion was much higher than the government's reference price of Rs 100 billion. Airblue has quoted the lowest amount, Rs 26.5 billion.The sale will involve 75% of the shares of PIA at this stage, and the successful bidder will have 90 days to purchase the rest 25%. A greater portion of the money accruing from the sale of the national carrier, 92.5%, will be invested in the airline, while the remaining 7.5% will be paid to the government.The deal requires Arif Habib to invest an additional Rs 80 billion in PIA over the next five years.This comes after the government took over the airline's massive debt of Rs 654 billion last year to make the sale more attractive.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif praised the transparent nature of the sale. ""It will be the largest transaction ever in Pakistan's history,"" he stated during a federal cabinet meeting.The entire bidding process was broadcast live on local TV channels. This successful sale came after a failed attempt last year when the airline didn't attract the desired price.PIA's privatization marks the end of an era for what was once a prominent airline. Years of poor management had severely impacted its service quality and reputation, ultimately forcing the government to sell it to private investors.","Pakistan government sold its national airline, PIA, for Rs 135 billion to a consortium led by Arif Habib investment firm on Tuesday.

'Economic golden age': Donald Trump hails Q3 GDP beat as proof of tariffs push; inflation and jobs data add caution,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/economic-golden-age-donald-trump-hails-q3-gdp-beat-as-proof-of-tariffs-push-inflation-and-jobs-data-add-caution/articleshow/126144571.cms,"US President Donald Trump on Tuesday seized on stronger-than-expected third-quarter growth to claim an “economic golden age,” arguing that tariffs and his tax policies were driving a sharp acceleration in activity even as official data pointed to lingering inflation pressures and a softening labour market.In a post on Truth Social, Trump said the US economy’s 4.3% annualised growth rate in the July–September quarter had “BLOWN PAST expectations” and credited his policies for the performance. “The SUCCESS is due to Good Government, and TARIFFS,” he wrote, adding that “Consumer spending is STRONG, Net Exports are WAY UP, Imports and Trade Deficits are WAY DOWN, and there is NO INFLATION.”He also claimed that investment was “SETTING RECORDS” because of his tax bill and tariffs, declaring that the “Trump Economic Golden Age is FULL steam ahead.”The Commerce Department’s data showed that gross domestic product expanded at a 4.3% annual rate in the third quarter, accelerating from 3.8% growth in the April–June period and comfortably beating forecasts of around 3%, according to analysts surveyed by FactSet. It was the first of three official estimates for the quarter, released after delays linked to the government shutdown.Growth was supported by robust consumer spending, exports and government outlays.Consumer spending, which accounts for roughly 70% of US economic activity, rose at a 3.5% annual pace, up from 2.5% in the previous quarter. Exports increased at an 8.8% rate, while imports fell 4.7%, providing a boost to headline GDP.A measure of the economy’s underlying strength — combining consumer spending and private investment while excluding volatile components such as inventories, trade and government spending — grew at a 3% annual rate, slightly higher than the 2.9% pace recorded in the second quarter.However, the growth report also showed that inflation remains above the Federal Reserve’s comfort zone. The Fed’s preferred inflation gauge, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index, rose at a 2.8% annual pace in the third quarter, up from 2.1% in the previous quarter. Core PCE inflation, which strips out food and energy prices, climbed to 2.9% from 2.6%.The labour market data has also been mixed. The government reported last week that the US economy added 64,000 jobs in November but lost 105,000 in October, while the unemployment rate rose to 4.6%, the highest level since 2021.Despite inflation staying above the Fed’s 2% target, the central bank cut its benchmark interest rate three times toward the end of 2025, citing concerns about slowing momentum in hiring.","US economy grew at 4.3% annualised rate in the July–September quarter.

US consumer confidence weakened in December, sliding to its lowest level since President Donald Trump rolled out sweeping tariffs earlier this year, as households grew more anxious about high prices, trade levies and job prospects, according to a survey by the Conference Board.The Conference Board said its consumer confidence index fell 3.8 points to 89.1 in December from an upwardly revised 92.9 in November, AP reported. The reading is close to the 85.7 level recorded in April, when the Trump administration introduced import taxes on key US trading partners, AP reported.Consumers’ assessment of current economic conditions saw a sharper drop. The present situation index fell 9.5 points to 116.8, reflecting growing unease about inflation and employment conditions. Write-in responses to the survey showed that prices and inflation remained the biggest concern for consumers, alongside tariffs.Short-term expectations for income, business conditions and the labour market were little changed at 70.7, but remained well below 80 — a threshold that can signal a recession ahead. This was the 11th straight month that expectations stayed under that level.Perceptions of the job market also weakened. The share of consumers who said jobs were “plentiful” fell to 26.7% in December from 28.2% in November, while those who said jobs were “hard to get” rose to 20.8% from 20.1%.The softer sentiment follows recent labour market data showing mixed signals. Government figures released last week showed the US economy added 64,000 jobs in November after losing 105,000 jobs in October. The unemployment rate climbed to 4.6% last month, its highest level since 2021.Economists say the labour market is stuck in a “low hire, low fire” phase, as companies remain cautious amid uncertainty over tariffs and the lingering effects of high interest rates. Since March, average monthly job creation has slowed to about 35,000, down from 71,000 in the year ended March. Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell has said he suspects those figures could be revised even lower, AP reported.","The Conference Board said its consumer confidence index fell 3.8 points to 89.1 in December.

Trump Immigration Offensive SHOCK Reveal; Workplace Raids, Expanded Detention Incoming Next Year

President Trump’s executive office – the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), is currently reviewing a rule submitted by the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS). This rule – ‘Weighted selection process for H-1B cap applications’, once approved and finalized will fundamentally alter the way H-1B visas are allocated.DHS intends to weigh the lottery based on salary levels tied to the Department of Labor’s (DOL) four-tier wage system – this would give those with a higher wage a better chance of being selected in the H-1B lottery. This move follows just days after the DOL sent a proposed rule to OMB for review, which sought to hike prevailing H-1B wages across all levels.Immigration attorneys are largely of the view that the weighted selection rule will be finalized and implemented before the next H-1B filing season. There is an annual quota of 85,000 for H-1B cap applications. E-registrations for H-1B applications open up in March. As demand significantly exceeds supply, post registration a random lottery is conducted. The sponsoring employers then file a detailed H-1B application for those candidates (beneficiaries) who were successfully selected in the lottery.This random selection mechanism will change.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

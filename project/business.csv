Hindenburg shutdown: Nate Anderson , founder of Hindenburg Research , announced on Wednesday the shut down of his US investment firm, stating they have completed all ongoing projects.The firm's investigations have resulted in substantial market value losses for several companies, notably including the Indian conglomerate Adani Group , which Hindenburg accused of engaging in ""brazen"" corporate fraud.Their most notable achievement involved exposing electric truck manufacturer Nikola in 2020, when they revealed misrepresentations about the company's technological capabilities.""The plan has been to wind up after we finished the pipeline of ideas we were working on,"" Anderson declared on Wednesday, adding, ""And as of the last Ponzi cases we just completed and are sharing with regulators, that day is today.""Also Read | 'Kitne Ghazi Aaye, Kitne Ghazi…’: Adani Group CFO shares cryptic post after Hindenburg Research announces shutdown Anderson noted that their investigations contributed to regulatory actions against approximately 100 individuals, including wealthy businesspeople and oligarchs, resulting in civil or criminal charges.The investment group derived its name from the notorious 1937 incident involving the German Hindenburg airship, which caught fire whilst arriving in New Jersey.According to an ET report, below are the 7 big cases where Hindenburg was involved:Throughout 2023, Hindenburg Research targeted the Adani Group with reports, causing significant financial impact on Gautam Adani's business empire. The group's market capitalisation experienced a dramatic decline following Hindenburg's allegations. Subsequently, the group recovered most of its stock market losses. The Adani Group has consistently rejected all accusations made by Hindenburg. According to a Wall Street Journal article, since the Hindenburg targeted the Adani Group, the Adani Enterprises stock has given negative returns.In 2024, Hindenburg levelled accusations against SEBI Chairperson Madhabi Puri Buch and her spouse Dhaval Buch, suggesting they had interests in offshore entities connected to alleged Adani money siphoning.The short-seller Hindenburg claimed that Nikola indulged in deceptive practices regarding its technological claims in 2020. They disputed the authenticity of Nikola's promotional video featuring their electric truck, revealing that the vehicle was simply allowed to roll downhill rather than operating under its own power.

Read full text of founder Nate Anderson’s personal note Hindenburg Research raised serious concerns about Icahn Enterprises LP's (IEP) financial reporting practices in 2023. They alleged that IEP had inflated its asset valuations and relied on a “Ponzi-like” structure to pay dividends. The allegations resulted in a significant decline in IEP's share value, reducing Carl Icahn's personal wealth by $2.9 billion to $14.7 billion, as reported by Forbes. IEP responded with a statement from Icahn, dismissing Hindenburg's report as ""self-serving"" and claiming it was intended to profit at the expense of long-term shareholders.In 2023, Hindenburg Research revealed short positions in Block Inc whilst claiming that the payment company, headed by Jack Dorsey of Twitter fame, had inflated user statistics and downplayed costs related to customer acquisition. This action directly confronted Dorsey, who established Block from his San Francisco flat in 2009, aiming to revolutionise credit card services. Block's response included potential legal proceedings against Hindenburg Research for publishing what Block termed a ""factually inaccurate and misleading report"" intended to manipulate investor perception.In 2022, Hindenburg initially took a short position followed by a long one in Twitter. In May, the firm announced its short position, speculating that Elon Musk's $44-billion private acquisition offer could face downward price revision if he withdrew from the agreement. By July, Anderson revealed a ""significant long position,"" effectively wagering against Musk's interests. The Twitter acquisition ultimately concluded in October at the initially proposed valuation.Hindenburg Research claimed to have uncovered financial fraud at J&J Purchasing, valued at $400 million, through covert surveillance recordings obtained in 2022. The recordings documented J&J representatives promoting deceptive investment opportunities, which prompted FBI involvement and led to a tense confrontation. Subsequently, the legal counsel orchestrating the fraud provided a full admission. The incident garnered substantial media coverage and led to criminal prosecution of the participants. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) initiated legal proceedings against J&J and its principal operators in 2022, effectively terminating the fraudulent operation.","Short-seller Hindenburg Research shut down on Wednesday.

Poll What Do You Think About Hindenburg Research Shutting Down? Surprising Decision After Major Revelations A Bold Move After a History of Impactful Reports

Why has Hindenburg Research shut down?

Below is the full text of his personal note:

As I’ve shared with family, friends and our team since late last year, I have made the decision to disband Hindenburg Research. The plan has been to wind up after we finished the pipeline of ideas we were working on. And as of the last Ponzi cases we just completed and are sharing with regulators, that day is today.

I write this from a place of joy. Building this has been a life’s dream.

I did not know at the outset if it would be possible to find a fulfilling path. This wasn’t an easy option, but I was naïve to the danger and felt drawn to it magnetically.

When I started this, I doubted I was capable. I didn’t have a traditional finance background. None of my relatives are in this field. I went to a state school. I’m not a slick salesperson. I don’t know any of the right clothes to wear. I can’t play golf. I’m not some superhuman that can function on 4 hours of sleep. In most of my jobs I was a good worker but mostly looked over. I had no money when I started—and after catching 3 lawsuits immediately out of the gate, I quickly had less than no money. I would have failed right at the starting line had it not been for the support of world-class whistleblower lawyer Bryan Wood, who took the cases on despite my lack of financial resources. I had a newborn child and was facing eviction at the time. I was terrified, but knew that if I stayed still I would crumble. The only option I had was to keep moving forward.

It is very easy to succumb to negative thoughts and believe what others think of you, especially when things feel low. But it is possible to shatter all of that. I was passionate about this and I let that carry me forward despite my fears and insecurities.

And then this slowly started to flourish.

One at a time, and without a clear plan, we built a team of 11 incredible people. I hired each of them not because we needed workers, but because when our paths crossed and I could see who they were, I realized it was madness not to bring them on.

They are all smart, focused, and fun to work with. Little to no ego. When you meet them, they are all very nice and polite. But when it comes to this field, they are ruthless assassins, capable of world-class work. Like me, our team didn’t come from traditional finance backgrounds. My first hire often describes himself as a former bartender. We all have a shared view of the world, a mostly calm exterior, and a similar burning underlying intensity. They are all family to me.

We have all worked extremely hard, with a focus on precision and letting the evidence dictate our words.

Sometimes this meant taking big swings and taking on fights that are much bigger than any of us as individuals. Fraud, corruption, and negativity often seem overwhelming. Early on, a sense of justice was usually elusive. When it happened, it was tremendously fulfilling. It kept us going when we needed it.

And boy did we have an impact, eventually—more than I imagined was possible at the outset. Nearly 100 individuals have been charged civilly or criminally by regulators at least in part through our work, including billionaires and oligarchs. We shook some empires that we felt needed shaking.

Over time, people began to see what I hoped we could show—that having an impact is possible, no matter who you are.

It has also been rather intense, and at times, all-encompassing. I often wake up from my dreams because I’ve thought of a new investigative thread to pull on in my sleep, or an edit that clarifies a point I didn’t realize I was troubled by during the day. Or from the general pressure of it all. We are not fearless—we just have faith in the truth and hope it leads us down the right path.

I’m grateful for all of it. We have days of bizarre, hilarious and ridiculous stories and we’ve had a lot of fun amidst the pressure and challenges. It has been the adventure of a lifetime.

So, why disband now? There is not one specific thing—no particular threat, no health issue, and no big personal issue.

Someone once told me that at a certain point a successful career becomes a selfish act. Early on, I felt I needed to prove some things to myself. I have now finally found some comfort with myself, probably for the first time in my life. I probably could have had it all along had I let myself, but I needed to put myself through a bit of hell first. The intensity and focus has come at the cost of missing a lot of the rest of the world and the people I care about. I now view Hindenburg as a chapter in my life, not a central thing that defines me.

Beyond my own desire for relief, it also feels selfish to keep the knowledge we’ve accumulated trapped within our small team. I have more than enough. In the past several years we’ve been flooded with thousands of messages from many of you asking how we do what we do, or whether you can join the team. I read them all and I’ve been trying to figure out how to respond in a way that can answer everyone—so over the next 6 months or so I plan to work on a series of materials and videos to open-source every aspect of our model and how we conduct our investigations.

My hope is that after we fully share our process, in a couple years I will get an unsolicited message from someone who reads this (maybe you), who embraces the same passion, learns the craft, and finds the confidence to shed some light on a subject that needs it, despite the obstacles in your way. That would make my day, even if I’m off trying to learn music or planting a garden or whatever I end up doing next.

For now, I will be focused on making sure everyone on our team lands where they want to be next. Some are going to start their own research firm, which I will strongly and publicly encourage, even as I will have no personal involvement. There are others on our team who are now free agents—so feel free to reach out to me if you have a need for anyone who is brilliant, focused, and easy to work with, as they all are.

It wasn’t always obvious to me, but I now view all of this as a love story. To my wife, you have been so patient with me. It has not been easy, to put it mildly, and I am forever grateful that you have sacrificed so much and pushed forward with me. And now, my dear, we get to enjoy it together for as long as this world will let us.

To my family and friends, I’m sorry for the times I have ignored you while I let my attention be drawn away. I can’t wait to have more time to share with you together.

Lastly, I want to express how grateful I am to our readers. Your messages of kindness and encouragement through the years have gone a long way to help give us the strength to continue. And it constantly reminds me that the world is filled with good. Thank you for all of it—I couldn’t ask for more. It is all a blessing.

With unfathomable levels of gratitude,

Nate Anderson","Hindenburg Research shut down after more than a year of work.

However, preferences differ sharply between electric four-wheelers (E4Ws) and electric two-wheelers (E2Ws). While E4W buyers value advanced technology, sophistication, and exclusivity, E2W consumers prioritise practicality, comfort, and affordability.Remarkably, women are becoming a driving force in the EV market, influencing 52 per cent of purchase decisions, up from 38 per cent in the internal combustion engine (ICE) segment.Emerging mobility models like electric, shared, and connected solutions are expected to generate an additional $100 billion, signalling a significant shift in consumer priorities.Vikram Janakiraman, managing director and senior partner at BCG, emphasised the importance of adapting to rapid changes in consumer demands.""Successful players will need to study and frequently adapt their product, solutions and experiences to suit these unique needs; Integrating Digital, Tech and AI will be critical to doing that,"" he said.Gen Z is emerging as a transformative force, with its members 2.7 times more likely to choose self-drive rentals compared to older generations. Self-drive rentals and subscription models are gaining traction, with 85 per cent of users expressing interest in purchasing the vehicles they rent.Meanwhile, digital purchase journeys are outpacing traditional methods, driven by a growing demand for personalisation.Bhaskar Ramesh, director of omni channel businesses at Google India said, ""From pre-purchase to in-vehicle experiences and after-sales services, we see immense potential for AI to deliver meaningful experiences and create real value for consumers. We're excited to collaborate with the industry to drive innovation and growth in this space.""The report also notes a shift in perceptions of used cars.

The company said the blade battery, developed by its technology partner, Chinese automaker BYD , cleared rigorous tests, including nail penetration, overcharging, and furnace trials, without any fire or explosion.“The blade battery is designed to withstand extreme climatic conditions and is much safer even when severely damaged during accidents. It is 30% lighter than traditional LFP batteries and provides 30% more energy storage, enabling these buses to travel up to 500 km on a single charge. Its compact and lightweight design improves space efficiency and vehicle stability. With a lifespan of over 5,000 charge cycles, it is durable and reliable,” Olectra Greentech said.According to the company, the blade battery is much cooler and more stable under stress compared to LFP batteries as it has very slow heat generation, low heat release, and non-oxygen release. It is also more compact, increasing space utilisation in the battery pack by over 50% compared to traditional battery packs, and can be packaged in the bus floor. By avoiding roof-mounted batteries, vehicle stability increases due to a lower centre of gravity.Olectra Greentech Chairman and Managing Director KV Pradeep said that even as the company has adopted the blade battery technology, it is looking for newer ways to improve, innovate, and push the boundaries of what is possible in the electric mobility industry. “Our focus continues on increasing our manufacturing and enhancing our technology capabilities,” he said.Olectra, which secured the world’s largest electric bus order for 5,150 buses from MSRTC, Maharashtra, also makes electric tippers that are used in industries like construction, roadwork, and mining.

The report finds evidence of ""symmetric effects of purchases and sales"" and notes that interventions follow a ""leaning against the wind"" strategy, wherein the central bank steps in to moderate large swings in the currency.The report, authored by Michael Patra, who retired this week, along with Sunil Kumar, Joice John, and Amarendra Acharya, highlights that foreign exchange intervention is a critical policy tool to manage volatility and prevent contagion risks.

He said,""Saif Ali Khan is better now. We made him walk, and he walked well. Looking at his parameters, his wounds and all the other injuries, he is safe to be shifted out of the ICU. He has to take several precautions. He has to take rest and his movement has been restricted for a week.""Dr Uttamani said that he was the doctor who met Saif within the first hour of his injury. He said, ""He had blood all over. But he walked in like a lion with his young child. He is a real hero.

Police are leveraging their network of informants and scrutinising CCTV footage from the building, which showed the assailant fleeing after the attack.Mumbai Police earlier disclosed that Saif’s residence lacked surveillance cameras, leaving investigators reliant on footage from the building’s common areas. The suspect’s image was captured on CCTV as he fled via a fire escape. Authorities suspect he entered through a duct, as there were no signs of forced entry.Philip, a house help employed by the family, recounted the terrifying ordeal.

State senator arrested at Georgia Capitol | FOX 5 News

Georgia State Senator Colton Moore was arrested on Thursday after an altercation while attempting to enter the State House chamber.Moore was barred from the chamber last year after criticising the state Senate’s decision to honour the late former Speaker David Ralston by naming a university building after him.During his fiery remarks last year, Moore had called Ralston “one of the most corrupt Georgia leaders”, leading to his suspension from chamber entry, according to Fox News.On Wednesday, Moore sent a letter to current House Speaker Jon Burns, calling the ban unconstitutional. “I will NEVER back down,” he wrote on social media platform X, sharing the letter. “I will ALWAYS speak the truth and represent the people of Northwest Georgia as their trusted America First Senator.”On Thursday, when Moore tried to enter the chamber during a joint session, he was blocked by a doorman. The video footage showed Moore being pushed back, resulting in a scuffle. He was later seen on the ground, surrounded by state troopers, and was subsequently arrested.According to Fox News, Moore insisted he had a constitutional right to enter the chamber, claiming, “Your House rules do not apply. I’m going into the chamber.”Republicans have expressed disappointment including Georgia Republican Party Chairman Josh McKoon who said he was “shocked” by Moore’s arrest.This isn’t the first controversy surrounding Moore. In 2023, he was suspended by the Republican Senate Caucus for criticising colleagues who opposed his efforts to impeach Fani Willis, the prosecutor who indicted Donald Trump in an election interference case.","Georgia State Senator Colton Moore was arrested on Thursday after an altercation while attempting to enter the State House chamber.

For next year, the World Bank has estimated growth to be at 6.7%. India will still retain the tag of fastest growing major economy in the world, against the backdrop of geopolitical tensions and global policy uncertainty .Several multilateral agencies have revised their growth estimates downwards for India after the National Statistics Office's (NSO) projection showed the economy is expected to expand by 6.4% - the lowest in four years in the current financial year, and sharply below the 8.2% recorded in 2023-24.The sharp slowdown in growth has triggered calls for measures to boost consumption, which some experts say have been hit by stubborn inflationary pressures. Pressures have mounted on the Reserve Bank of India to cut rates to boost growth. The budget is expected to unveil measures to step up growth, amid the backdrop of an uncertain global economy.

The aim is to shore up China's own production, reduce any potential job cuts, and prevent foreign investors from fleeing the country if the US imposes new trade barriers, the person said.Apple's main assembly partner Foxconn hasn't been able to dispatch its Chinese staff to India and its factory in the country hasn't been able to receive additional specialised machinery from China, some of the people said. There's been no immediate impact on production though, they said.China's ministry of foreign affairs said in a statement on Friday the nation ""treats all countries equally and is open to enterprises"" from everywhere. ""China has never done anything that harms interests of other nations to the detriment of itself,"" according to the statement.

Foxconn's assembly plant in Chennai accounts for about half of the country's iPhone exports, although the company still makes the bulk of Apple handsets in central China.Beijing doesn't want Foxconn to further diversify its production away to other regions, one of the people said. Foxconn employs hundreds of thousands of workers at its Chinese factories, and its large operations are key to local electronics supply chain as well as employment.Rest of World and Nikkei Asia had earlier reported on the Chinese curbs. While the trend of foreign companies shifting away from China started already several years ago, during Trump's first term, the exodus is set to intensify now and could include more technology companies, said Woods Chen, chief economist at Yuanta Securities in Taipei.The restrictions on tech equipment have also had an impact on manufacturing of electric vehicles and solar panels in India, the people said, with the Indian unit of Chinese EV maker BYD and Waaree Energies, India's largest solar-panel maker, affected.BYD's public relations staff and Waaree didn't immediately respond to messages seeking further information.

Critics called these suggestions an outcome of an exploitative and outdated mindset.The backlash, however, highlights a broader tension in corporate environments between constructive corporate patriotism and blind corporate jingoism .While corporate patriots strive for organisational success by addressing flaws and fostering sustainable growth, corporate jingoists demand unwavering loyalty and relentless work, often disregarding employee well-being and work-life balance. Subrahmanyan’s remarks have ignited discussions about the fine line between dedication to professional excellence and the risk of promoting a culture of burnout and overwork.Jingoism and nationalism, though often conflated, reflect fundamentally different attitudes toward loyalty and identity. Nationalism is a sense of pride and devotion to one’s country, tempered by a broader understanding of its flaws and a desire to improve it. It is grounded in constructive commitment—a belief in the collective good and a willingness to contribute to its advancement. Jingoism, in contrast, is an extreme, often blind allegiance to one’s nation, marked by an unwavering belief in its superiority and infallibility. Jingoists view criticism as disloyalty and often adopt a combative stance toward dissent, fostering an environment of us-versus-them.In the corporate world, these paradigms manifest as corporate jingoists and corporate patriots. Corporate patriots (akin to nationalists) believe in their company’s mission and work to make it better, while acknowledging its flaws and striving for sustainable growth. They are loyal but critical thinkers, engaging with challenges to help the organization evolve. Corporate jingoists, however, see their company as a monolithic entity that can do no wrong. For them, the company is a near-sacred institution deserving of unquestioning allegiance, and their identity is inextricably tied to its success and dominance.While most employees in a company will view their job as a transactional engagement, a minority of corporate jingoists and patriots at senior levels can serve as anchors for the organization’s culture and vision. Corporate jingoists are particularly well-suited to the role of CEO or other cult-like leadership positions. Their unshakable belief in the company’s greatness inspires loyalty, drives bold decision-making, and creates a unifying narrative that galvanizes teams. These leaders embody the company, living and breathing its values with a fervor that transforms them into symbolic figures. Corporate patriots, on the other hand, often populate other senior roles, ensuring that the vision of the jingoistic CEO is tempered by pragmatism and a drive for sustainable progress.For the broader employee base, this leadership dynamic provides a choice. As they traverse their career paths—often moving between companies every few years—they can decide how deeply they want to engage. They may choose to adopt the passion of a corporate nationalist, commit fully as a jingoist, or treat their role as a stepping stone, viewing the company as just another employer. Each choice is valid, but it is the visibility of jingoistic leadership that serves as a litmus test for potential allegiance. By showcasing such passionate devotion at the top, companies provide employees the opportunity to reflect on their own alignment with the organization’s culture and values.This balance between jingoists and patriots at senior levels, coupled with the freedom of the rank and file to decide their own level of engagement, creates a healthy organizational ecosystem. The jingoist CEO ensures the company’s identity remains strong and uncompromising, while corporate patriots and rank-and-file pragmatists provide the critical thinking and operational flexibility necessary for sustained success. Together, they form a dynamic system that allows companies to cultivate loyalty where it matters most, while leaving room for individual autonomy and career mobility.","The debate over work-life balance scaled up after L&T chairman SN Subrahmanyan proposed a 90-hour work week, including working on Sundays.

"Hindenburg, which dealt Adani a $140bn m-cap blow, to disband",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/hindenburg-which-dealt-adani-a-140bn-m-cap-blow-to-disband/articleshow/117313260.cms,"Poll What’s Your Opinion on Major Financial Reports and Their Impact on the Market? They Often Create Unnecessary Panic They Provide Valuable Insights for Investors

Shook some empires that needed shaking, says Hindenburg founder

MUMBAI: Hindenburg Research , the US-based short-seller whose reports had shaved off about $140 billion from Adani Group 's market valuation in early 2023, pushed the Indian govt and markets regulator Sebi on the backfoot, and left Indian investors divided whether to support it or oppose, is winding down. Calling Adani's businesses ""the largest con in corporate history"", Hindenburg had alleged corporate malfeasance including stock price manipulation, cooking its books and other frauds.The group had denied all the allegations.Hindenburg had also targeted Sebi chief Madhabi Puri Buch and her husband Dhaval, alleging the duo of investing in the same offshore funds that the Adani Group had used to manipulate their stock prices. The couple had denied those allegations.Announcing the decision on Wednesday night, founder Nate Anderson said he viewed ""Hindenburg as a chapter"" in his life, and ""not a central thing"" that defined him.In Nov 2024, Adani and some of his associates were indicted by two US govt arms. The US department of justice and the Securities Exchange Commission alleged that Adani Group executives and their associates had committed wire frauds and misled investors as the conglomerate was paying about $220 million to Indian govt officials to win business.Over the next six months, Anderson said he would be working to release articles and videos to open-source how the team went about their business of investigating corporate frauds, corruption and malfeasance across the world. Since its founding in 2017, ""nearly 100 individuals have been charged civilly or criminally by regulators at least in part through our work, including billionaires and oligarchs. We shook some empires that we felt needed shaking,"" Anderson said in his note.Almost two years to the date, Hindenburg had released a 110-page report on the Adani Group alleging various types of corporate malfeasance. Following the report's release, over the next five weeks, about $140 billion worth of the group's market value was lost. As a result, as the net worth of Gautam Adani , the group's chairman, fell, his ranking in the Forbes billionaire list went down from third richest in the world to out of the top 25th.Last Aug, Hindenburg had released a report against the Sebi chief. ""We find it unsurprising that Sebi was reluctant to follow a trail (in the Adani affair) that may have led to its own chairperson,"" the Hindenburg report said.After the report was published, several opposition lawmakers demanded Sebi chief Buch's resignation while the BJP-led governing coalition at the Centre backed her.In Nov 2024, Adani and some of his associates were indicted by two US govt arms. The US department of justice and the Securities Exchange Commission alleged that Adani Group executives and their associates had committed wire frauds and misled investors as the conglomerate was paying about $220 million to Indian govt officials to win business.

US could cut interest rates 3 or 4 times this year: Fed official,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-could-cut-interest-rates-3-or-4-times-this-year-fed-official/articleshow/117308440.cms,"Tariff inflation shock unlikely

The US Federal Reserve could cut rates three or four times this year if inflation data cooperates, with a first cut possible before July, a senior bank official said Thursday.Headline consumer inflation rose for a third straight month in December as energy prices jumped, according to data published Wednesday, but a widely watched measure eased slightly, raising hopes that underlying inflation may be moderating.""The inflation that we got yesterday was very good,"" Fed governor Christopher Waller told CNBC, noting that underlying price pressures excluding volatile food and energy costs had been close to target on a monthly basis.The US central bank has been paring back interest rates in recent months, cutting by a full percentage point since September to bolster the labor market.But in recent months, headline inflation has ticked higher, raising concerns that the Fed may have to pause further cuts throughout much of 2025.At the most recent rate decision in December, Fed policymakers voted to cut rates by a quarter percentage-point to between 4.25 and 4.50, and penciled in just two rate cuts this year.Waller, who is a permanent voting member of the Fed's rate-setting committee told CNBC that he could support lowering rates as many as four times this year, depending on the data.""I may be a little more optimistic about inflation coming down than the rest of my colleagues,"" he said, adding that if the data didn't ""cooperate"", the Fed may be back to cutting just once or twice this year.Asked about the timing of cuts, Waller said if the data came in as he expected, it was ""reasonable"" to think rate cuts could come in the first half of the year.He also refused to rule out supporting a cut as soon as the Fed's March rate decision, if the data supported it.""I can certainly see rate cuts happening sooner than maybe the markets are pricing in,"" he said.Futures traders assign a roughly 70 percent chance that the Fed will remain on pause through the March rate decision, and a roughly 80 percent probability of no more than two cuts this year, according to data from CME Group.Waller was also asked about the likely impact of President-elect Donald Trump's tariff proposals, which included threats to impose sweeping tariffs of as much as 20 percent on all goods entering the United States.Many economists have said these policies could push up prices, at least in the short term, while Trump and his allies have either dismissed these concerns, or insisted that any pressures would be counteracted by other policies, including energy deregulation.""I don't think tariffs are going to have a significant impact or persistent effect on inflation,"" Waller said. ""But we'll just have to wait and see what happens.""He said most of the analysts on Wall Street estimate that Trump's tariff plans would have ""some marginal effect and short-lived effect on prices,"" but that it would not lead to ""persistent"" inflation.","US Federal Reserve could cut rates three or four times this year if inflation data cooperates, a senior bank official says.

This marked the lowest number since February last year.The four-week moving average, which smooths out weekly volatility, dipped slightly by 750 to 212,750, indicating stability.Meanwhile, the overall figure of Americans receiving unemployment benefits for the week ending 4 January fell by 18,000 to 1.86 million.Weekly jobless claims serve as a key indicator of layoffs, and despite this rise, the broader labour market remains strong.In December, the labour department reported a surge in job growth, with employers adding 256,000 positions. The unemployment rate also ticked down to 4.1 per cent, reflecting sustained hiring momentum.The final job reports of 2024 showcase that the US economy appears to be shifting into a post-pandemic phase characterised by steady growth, elevated borrowing costs, low unemployment, and moderately higher inflation.In another positive sign, the government reported that US job openings rose unexpectedly in November to 8.1 million, up from 7.8 million in October, marking the highest figure since February. This suggests that companies remain eager to hire, even as the labour market shows signs of loosening.Though layoffs fall into a healthy category by historical standards, several high-profile companies have followed the job-cutting trend in the past few months.This week, Meta, Facebook’s parent company, revealed plans to cut 5 per cent of its workforce, while Jack Daniel’s maker, Brown-Forman, announced a 12 per cent reduction in its global staff.Earlier, late in 2024, corporate giants such as GM, Boeing, Cargill, and Stellantis also revealed their plans for job cuts. Despite these isolated announcements, layoffs overall remain low by historical standards, underscoring the resilience of the US job market .This labour market data might be used by the federal reserve to guide its monetary policy decisions, with less pressure to reduce interest rates further in the near future.","Jobless benefits applications increased by 14,000 to 203,000 in the week ending 11 January.

US core inflation eases for first time in six months,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-core-inflation-eases-for-first-time-in-six-months/articleshow/117270847.cms,"PCE Prices



US consumer prices rose in December by less than forecast after months of faster underlying inflation persuaded the Federal Reserve to signal a pause in interest-rate cuts.The so-called core consumer price index — which excludes food and energy costs — increased 0.2% after rising 0.3% four straight months, Bureau of Labor Statistics figures showed Wednesday. Cheaper hotel stays, a smaller advance in medical care services and relatively tame rent increases helped restrain the December figure.While the easing in the CPI is welcome, Fed officials would need to see a series of subdued readings after months of elevated prints to reassure them that inflation progress has resumed. Lingering price pressures have contributed to a deep selloff in global bond markets and fueled concerns that the Fed eased policy too quickly at the end of last year.Combined with last week’s strong jobs report, policymakers are widely expected to leave rates unchanged at their meeting later this month, and traders generally don’t see another cut until later this year.Treasury yields slid and S&P 500 index futures rose while the dollar declined after the CPI data.Economists see the core gauge as a better indicator of the underlying inflation trend than the overall CPI that includes often-volatile food and energy costs. The headline measure rose 0.4% from the prior month, with over 40% of the advance due to energy.This is the last inflation report of President Joe Biden’s tenure, an administration dogged by high prices coming out of the pandemic that surged a cumulative 20% while he was in office. Donald Trump will be sworn in next week, and economists generally anticipate his policies — particularly on tariffs — will put upward pressure on inflation, and measures of consumers’ expectations have been rising recently as well.The advance in the CPI was also led by food prices, airfares, new and used cars, auto insurance and medical care. Goods costs excluding food and energy rose a smaller 0.1% after a 0.3% November increase. Also taking out used cars, goods prices fell.Shelter prices, the largest category within services, climbed 0.3% in December for a second month. Owners’ equivalent rent as well as rent of primary residence — subsets of shelter — both ticked up following the smallest gains since 2021.Excluding housing and energy, service prices rose 0.2%, the smallest increase since July, according to Bloomberg calculations. While central bankers have stressed the importance of looking at such a metric when assessing the overall inflation trajectory, they compute it based on a separate index.That measure — known as the personal consumption expenditures price index — doesn’t put as much weight on shelter as the CPI, which is one reason why it’s trending closer to the Fed’s 2% target. Several categories that feed through to the PCE from the producer price index, a measure of wholesale inflation that was released Tuesday, were mostly tame. However, the PPI’s gauge of airfares picked up notably.Policymakers also pay close attention to wage growth, as it can help inform expectations for consumer spending — the main engine of the economy. A separate report Wednesday that combines the inflation figures with recent wage data showed real hourly earnings grew 1% from a year ago, the smallest annual advance since July.While data on retail sales, inflation expectations and the housing market will be released in the next two weeks, this is the last major economic report Fed officials will see before their Jan. 28-29 meeting.Recent speeches and forecasts have indicated policymakers are still wary of upside risks to inflation and that they prefer a cautious approach to adjusting rates.","Consumer prices rose in December by less than forecast after months of faster underlying inflation. Cheaper hotel stays, a smaller advance in medical care services and relatively tame rent increases helped restrain the December figure. The advance in the CPI was also led by food prices, airfares, new and used cars, auto insurance and medical care.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117270854,imgsize-1635588,width-400,resizemode-4/117270854.jpg"
"Meta Layoffs 2025: Meta to lay off 3,600 employees; have decided to raise the bar, says Mark Zuckerberg",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/meta-to-lay-off-3600-employees-have-decided-to-raise-the-bar-says-mark-zuckerberg/articleshow/117250424.cms,"Poll How Do You Feel About Large-Scale Layoffs in the Tech Industry? Understandable Due to Economic Pressures Concerned About Job Security

Meta , the parent company of Facebook , Instagram, and WhatsApp, is set to lay off approximately 3,600 employees identified as low performers, according to an internal memo first reported by Bloomberg. CEO Mark Zuckerberg confirmed the move in the memo, describing it as a strategy to “raise the bar on performance management and move out low-performers faster.”The layoffs, affecting about 5% of Meta’s 72,400-strong workforce as of September, are part of what Zuckerberg called an “intense year” for the company.Employees in the United States will be notified of their status by February 10, with international employees to be informed later, AFP reported.“We typically manage out people who aren’t meeting expectations over the course of a year,” Zuckerberg stated, “but now we’re going to do more extensive performance-based cuts during this cycle.” He noted that some employees who underperformed in the last period may be retained if there is optimism about their future contributions. Those laid off will receive “generous severance,” the CEO added.The company plans to replace the outgoing employees with new hires later this year.This is not Meta’s first wave of job cuts. The company laid off over 11,000 employees in November 2022 and cut an additional 10,000 jobs in subsequent months.The announcement follows a series of policy shifts at Meta, including the elimination of its US fact-checking program, which had been criticised by conservatives as censorship. Zuckerberg also unveiled changes to content moderation policies, easing restrictions on divisive topics such as immigration and gender while loosening rules on hate speech.Last week, Meta also announced reductions to its diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) team and scaled back related programs. The policy changes have drawn praise from Republican figures and criticism from Democrats, with some accusing Zuckerberg of aligning with conservative ideas ahead of President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration on January 20.Meanwhile, Zuckerberg speaking on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast last week, revealed that Meta and other leading tech companies are developing AI systems capable of handling complex coding tasks currently performed by human engineers.He announced plans to replace midlevel software engineers with artificial intelligence by 2025, signaling a major shift in how the tech giant approaches software development.Meta’s shares fell Tuesday following the layoff news, reflecting investor concerns over the company's broader direction.","Meta, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, is set to lay off approximately 3,600 employees identified as low performers.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

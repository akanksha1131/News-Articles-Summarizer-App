Stock market today: Indian equity benchmarks, Nifty50 and BSE Sensex , opened flat in trade on Tuesday on weak global cues. While Nifty50 was above 25,550, BSE Sensex was just above 83,200. At 9:16 AM, Nifty50 was trading at 25,573.05, down 12 points or 0.049%. BSE Sensex was at 83,204.62, down 42 points or 0.050%.Analysts expect the stock market to remain range-bound in the near term, with investors closely tracking global cues and the ongoing corporate earnings season. Analysts have cautioned that any escalation in geopolitical tensions could weigh on sentiment.Dr. VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Investments Limited says, “The volatility in the market is likely to continue in the near-term till some clarity emerges regarding the US- Europe standoff on Greenland tariffs. Since both sides have hardened their positions, the uncertainty will continue for some time. A new development is likely today if the US Supreme Court ruling on Trump tariffs goes against President Trump. But there is no certainty on whether the ruling will happen today. If it does, the ruling might change the scenario completely overnight.From the fundamental perspective, there are good news as well as not so good news for the market.The good news is that the IMF has raised India’s FY 26 GDP growth rate to 7.3% confirming the robust performance of the economy despite many headwinds. An area of concern is that early Q3 results do not indicate a recovery in earnings growth. This is likely to change when the results of auto companies start flowing in since this sector has done well in Q3 and it is heartening that the growth momentum is continuing in the sector. ”“Geopolitical and geoeconomic issues will continue to dominate in the near-term and will influence the direction of the market. Investors can watch the developments and continue to follow a policy of nibbling at high quality stocks on declines.""Asian equities opened lower on Tuesday as renewed tariff threats by US President Donald Trump linked to Greenland revived trade concerns, dampening risk appetite across regional markets. The cautious tone spilled over into currency and bond markets, with the dollar sliding to a one-week low in early trade amid a broad selloff in US equities and government bonds following fresh warnings from the White House directed at the European Union.On the domestic front, foreign portfolio investors continued to pare exposure, selling shares worth Rs 3,263 crore on Monday. Domestic institutional investors, however, provided some support to the market, emerging as net buyers to the tune of Rs 4,234 crore.","Nifty50 was trading at 25,573.05, down 12 points or 0.049%.

'NATO Unbeatable, Tariffs A Mistake': Meloni BREAKS Ranks With Trump On Greenland | WATCH

US stock futures fell on Monday as markets reacted to President Donald Trump’s threat to impose additional tariffs on eight European countries. This comes after Washington has demanded to purchase Greenland, a move that has fuelled fears of a wider transatlantic trade conflict.S&P 500 futures slid about 0.7%, while Nasdaq futures fell 1.0% in thin trading, as US equity and bond markets were closed for a holiday. The dollar weakened against traditional safe-haven currencies, slipping against the Japanese yen and the Swiss franc, according to Reuters.Gold and silver climbed to record highs as investors sought safety, while oil prices eased amid concerns that an escalating trade dispute between the United States and Europe could hurt global growth and demand.In Europe, market sentiment was also weaker. EUROSTOXX 50 and Germany’s DAX futures were both down 1.1%. In Asia, Japan’s Nikkei index fell 1.0%, while MSCI’s broad index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan edged 0.1% lower.Trump said that he would impose additional 10% import tariffs from February 1 on goods from Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Finland and Britain. He added that the duties would rise to 25% from June 1 if no agreement is reached.Major European Union countries condemned the tariff threat, describing it as an attempt at economic coercion linked to Greenland.EU options include retaliatory tariffs on €93 billion ($108 billion) worth of US imports, which were approved last year but suspended for six months in early August, as well as steps under the bloc’s Anti-Coercion Instrument. The latter could target the US services trade or investments.Analysts at Deutsche Bank said European countries hold around $8 trillion in US bonds and equities, nearly twice as much as the rest of the world combined, and could consider repatriating some of those investments.“With the US net international investment position ⁠at record negative extremes, the mutual interdependence of European-US financial markets has never been higher,” said George Saravelos, the bank’s global head of foreign exchange research.He warned that using capital flows as leverage would be far more disruptive to markets than tariffs alone.The standoff is also expected to overshadow discussions at the World Economic Forum in Davos this week, where leaders from around the world will gather, including a large US delegation led by Trump.In Asia, investors were awaiting Chinese economic data due later on Monday, with growth expected to slow to 4.4% in the December quarter from 4.8% previously, as weak domestic demand offsets strength in exports and manufacturing.Attention is also on the Bank of Japan’s policy meeting on Friday. While no interest rate hike is expected, policymakers may signal a possible tightening as early as April. Political uncertainty is adding to the backdrop, with Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi expected to dissolve parliament ahead of a February election.In the United States, delayed data on core inflation and consumer spending for November, due on Thursday, are likely to shape expectations on when the Federal Reserve might cut interest rates again. Strong recent economic data have led markets to push back expectations for easing until at least June.Corporate earnings remain in focus, with results due this week from companies including Netflix, Johnson & Johnson, General Electric and Intel, alongside major banks.In currency markets, the euro rose 0.1% to $1.1613 after an early dip, while sterling edged up to $1.3387. The dollar fell 0.2% against the Swiss franc and 0.3% against the yen.US Treasury cash markets were closed, but 10-year futures edged higher as investors looked for safety. Gold climbed 1.5% to $4,664 an ounce.Oil prices slipped, with Brent crude down 0.5% at $63.84 a barrel and US crude off 0.4% at $59.18. Traders also remained cautious amid concerns over rising tensions in the Middle East, as a US Navy aircraft carrier group is expected to arrive in the Persian Gulf this week.","S&P 500 futures slid about 0.7%, while Nasdaq futures fell 1.0%.

Trump's Greenland gambit: EU leaders to meet in Brussels after US announces 10% tariffs — what’s on agenda,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/trumps-greenland-gambit-eu-leaders-to-meet-in-brussels-after-us-announces-10-tariffs-whats-on-agenda/articleshow/126665956.cms,"Donald Trump (AP image)

'NATO Unbeatable, Tariffs A Mistake': Meloni BREAKS Ranks With Trump On Greenland | WATCH

European Union leaders will hold an emergency meeting in Brussels on Thursday to decide how to respond to US President Donald Trump’s threat to impose new tariffs on several European countries.EU ambassadors met on Sunday and broadly agreed on a bilateral approach. This includes intensifying diplomatic efforts to discourage Washington from proceeding with the tariffs, while preparing retaliatory measures if the duties are imposed, EU diplomats said, according to Reuters.Trump on Saturday said that he would introduce a new wave of tariffs from February 1 on Denmark, Sweden, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Finland, Britain and Norway. He called the move necessary until the United States is allowed to buy Greenland.European leaders sharply criticized the move, describing the threat as coercive and unacceptable.At Thursday’s emergency summit, EU leaders are expected to discuss two main options. The first is a previously approved package of retaliatory tariffs on €93 billion ($108 billion) worth of US imports.These measures were suspended for six months after the EU and the US reached a limited trade agreement last year; however, could automatically come into force from February 6 if no solution is found.The second option is the EU’s “Anti-Coercion Instrument” (ACI), a powerful but so far unused tool that would allow the bloc to restrict access to public procurement, investment, banking activity or trade in services.The United States runs a surplus with the EU in services, including digital services, making this a potentially significant step. EU sources said support for immediate use of the ACI remains mixed, with broader backing for tariffs as a first response.European Council President Antonio Costa, in a social media post, said that the consultations with member states showed strong unity in support of Denmark and Greenland and a shared readiness to defend against “any form of coercion,” according to Bloomberg.Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen echoed that stance, saying Europe would not be blackmailed, while also welcoming the solidarity shown by other EU capitals.Denmark, however, has stressed the need to keep diplomatic channels open. Danish Foreign Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen said Copenhagen would continue to focus on dialogue, pointing to a working group set up last week involving Denmark, Greenland and the United States.“The US is also more than the U.S. president. I've just been there. There are also checks and balances in American society,” he said.Diplomacy is also expected to feature prominently at the World Economic Forum in Davos, where Trump is due to deliver a keynote address on Wednesday, his first appearance at the event in six years.“All options are on the table,” one EU diplomat said, summarising the bloc’s approach as talks in Davos followed by leaders meeting in Brussels.The eight countries targeted by the tariff threat are already subject to US duties of 10% to 15%. They issued a joint statement on Sunday warning that tariff threats undermine transatlantic relations and risk a “dangerous downward spiral”. The statement said they were ready to engage in dialogue, based on respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity.Views within the EU remain divided on how hard a line to take. A source close to French President Emmanuel Macron said he favours activating the ACI.Irish Prime Minister Micheál Martin said retaliation was inevitable if tariffs were imposed but cautioned it was “a bit premature” to deploy the new instrument.Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni called the tariff threat a mistake and said she had raised her concerns directly with him.In Britain, Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy said allies should work with the United States to resolve the dispute and avoid escalating rhetoric, stressing that London’s position on Greenland was non-negotiable.The tariff threat has also cast doubt on recent trade arrangements. The European Parliament is expected to suspend work on approving the EU-US trade deal, which was due to be voted on later this month. Lawmakers from major political groups said approval was not possible under the current circumstances.Markets reacted nervously to the developments, with the euro and sterling falling against the dollar and analysts warning of renewed volatility if the standoff deepens.","EU leaders will hold an emergency meeting in Brussels on Thursday to decide how to respond to US President Donald Trump’s threat to impose new tariffs on several European countries.

US–EU tariff standoff: Treasury chief Scott Bessent warns Europe against Greenland retaliation; dismisses Nobel link as 'canard',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/useu-tariff-standoff-treasury-chief-scott-bessent-warns-europe-against-greenland-retaliation-dismisses-nobel-link-as-canard/articleshow/126699246.cms,"The US has cautioned European countries against retaliatory tariffs linked to President Donald Trump’s threatened levies over Greenland, with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent describing such a response as ill-advised.Speaking to reporters on the opening day of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Bessent said any retaliatory move by Europe would be “very unwise”, according to an AFP report.Asked about reports that Trump, in a message to Norway’s prime minister, appeared to link his bid to control Greenland with not having won the Nobel Peace Prize, Bessent said he was unaware of any such correspondence.“I don’t know anything about the president’s letter to Norway,” he told reporters on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos. He added, however, “I think it’s a complete canard that the president will be doing this because of the Nobel Prize.”Trump said over the weekend that from February 1, a group of European countries — Britain, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden — would face a 10 per cent tariff on all goods exported to the United States. The tariffs, he said, would remain in place until Denmark agrees to cede Greenland.The announcement has triggered sharp reactions across Europe, with several US allies accusing Washington of economic coercion. German Vice Chancellor Lars Klingbeil said on Monday that Europe was preparing countermeasures in response to the proposed tariffs.Bessent cautioned European governments against escalating the dispute, reiterating his earlier warning that retaliatory tariffs would be “very unwise”. He said Trump viewed Greenland as a strategic asset vital to US security interests, arguing that Washington would not “outsource” its hemispheric security.Bessent said Trump’s interest in Greenland stems from its strategic importance. The US president views the autonomous Danish territory as a critical asset for national and hemispheric security, he said.“We are not going to outsource our hemispheric security to anyone else,” Bessent said, explaining Washington’s stance amid rising transatlantic trade tensions.Trump had for months insisted that the US should control Greenland, a position that has unsettled European Union capitals and raised the prospect of a fresh tariff confrontation between Washington and Europe.","US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent says any retaliatory move by Europe would be “very unwise” Trump said over the weekend that from February 1, a group of European countries would face a 10 per cent tariff on all goods exported to the United States.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126699405,imgsize-724668,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

Europe’s $108 Billion ’Strike’ To Decimate Trump's Tariffs, EU Action Shocks Washington

Cryptocurrencies fell sharply on Monday as US President Donald Trump ’s threat to impose new tariffs on eight European countries rattled risk assets and boosted demand for safe-haven assets. Bitcoin slid 3.6% to below $92,000, while other major tokens also saw a sharp decline.Ether, the second-largest digital asset, dropped 4.9%, and Solana fell 8.6% as traders moved to reduce exposure amid global market uncertainty. The downturn came as US equity-index futures also slipped, while gold and silver surged to record levels, according to Bloomberg.Trump announced over the weekend that he would impose a 10% tariff on goods from Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Finland and Britain starting February 1, rising to 25% in June unless a deal is reached on a proposed US purchase of Greenland. The comments drew rebuke from European leaders, who signaled they could halt approval of a trade agreement struck last year.Digital assets had begun 2026 on a positive note, recovering from a weak end to 2025. Bitcoin had risen to just under $98,000 on January 14, supported by strong inflows into US-listed exchange-traded funds tracking the token.Richard Galvin, co-founder of hedge fund DACM, said the early-year gains reflected “a rebound from oversold levels driven by tax-loss selling and general capitulation coming into year-end.”He added that the current selloff is “more a risk-off move than anything crypto-specific,” with gold’s record highs confirming investors are seeking safer assets. CoinGlass data show that about $600 million of bullish cryptocurrency bets were liquidated in the past 24 hours.Traders now see $90,000 as the next key support for Bitcoin if current levels fail, while analysts point to institutional demand as a potential floor. Rachael Lucas, an analyst at BTC Markets, said the market remains cautious but observed that “institutional inflows could help stabilise prices if volatility continues.”","Bitcoin slides 3.6% to below $92,000, while other major tokens also saw a sharp decline.

The BARBIES: From Google to Zepto — what US undergrad returnees are building in India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/the-barbies-from-google-to-zepto-what-us-undergrad-returnees-are-building-in-india/articleshow/126646959.cms,"

The three kinds of US undergrad returnees



1) Ultra-wealthy family business backgrounds

2) Wealthy professional-class families

3) Financial aid and merit-based entrants

What BARBIEs tend to build in India



quick commerce and logistics

ecommerce and consumer brands

fintech and payments

software tools and B2B products built out of India

gaming, entertainment, and social platforms

education and upskilling



Zepto : The clearest recent example of the BARBIE pipeline

Founders and leaders with global exposure shaping India’s startup scene

Some widely cited examples include:

Aadit Palicha and Kaivalya Vohra (Zepto), linked to US university exposure before building one of India’s most prominent quick-commerce startups

Peyush Bansal (Lenskart), who has studied abroad and worked internationally before scaling Lenskart into a major consumer eyewear business

Deepinder Goyal (Zomato), who went from a corporate career into building a consumer internet company that became a major publicly listed platform

Kunal Shah (CRED), who has built consumer-fintech businesses and remained closely connected to global startup thinking and networks

Why India is increasingly the preferred place to build



Where BARBIEs commonly come from

A new label is doing the rounds in India’s startup circles: BARBIEs, short for Bachelors Abroad Returning to Build in the Indian Ecosystem. A viral post shared by Anshul and Anmol on X put the spotlight on this niche but growing group of Indians who study abroad for their undergraduate degree and then come back to India to build high-growth companies. The idea travelled further after it was reposted by entrepreneur and investor Deedy Das.US undergraduate education is also an expensive path. For many families, it can run into hundreds of thousands of dollars over four years, which makes the cohort relatively small compared with the far larger number of Indians who go abroad for Master’s programmes. Even so, BARBIE-style returnees have become increasingly visible in India’s startup world because many of them show up early as builders: launching companies, joining fast-scaling startups, and moving quickly into product and leadership roles.Although US undergrad Indians are often seen as one elite group, their trajectories generally fall into a few patterns, shaped by family background and career incentives.These students often study economics, finance, or fields linked to their family industries. Many return to India quickly, either to join the family business or to start a venture with family backing.This segment includes students from families working in tech, law, finance, or medicine. Many study computer science or engineering, take up jobs in the US after graduation, and some later return to build companies, often in tech-driven sectors.A smaller group reaches top universities through scholarships or financial aid. They are commonly STEM-focused, and many stay in the US longer for work or higher studies. When they do build companies, they often bring strong technical depth and a long-term approach.Most BARBIE-style returnees building in India lean into sectors where India offers massive scale and fast adoption. Their businesses often sit in categories like:The common thread is not just “starting up” but building for India’s size: speed, distribution, hiring at scale, and an obsession with execution.If there is one startup that captures the BARBIE conversation today, it is Zepto.The company’s founders, Aadit Palicha and Kaivalya Vohra, are widely associated with the “US university to India startup” route. Their story has become a reference point for how quickly a new generation can move from global classrooms to India’s high-pressure consumer market, especially in sectors like quick commerce where speed and operations matter as much as product.While BARBIEs specifically points to undergraduate education abroad, India’s broader startup ecosystem also includes founders and leaders shaped by international exposure in different ways, including overseas education, global work experience, and connections to global tech networks.These names are not all “US undergrad returnees”, but they show how global exposure, in different forms, has become a recurring ingredient in India’s modern startup leadership.A major shift over the last decade is that many globally educated Indians no longer view returning to India as a second choice.For some, the US path can feel uncertain due to immigration friction and a highly competitive job market. For others, the pull is simply stronger in India: the ability to build for a massive consumer base, scale quickly, and solve problems that feel more relevant to everyday life.Entrepreneurship has also become more mainstream. Startup culture is now part of popular media and daily conversation, and young founders see building companies as a legitimate first-career move rather than a risky detour.The “Google to Zepto” contrast captures a real choice facing many globally trained Indians.In the US, graduates often gravitate towards stable high-paying roles or tech-first startups, especially in enterprise software and deep-tech. In India, the momentum often sits with consumer-facing companies where distribution, logistics, and speed define success.That is why names like Zepto have become shorthand for the new returnee founder mood: faster, younger, more operational, and focused on building in India rather than waiting for the “perfect time” abroad.This group often emerges from a narrow education pipeline: elite English-medium schools in major metros, and prominent boarding or international schools. Many grow up fluent in English, comfortable in Western academic environments, and able to adapt quickly to US university life.That background often makes it easier to build networks early and navigate global systems. It also means this cohort is small and concentrated.Privilege plays a role, and the cost barrier around overseas undergraduate education makes that unavoidable. But what often stands out about BARBIE-style returnees is the mix of early independence, global exposure, and strong peer networks they bring back with them.In India’s current startup cycle, that combination can translate into speed: faster hiring, clearer product thinking, sharper fundraising instincts, and the confidence to build big early.","A new label is doing the rounds in India’s startup circles: BARBIEs, short for Bachelors Abroad Returning to Build in the Indian Ecosystem.

Greenland row: France’s Macron urges trade 'bazooka' action against US tariffs; seeks activation of EU anti-coercion instrument,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/greenland-row-frances-macron-urges-trade-bazooka-action-against-us-tariffs-seeks-activation-of-eu-anti-coercion-instrument/articleshow/126644693.cms,"AI image (Picture credit: Google Gemini)

Greenland ROASTS Trump; Threatens To Hit U.S. After Takeover Deadline

French President Emmanuel Macron will ask the European Union to activate its powerful anti-coercion instrument if the United States goes ahead with imposing tariffs on European countries amid the standoff over Greenland, according to officials and media reports.Macron’s office said on Sunday that the French president would request the activation of the instrument on behalf of France, reported news agency AFP.The tool, often described as the EU’s trade “bazooka,” has never been used before but allows the bloc to curb imports of goods and services or restrict access to its single market in response to economic coercion.The move comes after US President Donald Trump announced fresh tariffs on Saturday targeting eight European countries, including France, over their support for Greenland.Trump said a 10 per cent tariff on goods from countries such as France, Germany, the UK, Denmark, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and Finland would take effect from February 1, with the levy rising to 25 per cent in June unless “a Deal is reached for the Complete and Total purchase of Greenland.”Macron, who has described the tariff threat as “unacceptable,” has been in contact with European counterparts and will formally raise the issue at the EU level, Bloomberg reported, citing a person close to the French president.EU national ambassadors are set to meet on Sunday to discuss the bloc’s next steps.According to Bloomberg, the anti-coercion instrument allows the EU to respond to deliberate trade pressure by third countries through measures such as tariffs, new taxes on technology companies, curbs on investment, limiting market access or restricting firms from bidding for public contracts.The dispute has also cast doubt on the validity of the EU-US trade deal agreed last year.As per Bloomberg, Macron’s team believes Trump’s tariff plan over Greenland calls into question the deal, which has been partially implemented but still requires parliamentary approval.France’s stance has found backing among several European leaders. Germany’s vice-chancellor and finance minister Lars Klingbeil said “a line had been crossed,” while Denmark’s defence minister Troels Lund Poulsen called the move “unacceptable,” according to the Financial Times.Meanwhile, Chancellor of Germany Friedrich Merz posted on X, ""We stand resolutely and united by the side of Denmark and the people of Greenland. As a Nato member, we are committed to strengthening security in the Arctic. Tariff threats undermine transatlantic relations and carry the risk of escalation.""Finland’s President Alexander Stubb warned that tariffs would “undermine the transatlantic relationship and risk a dangerous downward spiral.”Macron has also reiterated that Europe will not change its position on Greenland. “No intimidation or threat will influence us,” he said.The EU’s anti-coercion instrument, first adopted in 2023, was designed primarily as a deterrent against economic pressure.While some EU diplomats remain cautious about activating it, Sunday’s emergency talks are expected to shape Europe’s response to the tariffs, which several European leaders have criticised as coercive.","French President Emmanuel Macron will ask the European Union to activate its powerful anti-coercion instrument if the United States goes ahead with imposing tariffs.

Women in STEM

crucial for global challenges

Investing in women’s employment is the most efficient way to build a resilient, inclusive and future-proof economy, Ebru Ozdemir, chairperson of the Board of Limak Holding and chair of the World Economic Forum (WEF) Engineering and Construction Industry Group, has said.In an article written ahead of the annual Davos summit, Ozdemir stressed that reskilling and upskilling programmes must be gender-focused to keep pace with the rapidly evolving digital economy.As per news agency ANI, she also underlined the need to integrate more women into STEM professions to secure the human capital required to tackle planetary-scale challenges.“We cannot achieve a sustainable economy without gender parity in STEM. Putting women at the forefront of engineering and technology is the most crucial investment for growth and resilience,” she wrote in the article.In her article titled ‘From digital divide to investment dividend: Why women are the key to a future-proof workforce’, Ozdemir argued that investment in women and girls should be seen not as a social expense but as the highest-return capital expenditure for a resilient and inclusive economy.“The foundational truth remains: Investing in women is investing in humanity's most underutilised economic engine,” she wrote, according to ANI.She added that investing in the skills of female engineers is not just about social justice, but the most direct way to secure specialised human capital needed to address trillion-dollar global problems.“It’s how we ensure that our infrastructure investment is not just built, but built sustainably and inclusively,” she said.The World Economic Forum will hold its 56th Annual Meeting in Davos from January 19 to January 23, 2026.The meeting will bring together nearly 3,000 leaders from over 130 countries under the theme “A Spirit of Dialogue,” amid heightened geopolitical tensions, economic uncertainty and rapid technological change.",Ebru Ozdemir is chairperson of the Board of Limak Holding and chair of the World Economic Forum (WEF) Engineering and Construction Industry Group.

What's wrong with Labubu? Workers at Chinese factory exploited; long work & low pay,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/whats-wrong-with-labubu-workers-at-chinese-factory-exploited-long-work-low-pay/articleshow/126641752.cms,"Remember Labubus, the furry dolls with oversized eyes and a mischievous grin that took the internet by storm in 2025? They are back in the headlines, but this time for all the wrong reasons. A labour rights NGO has revealed exploitative practices at one of the factories producing these quirky dolls, part of the popular toy line from Chinese company Pop Mart, which saw record-breaking sales last year.China Labor Watch (CLW), a New York-based organisation, found that Shunjia Toys in Xinfeng county, Jiangxi province, engaged in multiple labour violations, The Guardian reported. The factory, which employs over 4,500 workers exclusively on Labubus production, was found to hire 16- and 17-year-olds without providing the legal protections required for young workers. Investigators spent three months in 2025 interviewing more than 50 employees, including three under 18.“The underage workers also generally did not understand the nature of the contracts they signed, and had no clear concept of their legal status when asked,” CLW’s report said. The NGO also found that workers routinely signed blank labour contracts. “Workers were given no more than five minutes to complete the process and were told explicitly not to read or fill in other sections,” it added.Employees said that the production targets were unrealistic, with teams of 25–30 expected to assemble at least 4,000 Labubus toys per day. Chinese law limits monthly overtime to 36 hours, but workers reported frequently exceeding 100 extra hours each month.Shunjia Toys has an official annual production capacity of 12 million units, with plans to expand to 33 million by late 2025. CLW’s findings, however, suggest actual production already surpasses official figures, with two teams alone producing more than 24 million units annually. “This gap between planned capacity and actual output is not uncommon in China’s manufacturing sector,” Li Qiang, executive director of CLW told the Guardian. “When market demand rises rapidly, production often expands well beyond planned levels, with the resulting pressure borne directly by workers.”Labubus, part of Pop Mart’s “Monsters” line, generated 4.8 billion yuan (£511 million) in sales in the first half of 2025. Pop Mart’s CEO Wang Ning said in August that the company was on track to reach 20 billion yuan in revenue for the year.A Pop Mart spokesperson responded to the report. “At Pop Mart, we take the welfare and safety of workers at our [original equipment manufacturers] factories very seriously. We conduct regular, standardised audits of our OEM supply chain partners, including annual independent third-party audits carried out by internationally recognised professional audit firms. We appreciate the information brought to our attention and are currently investigating the matter. Going forward, Pop Mart will continue to strengthen supply chain audit and oversight mechanisms. Should the findings be substantiated, we will firmly require the relevant partners to implement comprehensive corrective actions in accordance with local laws and regulations.”The CLW further report noted that such labour issues are common in China’s manufacturing sector, where workers often endure long hours and low pay.","Labubus, part of Pop Mart’s “Monsters” line, generated 4.8 billion yuan (£511 million) in sales in the first half of 2025.

Greenland Explodes, Protesters Storm US Embassy As Trump Vows Takeover By June 1 | ‘Hands Off!’

Why it matters

The big picture

1) Tariffs are coinciding with weaker US job growth - not a revival

2) Inflation remains stubborn, and tariffs are part of the reason

3) China’s trade surplus keeps hitting records - despite US tariffs

4) Tariffs are straining alliances and isolating the US

5) Tariff revenue is real - but economically misleading

Between the lines



What's next



Jobs: Manufacturing and construction employment are already weakening.

Manufacturing and construction employment are already weakening. Inflation: New tariffs risk keeping prices elevated.

New tariffs risk keeping prices elevated. China: Each new trade shock accelerates Beijing’s pivot toward non-US markets.

The bottom line



US President Donald Trump’s latest tariff threat did not emerge from a trade dispute or a factory town. It arrived via Greenland.Trump on Saturday escalated his push to acquire Greenland, vowing to slap a new wave of tariffs on European allies until the United States is allowed to buy the Danish autonomous territory.In a post on Truth Social, Trump said an additional 10% import tariff would take effect on February 1 on goods from Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Finland and Great Britain - with the rate set to rise to 25% on June 1 and remain in place “until such time as a Deal is reached for the Complete and Total purchase of Greenland,” adding that he was “immediately open to negotiation with Denmark and/or any of these Countries. ”Trump accused the targeted nations of “playing this very dangerous game,” warning that “These Countries… have put a level of risk in play that is not tenable or sustainable,” and argued “it is imperative that… strong measures be taken so that this potentially perilous situation end quickly, and without question.”Trump’s threat to impose steep new tariffs on eight European allies over Greenland has reignited a broader debate in Washington and global markets: whether tariffs-now Trump’s primary economic and diplomatic weapon-are doing more harm than good for the United States.Trump said on Truth Social that a new 10% tariff on goods from Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Finland and Great Britain would begin February 1, rising to 25% by June 1 unless the US is allowed to purchase Greenland.European leaders rejected the demand outright, warning that tariffs over a sovereignty dispute threaten Nato unity and transatlantic trade. But the Greenland episode is increasingly seen as a symptom of a larger issue: a tariff strategy that is weighing on US jobs, keeping inflation high, straining alliances and failing to slow China’s export machine.Tariffs now touch nearly every major US trading relationship. Trump has imposed levies of 10–50% on most imports, layered new duties on allies and rivals alike, and tied trade penalties to issues ranging from Iran to Greenland.The result is a US economy that is still growing but more slowly than it would have otherwise alongside mounting evidence that tariffs are undercutting the very goals they were meant to achieve: stronger manufacturing, lower deficits and economic leverage over China.Foreign Policy’s Keith Johnson writes that tariffs have acted “as an anchor, not an engine” for the US economy. Oxford Economics estimates they cut real GDP by 1.1% in 2025 and will drag another 1.4% off growth in 2026.Trump argues tariffs raise revenue, protect jobs, and force rivals to bend. But five trends suggest the opposite is happening.The US labor market is losing momentum, particularly in sectors most exposed to trade.In 2025, job creation was the weakest since the Covid slump, with multiple months of negative employment growth. Manufacturing jobs, which Trump has repeatedly vowed to restore, have begun declining again in his first year back in office, after modest gains during the Biden administration.Foreign Policy reports that real private fixed investment in manufacturing facilities, which had been rising for four years, declined steadily throughout 2025. Economic activity in the manufacturing sector contracted for the 10th straight month in December, with companies citing higher input costs from tariffs and weaker demand.Construction, another employment anchor, is also faltering. Tariffs on steel, copper and lumber have pushed costs higher, contributing to the first sustained decline in construction spending since the early months of the pandemic.The irony: Tariffs meant to protect US jobs are increasingly squeezing the sectors that employ them.Trump has repeatedly argued tariffs don’t cause inflation. But price data suggests otherwise.US CPI inflation has hovered close to 3% for more than a year, refusing to cool meaningfully. Producer prices rose 2.7% through September, driven by higher food and energy costs, both indirectly affected by trade wars, according to Foreign Policy.Tariffs raise the cost of imported inputs for US businesses, from machinery and steel to food and energy components. Many companies initially absorbed those costs in 2025 to protect market share. That buffer is eroding.As inventories normalize in 2026, economists expect more of the tariff burden to be passed directly to consumers, keeping inflation elevated just as the Federal Reserve hopes to declare victory.The Greenland tariffs would hit European industrial goods, machinery and consumer products-precisely the categories most likely to ripple through supply chains and prices.If the goal of tariffs was to curb China’s export dominance, the results are starkly disappointing.China closed 2025 with a record $1.19 trillion trade surplus - the largest ever recorded, even adjusted for inflation.To be sure, exports to the US fell sharply under Trump’s tariffs. But Chinese manufacturers responded by scaling up sales to other markets. Reuters reports exports to Africa jumped 25.8%, shipments to Southeast Asia rose 13.4%, and exports to the EU grew 8.4%.Bloomberg noted that Chinese exporters “aggressively sought out customers in other markets when shipments to the US plunged,” while the New York Times reported that firms increasingly bypass US tariffs by routing goods through Southeast Asia and other intermediaries.HSBC’s Fred Neumann said China’s diversification strategy has “significantly enhanced” its ability to withstand trade shocks.The net effect: US tariffs are reshaping global trade, but not in Washington’s favor.The Greenland episode underscores how tariffs are increasingly colliding with diplomacy and security.European leaders warned Trump’s move risks a “dangerous downward spiral.” British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said “applying tariffs on allies for pursuing the collective security of Nato allies is completely wrong.” EU leaders said they stand in “full solidarity” with Denmark and Greenland.An emergency meeting of EU ambassadors has been called to coordinate a response.Trade experts warn that treating EU countries differently, as Trump proposes, could derail existing trade deals and push Europe closer to alternative partners, including China.William Reinsch of the Center for Strategic and International Studies told Reuters that Trump’s approach may convince the European Parliament it is “pointless” to approve any trade agreement with the US.Tariffs are becoming a wedge between the US and its closest allies, creating openings for Beijing to expand economic and political influence.Trump frequently points to tariff revenue as proof of success. The numbers are striking but incomplete.Politico reports the US has collected $261.6 billion in tariff revenue so far this year, up 186% from last year. But that figure remains dwarfed by the $2.4 trillion raised annually through income taxes.Economists warn tariff revenue often spikes early, then levels off as companies shift supply chains, cut volumes, or find workarounds. High tariffs also reduce overall trade, shrinking the base on which those revenues are collected.There’s also a major legal overhang. The US Supreme Court is considering challenges to Trump’s tariff authority. A decision against Trump could trigger more than $130 billion in refunds to US importers.Trump himself warned the US would be “screwed” if the court overturns the tariffs, saying the fallout could reach “Trillions of Dollars!”.Many of the reasons the US economy avoided a sharper slowdown in 2025 are temporary.Foreign Policy notes companies front-loaded inventories, absorbed costs and delayed investment decisions while waiting for clarity on tariffs. Those cushions are fading in 2026, even as new investigations could bring fresh duties on sectors like solar power, aircraft engines and robotics.Uncertainty itself is becoming a tax, discouraging investment, hiring and long-term planning.Trump says he is “open to negotiation” on Greenland, but European leaders insist the territory is not for sale and warn that backing down under tariff pressure would set a dangerous precedent.Markets are watching three fault lines closely:The Supreme Court’s looming decision could either reinforce Trump’s strategy or dramatically weaken it.In Trump’s first term, tariffs were pitched as shock therapy. In his second, they have hardened into habit.They are used to punish Iran, pressure China, threaten Europe, and now demand the sale of territory from an ally. Legal authority is often vague. Economic consequences are treated as secondary.What has changed is where the damage is landing. Manufacturing investment is down. Job growth has slowed. Prices remain sticky. Allies are alienated. China’s export machine rolls on.Ironically, the presidency with the tariff was meant to project strength abroad. Increasingly, it is being felt at home quietly, steadily, and with effects that are harder to undo than to announce.The policy has reshaped global trade, just not in America’s favor.","US President Donald Trump’s latest tariff threat did not emerge from a trade dispute or a factory town.

European leaders have pushed back against US President Donald Trump’s latest tariff threat, warning that using trade penalties in connection with Greenland is ""wrong"" and could damage transatlantic ties.Trump, on Saturday, announced a 10% tariff on all goods entering the United States from Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Finland, effective February 1.After the threat, leaders across Europe have emphasised that Greenland’s future cannot be controlled through economic pressure and insisted that security cooperation in the Arctic must not be turned into a trade dispute.British PM Keir Starmer took to X, saying that the status of Greenland was not open to outside interference and criticised the use of tariffs against Nato partners. ""Our position on Greenland is very clear – it is part of the Kingdom of Denmark and its future is a matter for the Greenlanders and the Danes. We have also made clear that Arctic Security matters for the whole of Nato and allies should all do more together to address the threat from Russia across different parts of the Arctic.He further added, ""applying tariffs on allies for pursuing the collective security of Nato allies is completely wrong. We will of course be pursuing this directly with the US administration.""French President Emmanuel Macron said that France’s foreign policy is based on defending sovereignty and independence and warned that Europe would not yield to threats.""France is committed to the sovereignty and independence of nations, in Europe and elsewhere ... Tariff threats are unacceptable and have no place in this context. Europeans will respond in a united and coordinated manner should they be confirmed. We will ensure that European sovereignty is upheld. It is in this spirit that I will engage with our European partners.""Sweden’s PM Ulf Kristersson also criticised the tariffs, saying that Stockholm would not accept getting ""blackmailed"" and called for a joint European response. ""We will not let ourselves be blackmailed. Only Denmark and Greenland decide on issues concerning Denmark and Greenland.""He further added, ""I will always stand up for my country, and for our allied neighbors. This is an EU issue that affects many more countries than those now being singled out. Sweden is now having intensive discussions with other EU countries, Norway, and the United Kingdom for a coordinated response.""European Council President Antonio Costa said that Europe and the wider international community must defend territorial integrity and sovereignty, warning that tariffs could spark a dangerous escalation. ""Territorial integrity and sovereignty are fundamental principles of international law. They are essential for Europe and for the international community as a whole. We have consistently underlined our shared transatlantic interest in peace and security in the Arctic, including through Nato. The pre-coordinated Danish exercise, conducted with allies, responds to the need to strengthen Arctic security and poses no threat to anyone.""Costa further highlighted the bloc's support for Denmark and Greenland. ""The EU stands in full solidarity with Denmark and the people of Greenland. Dialogue remains essential, and we are committed to building on the process begun already last week between the Kingdom of Denmark and the US. Tariffs would undermine transatlantic relations and risk a dangerous downward spiral. Europe will remain united, coordinated, and committed to upholding its sovereignty. ""Denmark’s foreign minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said Trump’s remarks were unexpected and insisted that the increased military presence in Greenland was aimed at stability, not confrontation.

‘Be Ready To Pay…’: Trump SHOCKS NATO Allies With New Tariff Warning To Acquire Greenland

European Union leaders on Saturday warned US President Donald Trump against using tariffs as leverage in his bid to acquire Greenland, cautioning that such measures could severely damage transatlantic relations.This comes as Trump said that from February 1, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Finland would face a 10 per cent tariff on all goods exported to the United States.Denmark’s Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said Trump’s comments had come as a surprise, stressing that Greenland’s security posture was already aligned with broader Arctic stability. ""The purpose of the increased military presence in Greenland, to which the president refers, is precisely to enhance security in the Arctic,"" Rasmussen said in a statement sent to AFP.Rasmussen added that Copenhagen was coordinating closely with Brussels and other partners on the issue. ""We are in close contact with the European Commission and our other partners on the matter,"" he said, just days after attending talks at the White House with US and Greenlandic officials on the Greenland question.At the EU level, Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and European Council President Antonio Costa issued a joint statement hours after Trump threatened tariffs of up to 25 per cent on multiple European nations.""Tariffs would undermine transatlantic relations and risk a dangerous downward spiral,"" they wrote in a post on social media.""Europe will remain united, coordinated, and committed to upholding its sovereignty,"" they added.""The EU stands in full solidarity with Denmark and the people of Greenland,"" the statement further said, adding, ""Dialogue remains essential, and we are committed to building on the process begun already last week between the Kingdom of Denmark and the US.""In Germany, senior European Parliament member Manfred Weber warned that Trump’s latest remarks could derail the EU–US trade deal agreed last year.

Safeguard and quotas

ASUNCION: South American and European Union officials on Saturday signed a major trade deal, which they hailed as sending a powerful message at a time of tariff threats, global uncertainty and protectionism.The deal between the 27-nation European Union and Mercosur bloc members Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay creates one of the world's largest free trade areas after 25 years of tricky negotiations.It was given fresh impetus amid the sweeping use of tariffs and trade threats by US President Donald Trump's administration, which has sent countries scrambling for new partnerships.Trump on Saturday threatened multiple European nations with tariffs of up to 25 percent until he manages to gain control of the Danish territory Greenland.""We choose fair trade over tariffs, we choose a productive long-term partnership over isolation,"" EU chief Ursula Von der Leyen said at the signing ceremony in Asuncion, Paraguay.Paraguay's President Santiago Pena also praised the treaty as sending ""a clear signal in favor of international trade"" in ""a global scenario marked by tensions.""European Council head Antonio Costa said the deal stood in contrast to ""the use of trade as a geopolitical weapon.""And Brazil's Foreign Minister Mauro Vieira said the deal was a ""bulwark ... in the face of a world battered by unpredictability, protectionism, and coercion.""Brazil's President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva -- a key architect of the accord -- was unable to attend the ceremony due to scheduling conflicts, and met with Von der Leyen in Rio de Janeiro on Friday where he praised it as a victory for multilateralism.In Paraguay, leaders said the treaty would bring jobs, prosperity, and opportunities to people on both sides of the Atlantic.Together, the EU and Mercosur account for 30 percent of global GDP and more than 700 million consumers.The treaty -- which still needs to be approved by the EU parliament and ratified by each Mercosur nation -- eliminates tariffs on more than 90 percent of bilateral trade.It is expected to come into force by the end of 2026.The deal will favor European exports of cars, wine and cheese, while making it easier for South American beef, poultry, sugar, rice, honey and soybeans to enter Europe.This has angered European farmers, who have rolled tractors into cities like Paris, Brussels and Warsaw to protest a feared influx of cheaper goods produced with lower standards and banned pesticides.""We have good quality Irish beef and good standards here, and they don't have the same standards in South American countries,"" said Trisha Chatterton, a 50-year-old farmer at a protest in Ireland earlier this month.""It's not fair,"" said Luis, a 24-year-old Belgian cattle farmer who took part in a December protest that turned ugly, as demonstrators set piles of tires on fire and hurled potatoes at police.Key power Germany, as well as Spain and the Nordic countries, strongly support the pact, eager to boost exports as Europe grapples with Chinese competition and a tariff-happy administration in the White House.Some in South America are also wary about the impact of the treaty.In Argentina, it is estimated that there could be a loss of 200,000 jobs just from the dismantling of the local automotive industry, trade and investment researcher Luciana Ghiotto told AFP.In a bid to allay fears, the European Commission announced a crisis fund and safeguards allowing for the suspension of preferential tariffs in case of a damaging surge in imports.However Argentina's libertarian President Javier Milei warned against quotas and safeguard which ""will significantly reduce the economic impact of the agreement and will go against its essential objective.""According to EU estimates, European exports to Mercosur are expected to rise by 39 percent, while Mercosur exports to the EU could increase by 17 percent.By 2040, the agreement is projected to boost EU GDP by 77.6 billion euros and Mercosur GDP by 9.4 billion euros.",South American and European Union officials sign a major trade deal.

‘Be Ready To Pay…’: Trump SHOCKS NATO Allies With New Tariff Warning To Acquire Greenland

Add “Greenland tariffs” to Russian oil tariffs, BRICS tariffs, Iran tariffs, Liberation Day tariffs etc. Declaring himself “Tariff King,” US President Donald Trump escalated the idea of taxing the world’s imports to “Make America Great Again” imposing 10 per cent tariffs on eight European countries — including Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Finland— to force them to cede Greenland to the US.Effective February 1, 2026, the US would impose 10% tariffs on the eight European countries ""until such time as a Deal is reached for the Complete and Total purchase of Greenland,"" Trump said in a post on Truth Social on Sunday, evidently irked by some of them sending troops to Greenland to support Denmark. If a deal was not struck by June 1, the tariff will be increased to 25 percent, he added.Trump claimed that the United States has been trying to do this transaction for over 150 years, and “many Presidents have tried, and for good reason, but Denmark has always refused.” Now, because of The Golden Dome, and Modern Day Weapons Systems, both Offensive and Defensive, the need to ACQUIRE is especially important, he said. Hundreds of Billions of Dollars are currently being spent on Security Programs having to do with “The Dome,” including for the possible protection of Canada, and “this very brilliant, but highly complex system can only work at its maximum potential and efficiency, because of angles, metes, and bounds, if this Land is included in it,” Trump added.The US President also accused the countries sending their military to Greenland of playing a very “dangerous game,” putting “a level of risk in play that is not tenable or sustainable.” Therefore, it is imperative that, in order to protect Global Peace and Security, strong measures be taken so that this potentially perilous situation end quickly, and without question, he said.Denmark and Greenland have refuted Trump’s charge that the Arctic is overrun by Russian and Chinese vessels and the two countries are out to grab the territory.The latest tariff announcement comes at a fraught moment for transatlantic relations. European governments have publicly rejected the idea of selling Greenland, asserting that decisions about the territory are strictly a matter for Denmark and Greenlandic authorities. European Union and Nato officials have warned that invoking tariffs against allies over territorial political disputes could undermine the foundation of the post–World War II security architecture.Trump’s announcement revived broader elements of his aggressive tariff strategy first rolled out in 2025. During that earlier phase, he promulgated sweeping “reciprocal” tariffs on more than 180 countries, including a baseline 10 percent rate on many trading partners and higher rates on China and the EU, claiming the measures would correct trade imbalances. The roster of affected nations has included Canada, Japan, South Korea, India, and others, with rates ranging from 10 percent up to nearly 50 percent under Trump’s rhetoric.Trump has repeatedly referred to himself, in social media posts and campaign rhetoric, as the “tariff king,” underscoring his belief that tariffs are both a political tool and an economic weapon. In past engagements, he has threatened punitive duties on China, the European Union, Mexico, and other major economies, often in blunt and transactional language that bypasses traditional diplomatic channels.But the recent tariff gambit has drawn intense bipartisan scrutiny at home. Even within Republican circles, unease is growing over the breadth and implications of Trump’s tariff policy. A group of GOP seNators has introduced legislation—the Trade Review Act of 2025—to rein in executive authority on tariffs and restore congressional oversight, a clear signal of mounting institutional pushback.In MAGA-aligned spheres, reactions have been mixed. Some hard-line supporters laud Trump’s confrontational posture toward allies perceived as freeloading on US. security commitments, arguing that “America must be strong and assertive.” But other prominent conservatives and business voices warn that tariffs risk inflationary pressures, disrupted supply chains, and retaliation, potentially harming US. exporters and farmers. Analysts have also pointed to global market volatility sparked by earlier rounds of Trump’s tariffs.Diplomatically, the implications are profound. Nato, long grounded in shared security interests, now faces stress not solely from external threats but from internal discord. Europe’s anger over punitive duties could erode political trust, complicate burden-sharing discussions, and fuel narratives of a fracturing alliance at a moment of Russian and Chinese assertiveness. Canada, a founding member of Nato, has already made tracks towards Beijing.","US President Donald Trump has threatened to impose 10 per cent tariffs on eight European countries to force them to cede Greenland to the US.

The European Union and the Mercosur on Saturday formally signed a long-awaited free trade agreement, closing more than 25 years of negotiations and creating one of the world’s largest integrated trading zones.The agreement was signed in Asunción, marking a significant geopolitical win for the EU at a time of intensifying global trade frictions, rising tariffs and expanding Chinese exports. The pact also signals South America’s intent to maintain diversified economic and diplomatic ties, even as the United States sharpens its trade posture in the Western Hemisphere.The deal brings together a combined market of over 700 million people, accounting for roughly a quarter of global gross domestic product. It aims to progressively reduce tariffs on a vast majority of goods traded between the two blocs, opening new opportunities for South American agricultural exporters and European manufacturers seeking access to fast-growing markets.Speaking at the signing ceremony, Ursula von der Leyen said the agreement carried major strategic weight at a time when free trade is increasingly under pressure.“The geopolitical importance of this agreement cannot be overstated,” von der Leyen said, adding, “We choose fair trade over tariffs.We choose a productive long-term partnership over isolation.”She said the pact reflects a shared belief that deeper cooperation is the best way to generate growth and prosperity on both sides of the Atlantic.The ceremony was attended by the presidents of Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay, along with Brazil’s foreign minister, representing Mercosur’s largest economy.For the EU, the agreement strengthens its footprint in a resource-rich region that has become a focal point of competition between Washington and Beijing. For Mercosur members, the deal promises expanded access to European markets for agricultural products, while reinforcing their position as global trade partners beyond any single power centre.The accord still faces ratification processes within individual EU member states and Mercosur countries, but Saturday’s signing marks the most decisive step yet toward reshaping trade relations between Europe and South America in an increasingly fragmented global economy.","The European Union and the Mercosur on Saturday formally signed a long-awaited free trade agreement.

NEW DELHI: More than 1.14 lakh startups in India have created over 12 lakh jobs so far, the finance ministry said in its latest review of the Indian economy.In the report titled, ‘The Indian Economy: A Review January 2024’, the Department of Economic Affairs said that the 1.14 lakh startups recognised by the government under the 'Startup India initiative’ created more than 12 lakh jobs (as of October 2023).The state-owned e-commerce platform Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) clocked more than 63 lakh transactions till November 2023, the document read.Despite facing global challenges in 2023 like valuation issues, few IPOs, regulatory changes and macroeconomic and geopolitical trends, India remains the third largest tech start-up ecosystem globally, with over 950 tech startups founded last year.The cumulative funding for more than 31,000 tech start ups has exceeded $70 billion (from 2019 to 2023), according to a recent report by Nasscom in collaboration with Zinnov.“In 2023, despite facing global economic and regulatory challenges, Indian tech startups have prioritised the imperative of enhancing their business fundamentals, driving profitability and growth,” said Debjani Ghosh, President, Nasscom.“The proliferation of tech startups in tier 2 and 3 cities marks the ecosystem's resilience,” she added.Navigating 2024, tech startup founders expect to continue the revenue growth path with measured steps focusing on optimising expenditure and maximising profitability for B2B tech startups.Investments in deeptech will continue an upward trend in 2024.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021.

The Series A funding round was led by Lightspeed Venture Partners, and participants included Silicon Valley billionaire Vinod Khosla’s Khosla Ventures and Peak XV Partners, formerly Sequoia Capital India & Southeast Asia, Sarvam said Thursday.The Bangalore-based startup, until recently in stealth mode, was co-founded by Vivek Raghavan and Pratyush Kumar. It has ambitious plans to build open source foundational AI systems as well as tools for creating apps for the meager compute infrastructure available to developers in India. The startup has a total of 18 employees and is just opening an office in the city.""What we are showing is that you can build large language models with limited resources,” Raghavan said in a phone interview. ""We are building at a smaller scale and demonstrating that these can be extremely cost and energy efficient so they can be accessed by everyone.""Large language models, like OpenAI’s GPT-4 and Meta Platforms Inc.’s Llama, are powerful AI systems that understand by learning from vast amounts of diverse data from the internet and elsewhere to summarize, translate, and create text, audio and video for a wide range of applications.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor (CEA) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran Udaan until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.Udaan built an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business still accounts for a very small part of India’s overall retail market but can balloon to $150 billion in sales and yield a 100% return on capital invested in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co. estimates published in the Mint newspaper.Bengaluru-based Udaan has also ventured into financing through its fintech unit which helps shopkeepers get working capital loans to buy inventory. That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says.

How India's GDP has been growing

What SBI report said on savings and investment

Incremental capital output ratio

NEW DELHI: India's gross domestic product (GDP) data for the third quarter (October-December 2022) received a word of caution from the former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan In an interview with news agency PTI, Rajan that India is ""dangerously close"" to the Hindu rate of growth in view of subdued private sector investment, high interest rates and slowing global growth.India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying"".However, a report released by the State Bank of India (SBI) economists on Tuesday dismissed arguments that India is dangerously close to Hindu rate of growth saying such statements are ""ill-conceived, biased and premature"".The term 'Hindu growth rate' was coined by late economist Raj Krishna in 1978 to describe the slow growth in the country.It basically refers to the low pace of economic growth rates during 1950s to 1980s. During this period, the Indian economy averaged 3.5%.A former lecturer at the Delhi School of Economics (DSE), Krishna noted that only if the rate of growth is persistently slow and accompanied by low per-capita GDP, then it will be known as Hindu rate of growth but it has to factor in population growth as well.Before economic reforms of 1991, India's economic growth remained stagnant and low, while per capita income averaged around 1.3%.Krishna termed this low growth situation to be a result of socialist policies of state control and import substitution.However, the economic situation changed when liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation (LPG) reforms came into effect in the year 1991, at a time when India faced balance of payment crisis.Over the years, many economists have strongly opposed the idea of 'Hindu growth rate' and the term never had universal acceptance.The Indian economy plunged into its very first technical recession in FY21 due to the impact of Covid-19 pandemic and the related nationwide lockdowns. GDP shrunk by an unprecedented 23.8% in the first quarter of the financial year 2020-21. However, due to spurt in economic activities in the subsequent quarters, the GDP decline started to narrow.However, if we look at the period before Covid-19 as well, India's growth curve shows a declining trend.From 8.26% in FY17, GDP growth plunged to 3.74% in FY20. Shutdown of economic activities in FY21 in wake of Covid-19 only made matters worse.As lockdowns started to ease and business activities resumed, India's GDP also started rising. In Q1 of FY22, growth jumped to 20.1% mainly on account of low base effect. By the fourth quarter of FY22, growth came down to 4.10%.Similarly, the new financial year 2022-23 brought fresh economic challenges in the form of Russia-Ukraine war that impacted almost all major economies of the world, slowed the pace of growth, pushed inflation to record highs.As a result, the central banks of all advanced economies spurred into action and opted for monetary policy tightening to curb the soaring inflation.With persistently rising interest rates, India's economy grew by 4.4% in Q3 of FY23, as the Centre revised upwards GDP growth for previous year to 9.10% from 8.7% earlier.The report weighed recent GDP numbers against the available data on savings and investments for the past decade and highlighted some interesting points.""Quarterly growth numbers are noisy and should be best avoided for any serious interpretation (on an average, India's GDP growth has witnessed Rs 2 lakh crore upward revision for the 3 year ended FY23),"" the report said.Gross capital formation (GCF) by the government touched a high of 11.8% in 2021-22, up from 10.7% in 2020-21.""This also had a domino effect on private sector investment that jumped from 10 per cent to 10.8% over the same period,"" it said.In fact, Ecowrap added that the trends in GCF to gross output ratio or the plough back of funds for creation of fresh capacity shows that for public administration the ratio attained fresh peak in 2021-22 owing to the emphasis on capital expenditure in recent budgets.At the aggregate level, gross capital formation is supposed to have crossed 32% in 2022-23, the highest level since 2018-19.According to the report, in 2021-22, gross savings have risen to 30% from 29% in 2020-21.""The ratio is supposed to have crossed 31 per cent in 2022-23, the highest since 2018-19. The household savings increased sharply during the pandemic period on account of sharp accretion in financial savings such as deposits,"" said the report by SBI's Economic Research Department.While household financial savings have since then moderated from 15.4% in 2020-21 to 11.1% in 2022-23, savings in physical assets have grown sharply to 11.8% in 2021-22 from 10.7% in 2020-21.The report further analysed Incremental Capital Output ratio (ICOR) -- which measures additional units of capital (investment) needed to produce additional units of output. It said that the ratio has been improving.""ICOR which was 7.5 in FY 12 is now only 3.5 in FY22. Clearly, only half of capital is now needed for next unit of output,"" the report noted.Such reducing ICOR in the current years reflects a relatively increasing efficiency of capital and shows that the economy is on a sound footing, the report said.""From that point of view, future GDP growth rates even at 7% could still mean a decent number by any standards!,"" it added.","India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.

An employee is entitled for a 50 per cent amount of the last drawn salary as pension.OPS was discontinued by the NDA government in 2003 with effect from April 1, 2004.Under the new pension scheme (NPS), employees contribute 10 per cent of their basic salary towards pension while the government contributes 14 per cent.Governments of Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand have informed the central government/ Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA about their decision to restart OPS for their employees.The government of Punjab on November 18, 2022, issued a notification regarding implementation of OPS for the state government employees who are being covered under NPS. Jharkhand too has decided to revert to OPS.",Former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan has expressed his concern over the decision of some states to restart the old pension scheme.

For instance, soft drinks face a 12% compensation cess, taking the overall tax burden to 40%. For certain tobacco products, the effective rate tops 100%, including cess.Industry watchers said having categorised these items as ""sin goods"" govt is unlikely to leave them with a lower effective rate once compensation cess is removed from April 2026. They expect a new cess to come in, which can be used by the Centre to meet specific funding requirements in sectors, such as health or education.Responding to reports of the special rate, Krishan Arora, partner at consulting firm Grant Thornton Bharat said: ""This proposal appears to be aimed at compensating for potential revenue shortfalls resulting from reduced rates on common-use items and exemptions, such as those related to health and life insurance premiums. By rationalising rates, the GoM's strategy appears to seek a revenue-neutral position, balancing the anticipated revenue decline from reductions in health and life insurance with the revenue increases from adjustments on other products.""The Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs however, said the news reports are premature as a group of ministers led by Bihar deputy CM Samrat Chaudhary is working on the recommendations and is yet to submit its report.""The GoM is only a recommendatory body. The GST Council has not yet deliberated on any GST rate changes. The Council has not even received trecommendations of the GoM.

Among the 19 amendments is plan to transfer unclaimed dividends, shares, and bond interests to Investor Education and Protection Fund for easier reclaim by rightful owners.""The proposed amendments will strengthen governance in banking sector and enhance customer convenience with respect to nomination and protection of investors,"" Sitharaman said while moving the bill.Responding to debate on the bill, she said the number of branches of scheduled commercial bank has increased to 1.6 lakh, at end of Sept, compared to under 1.2 lakh in March 2014, with 3,792 branches added since Sept 2023. ""Banks are being professionally run today. The metrics are healthy so they can go to the market and raise bonds, raise loans and run their business accordingly,"" the FM said, while stressing the role of banks in national growth. She attributed the current stability to careful policy measures implemented since 2014 that have allowed banks to operate professionally and leverage market opportunities.The bill also invited criticism from opposition. TMC MP Kalyan Banerjee alleged that the bill was a ""covert step towards privatising public sector banks"" by potentially reducing govt stakes. He raised concern over cyber security and the necessity for advanced fraud detection systems. Samajwadi Party's Rajeev Rai brought up the plight of borrowers facing credit issues due to poor communication from banks, while DMK's Rani Srikumar questioned transparency of banking fees. Congress MP Karti Chidambaram spoke against the bill for not living up to govt's promise of ""majestic reforms"".TDP's D Prasada Rao praised support public sector banks provide to small businesses, crediting BJP-TDP alliance. Sena UBT's Anil Desai noted a trend of investors moving towards alternative investments, and NCP (SP)'s Supriya Sule advocated for stronger measures against financial frauds.","Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said public sector banks are now safe, stable, healthy, and showing ""exceptional performance"" Lok Sabha passed crucial amendments to banking laws, which among other things provides for up to four nominees in all bank accounts.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115949318,imgsize-97090,width-400,resizemode-4/115949318.jpg"

BENGALURU: Rohit Jetly , who until recently served as the country head for India at global investment and retirement savings business Fidelity International , was given additional responsibilities. His expanded role now includes overseeing technology and operations for the company's global platform solutions (GPS) division. Its HR head, Upasna Nischal, succeeds Jetly as the new India site leader. These changes reflect Fidelity International’s commitment to strengthening its leadership and capabilities in the country.The Bengaluru centre complements the Gurugram and Mumbai offices that already employ 4,500 people, the largest hub outside the UK. Fidelity International operates in more than 25 locations and manages $925.7 billion in total assets. Its clients include central banks, sovereign wealth funds, large corporations, financial institutions, insurers, and wealth managers.In his elevated role, Jetly will work synergistically with technology and operations functions worldwide for Fidelity International's GPS division. The GPS unit consolidates personal investing, workplace investing, and advisor services under the Fidelity International umbrella. “My role is not running a classic technology organisation and serving the customer operationally. It's about how you bring these two groups together, build a far more integrated operating model, so that the customer wins, and we are able to offer the right things to the right customers in a very frictionless way,” he said.Data-driven decision-making draws upon extensive information generated across operational and technological domains. Their integration enables more dynamic customer service through agile methodologies. Jetly highlighted that the evolving nature of compliance necessitates appropriate investments throughout the digital customer journey. “As we progress, financial risk and fraud present significant challenges. Leveraging AI systems into daily operations enables us to distinguish between fraudulent activities and genuine customer interaction during routine tasks,” he said.Jetly put together a unique GCC governance model that continues to help drive strategic priorities. “We want the net promoter score (NPS) to go up, so that's a big outcome that we are pursuing. We are pursuing a very important aspect of client retention and growth.

These airlines saw the most delays and complaints in 2024,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/these-airlines-saw-the-most-delays-and-complaints-in-2024/articleshow/115954750.cms,"Curious to know the airlines that topped or tanked on AirHelp’s 2024 global rankings? Here’s a quick list.

Worst airlines in the world

Best airlines in the world

The Sunday after Thanksgiving weekend marked a fresh record for US air travel with the Transportation Security Administration screening more than 3 million passengers in a single day. That doesn’t mean everything went smoothly, of course.AirHelp Inc., which facilitates compensation for passengers by processing customer service claims for flight disruptions and lost luggage, has released its annual analysis of the best and worst performing airlines. The 2024 AirHelp Score report , published on Tuesday, comes just in time for the holiday season.The airline rankings methodology takes into account customer claims processed worldwide, as well as outside data tracking on-time arrival and departure performance for every plane, plus feedback from passengers from over 54 countries on the quality of food, comfort and crew service on their most recent flight. The aim is to give a snapshot of airline performance, says AirHelp Chief Executive Officer Tomasz Pawliszyn, with hope that the analysis “encourages airlines to continuously listen to passenger feedback.” Data analyzed for this round spanned from January through October.The worst performing airline in the world? That’s Tunisair, coming in last at No. 109. Keeping it company in the bottom 10 are a handful of national and low-cost carriers, including Buzz, a Polish airline that is a subsidiary of Ryanair Holdings PLC, Bulgaria Air, Turkish carrier Pegasus Airlines and Air Mauritius. But ranking in the bottom 50, too, are North American carriers JetBlue and Air Canada.Sort the results based solely on customer opinion and Tunisair keeps the title of the worst performing, followed closely by Ryanair and Aer Lingus, a subsidiary of IAG SA, which also owns British Airways and Iberia.As for the best all-around airline globally: It’s Brussels Airlines, part of Deutsche Lufthansa AG, bumping Qatar Airways to No. 2 after holding the top spot since 2018. That’s a marked improvement for the Belgian national airline that was rated No. 12 last year.Both United Airlines and American Airlines ranked in the top five, in third and fourth place respectively, which might come as a surprise to US travelers given the flight disruptions which plagued domestic airlines this past year. Both have consistently ranked in AirHelp’s top 10 since at least 2022.“We also had a new North American nominee come through this year, Air Transat, the Canadian airline was ranked in position 36,” notes Pawliszyn. Delta Air Lines dropped to No. 17 from No. 11 in 2023, which Pawliszyn explains is due to a reduction in its claim processing score, while its on-time performance and customer opinion rankings haven’t shifted much. The airline’s July tech outage led to more than 3,000 complaints being filed about Delta with the Department of Transportation.Alaska Airlines, due to merge with Hawaiian Holdings Inc., also dropped more than 30 spots to No. 88 this year.100.

Retailers have been strategizing to pull in US shoppers with notifications, mails and other heavily touted ads.With a little more than three weeks before Christmas, experts say this year's discounts have been steeper, as shoppers are holding out for days packed with promotions. Retail chain Target, announced a ""two-day Cyber Monday"" starting on Sunday, offering 50 per cent discount off thousands of items that included video games, home decor and other technology.According to preliminary estimates from payments processor Mastercard, sales at brick-and-mortar stores on Friday increased by only 0.7 per cent compared to last year. Meanwhile, data firm Facteus reported that sales were actually down.In order to make it easier to help shoppers find their products on websites and mobile apps, Amazon, Walmart and other online retailers relied on generative AI customer service and search features. Cheyenne Berens, a 29-year-old resident of Pittsburgh, also used Amazon’s generative AI chatbot services to track price of merchandise, as quoted by Reuters.""I have found that using Rufus on Amazon has been extremely helpful in determining whether a 'deal' is actually a 'deal',"" Berens said.Caila Schwartz, director of consumer insights at Salesforce which is a cloud computing company that monitors global shopping data from over 1.5 billion consumers, explained that GenAI tools, like chatbots that handle basic queries from online shoppers about products, have helped retailers safeguard their profit margins despite increasing costs.He also noted that, according to Salesforce estimates, retailers who utilized GenAI tools for customer service experienced a 15 per cent higher purchase rate among users on Saturday. Schwartz said that the higher conversion rate acted as “a game changer.”According to preliminary estimates from Adobe Inc., online spending in the United States on Monday is projected to hit $13.2 billion, a 6 per cent increase from Cyber Monday last year. This follows the approximately $10.8 billion Americans spent online on Black Friday, as reported by Adobe.Adobe reported that traffic to retail sites from chatbots or shoppers clicking on website links increased by 1,800 per cent from Black Friday through the weekendWith many Americans taking on more debt, most are turning to third-party 'buy now, pay later' services, and spending on these services is expected to reach $1 billion, according to Adobe projections.

Rupee falls to record low on Trump's threat of 100% tariffs on BRICS,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/rupee-falls-to-record-low-on-trumps-threat-of-100-tariffs-on-brics/articleshow/115913935.cms,".

MUMBAI: The rupee fell to a record low of 84.73 against the dollar on Monday, weakening 0.2% for its worst single-day decline since June 4. It touched an intraday low of 84.73 before closing at 84.70 - 14 paise weaker than Friday's close. This was driven by strong dollar demand in the non-deliverable forward (NDF) markets after weaker-than-expected Q2 growth numbers. RBI intervention , however, has helped limit further losses.Recently, global factors have compounded the rupee's woes. The dollar's strong performance also follows US President-elect Donald Trump's recent warnings to BRICS nations against creating an alternative to the dollar, and threatening 100% tariffs. This geopolitical tension - coupled with potential Chinese retaliation by devaluing the yuan - has intensified market uncertainty. Analysts predict continued FII outflows amid these challenges.""It is no longer just macroeconomic factors that are determining the value of the rupee... it is more of geopolitics and the new US administration's stance on trade. Trump's warning to BRICS to impose 100% tariff if an alternative arrangement to the dollar if pursued may have an impact on the rupee,"" Ashhish Vaidya, head of treasury at DBS Bank, said.Traders foresee the rupee trading between 84.50 and 84.95 in the near term, with crude oil recovery posing additional risks. However, positive domestic market trends may provide some support. ""It is difficult to forecast a level for the rupee. It is not a long way from 85. The question is how far can it go? The double whammy for India would be a stronger dollar and a reduction in govt spending in the US, which could create pressure on most other currencies. Once the new administration in the US is in place and announces some of its policies, it will give the market some sense of direction,"" Vaidya added.","The rupee fell to a record low of 84.73 against the dollar on Monday, weakening 0.2% for its worst single-day decline since June 4.

Stellantis chief executive Carlos Tavares on Sunday resigned ""with immediate effect"", the auto giant announced, signalling differences over how to confront the group's profit slump.The Italian-US-French company, whose 14 brands include Fiat, Peugeot-Citroen, Opel, Maserati, Chrysler, Ram and Jeep, said in a statement that the board had accepted the resignation of the 66-year-old Portuguese executive.""In recent weeks different views have emerged which have resulted in the board and the CEO coming to today's decision,"" independent director Henri de Castries said in the statement, without giving details.The group said in September that it had started looking for a successor for Tavares, who had been due to stand down when his current five-year contract ends in early 2026.""The process to appoint the new permanent chief executive officer is well under way, managed by a special committee of the board, and will be concluded within the first half of 2025,"" said the statement.It added that an ""interim executive committee"" led by chairman John Elkann will run the company until then.Stellantis has reported growing difficulties in recent months that Tavares had acknowledged as stormy. Several model launches were delayed because of electrical problems.Elkann has dismissed any further merger with another group, while Tavares had hinted that the door was open for a deal.A Stellantis earnings report in July said sales in North America, the main profit source, were down 18 percent in the first six months.It later cut its profit forecast and said third-quarter sales in North America were down 20 percent on the 2023 figure.Like other auto groups, Stellantis has blamed competition from China and the difficult transition to electric cars for much of its troubles.Tavares started his career in the car industry with Renault before becoming chief executive of the old Peugeot-Citroen (PSA) group in 2014, where he made his name as a cost-cutter and guided the French group's merger with Germany's Opel.A collector of vintage racing cars, Tavares was made chief executive of Stellantis when PSA and Fiat-Chrysler merged in 2021 to form the new group.At the start it made impressive profits and invested quickly in electric and hybrid vehicles. A shortage of computer chips meant there were shortages that allowed carmakers to charge high prices.The market has since stabilised at lower prices and the storm clouds started gathering with this year's profit figures.In September Tavares had to abandon his aim of double-digit profit margins for the year that had partly been used to justify his 36.5 million euro ($38.6 million) salary for 2023.The Stellantis statement confirmed the forecast made in October of profit margins between 5.5% and 7.0% of turnover.Production cuts in several factories have worried workers and governments. In October, thousands staged demonstrations against reduced Fiat production in Italy. The group has shifted production from Western Europe to lower-cost factories in countries like Turkey, Brazil, and Morocco.Tavares has since assured that the situation is improving in the United States and that Stellantis is not alone in facing challenges in Europe.Last week, the group announced the closure of a factory in Luton, England, resulting in the loss of 1,100 jobs. While production has been reduced in France, the company has pledged not to shut down any factories there.","Stellantis chief executive Carlos Tavares resigns ""with immediate effect"" Tavares made his name as a cost-cutter and guided PSA's merger with Opel.

TOI explains: What's behind Donald Trump's threat of 100% tariff on Brics?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/toi-explains-whats-behind-trumps-threat-of-100-tariff-on-brics/articleshow/115877140.cms,"What is reserve currency?

Sanctions, weaponising the dollar

Incentive to de-dollarise

Cost of highly valued dollar

On Nov 30, US President-elect Donald Trump issued this threat on his social media TruthSocial: ""The idea that the BRICS Countries are trying to move away from the Dollar, while we standby and watch is OVER. We require a commitment from these Countries that they will neither create a new BRICS currency, nor back any other currency to replace the mighty US Dollar or, they will face 100% tariffs, and should expect to say goodbye to selling into the wonderful US Economy.""India is a founding member of BRICS that now has nine member states. US dollar has been the world's most used currency since the end of the second World War, before which UK pound was the most in use. Most countries use dollar for two primary purposes: Currency to hold foreign exchange reserves and currency for trade and other global transactions. The chart below shows dollar's dominant, but declining, position as preferred reserve currencyA reserve currency is a foreign currency that central banks hold as part of its country's formal foreign exchange reserves. By buying and selling currencies on the open market, a central bank, such as RBI, can influence the value of its country's currency (rupee), which can provide stability and maintain investor confidence. Most countries want to hold their reserves in a currency with large and open financial markets, since they want to be sure that they can access their reserves when they need. Central banks often hold currency in the form of govt bonds, such as US treasuries. The US treasury market remains by far the world's largest and most liquid - the easiest to buy into and sell out of - bond market.In addition to accounting for majority of reserves, dollar remains the currency of choice for international trade. Major commodities, such as oil, are primarily bought and sold using US dollar, and some major economies, including Saudi Arabia, still peg their currencies to the dollar.High dollar demand enables US to borrow money at a lower cost, since higher demand for a govt's bonds means it doesn't have to pay as much interest to entice buyers, and helps to keep cost of its huge external debt down. Some experts say this benefit is modest, pointing to the fact that other developed countries are able to borrow at similarly low rates. Former Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke had argued that the US's falling share of the global economy and rise of other currencies, such as euro and yen, have eroded the US advantage.Dollar's centrality to the system of global payments also increases the power of US financial sanctions . Almost all trade done in US dollar, even trade among other countries, can be subject to US sanctions, because they are handled by so-called correspondent banks with accounts at the Federal Reserve. By cutting off the ability to transact in dollar, the US can make it difficult for those it blacklists to do business. For example, in the wake of Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, US sanctions cut Russia off from the dollar, freezing $300 billion in Russian central bank assets and triggering a default on the country's sovereign debt. If use of dollar falls, so will be the effectiveness of US sanctions.Ajay Srivastava, founder of Global Trade Research Initiative, says: ""The US has a history of leveraging its influence over global financial systems, such as the SWIFT network, to impose unilateral sanctions. SWIFT - the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication - is essential for secure and standardised international financial transactions. By blocking countries like Russia and Iran from accessing SWIFT, the US has effectively weaponised the global financial infrastructure, forcing other nations to find alternative payment mechanisms to continue legitimate trade.""Trump's threat is unrealistic. Tariffs of this scale would harm US consumers by raising domestic prices, disrupt global trade, and risk retaliation from key trading partners. A global shift away from dollar is a complex process driven by economic diversification, not easily deterred by threats,"" Srivastava adds.Though dollar still dominates, most economists say its role in the international financial system should not be taken for granted, because there are economic and geopolitical incentives for other countries to 'de-dollarise'. At an April 2023 summit of BRICS countries, Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva asked, ""Why can't we do trade based on our own currencies?""After the US sanctions India's has been buying oil from Russia without using dollar. China too has done the same. But, the idea of developing a BRICS currency hasn't yet taken shape largely due to structural challenges in member countries, including a lack of robust central banks and monetary policies. The share of Chinese Renminbi in global reserves has risen by three times - 1% to 3% - since 2016. This factor may be the primary reason behind Trump's outburst.A highly valued dollar is not without a cost to US. While it makes imports into US cheaper, it makes US exports expensive, which can hurt its industries selling goods abroad and potentially leads to job losses. US is also harmed by currency manipulation - when another country holds down value of its currency to maintain a large trade surplus. If a country keeps the value of its currency artificially low by accumulating dollar reserves, its exports will become more competitive, while US exports will become comparatively more expensive. China has historically been among the worst offenders.While dollar will not be overtaken as the world's leading reserve currency anytime soon, it will slowly come to share influence with other currencies. The trend will be accelerated by the aggressive use of US sanctions and kind of threats Trump issued on Saturday.",US dollar has been the world's most used currency since the end of the second World War. Most countries use dollar for two primary purposes: Currency to hold foreign exchange reserves and currency for trade and other global transactions. Dollar's centrality to the system of global payments also increases the power of US financial sanctions.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115877161,imgsize-37706,width-400,resizemode-4/115877161.jpg"

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume.While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor ( CEA ) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September.

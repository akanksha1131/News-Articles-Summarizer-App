"India-UK FTA boost: Trade volume expected to double in 5-6 years, says ICRA",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/india-uk-fta-boost-trade-volume-expected-to-double-in-5-6-years-says-icra-report/articleshow/121247731.cms,"AI-generated image

NEW DELHI: India’s trade in apparel and home textiles with the United Kingdom is set for significant growth, with volumes expected to double over the next five to six years, according to a report by credit rating agency ICRA. The projected surge is attributed to the recently concluded Free Trade Agreement (FTA) between the two countries, which is slated to take effect in calendar year (CY) 2026, pending legal review.“The trade is expected to double from current levels within the next 5-6 years, driven by the FTA between India and the UK,” the report said, as quoted by news agency ANI.The FTA, finalised on May 6 after three years of negotiations, marks a major milestone in bilateral economic relations. Under the agreement, India will reduce tariffs on 90 per cent of British goods, with 85 per cent becoming duty-free over the next decade. In return, the UK will eliminate tariffs on 99 per cent of Indian exports, including textiles.Currently, India-UK trade accounts for just 2 per cent of India’s total trade, reflecting significant untapped potential. India is the UK’s 12th-largest trading partner and ranks fifth in apparel and home textiles imports.In calendar year 2024, the UK imported textiles worth $1.4 billionfrom India, making up 6.6 per cent of its total textile imports.While the US and European Union remained the top destinations for Indian apparel and home textiles—accounting for 61 per cent of exports in CY2024—the UK’s share has held steady at 7-8 per cent. However, this is projected to rise to 11-12 per cent by CY2027, representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11 per cent from CY2024 to CY2027.At present, the UK imposes an 8-12 per cent duty on Indian textile imports. The FTA’s implementation, which will eliminate duties on nearly all Indian textile products, is expected to drive investment in additional production capacity over the next 4-5 years.In 2024, China led UK apparel and home textile imports with a 25 per cent market share, followed by Bangladesh (22 per cent), Turkey (8 per cent), and Pakistan (6.8 per cent). India’s new duty-free access will place it on par with competitors such as Bangladesh, Vietnam, and Pakistan, which already benefit from preferential trade terms with the UK.","India-UK trade accounts for just 2 per cent of India’s total trade, reflecting significant untapped potential.

"Forced to destroy! US rejects 15 mango shipments from India, exporters estimate losses of $500,000",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/forced-to-destroy-us-rejects-15-mango-shipments-from-india-exporters-estimate-losses-of-500000/articleshow/121245665.cms,"United States is India's primary export destination for mangoes. (AI image)

Mango Shipments to US rejected

US authorities have rejected no fewer than 15 mango shipments from India at various airports, including Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Atlanta, due to documentation irregularities. The exporters faced the choice of either destroying the fruit in the US or sending it back to India. Given the perishable nature of mangoes and the substantial costs involved in return shipping, all exporters opted to dispose of the mango shipments locally.The United States represents India's primary export destination for mangoes, making these incidents particularly significant for the trade relationship.Considering mangoes are perishable and the substantial expenses linked to destruction or re-exportation, traders anticipate losses of around $500,000.The mangoes had undergone the required irradiation process in Mumbai on May 8 and 9. However, according to an ET report US officials found inconsistencies in the documentation related to this mandatory treatment, which involves exposing the fruit to controlled radiation doses to eliminate pests and prolong shelf life. The issue stemmed from administrative errors in the pest-control documentation rather than actual pest presence, the report said. USDA communication to an affected exporter indicated that US Customs and Border Protection refused entry ""due to incorrectly issued PPQ203."" The notice specified that the shipment ""must be re-exported or destroyed,"" whilst clarifying that the US government would not bear costs for ""remedial measures for this shipment.""The irradiation procedure takes place at a facility situated in Navi Mumbai, overseen by a US Department of Agriculture (USDA) representative. This official is tasked with validating the PPQ203 form, which is essential for mango exports to the US. ""We are being penalised for mistakes made at the irradiation facility,"" an exporter said.Also Read | Why India can be a big winner of Donald Trump 2.0 era if it plays its cards right Another exporter, whose consignment was detained at Los Angeles airport during May 9-11, before receiving destruction orders, was notified that the shipment failed to satisfy the ""entry requirement,"" specifically regarding the mandatory irradiation treatment.The exporter firmly denied the allegation, asserting that the irradiation procedure was completed and the PPQ203 form was issued following the treatment. ""How can we receive the form if the treatment was never done? And without that form, issued by none other than the USDA officer, the mangoes couldn't even have been cleared for loading at Mumbai airport,"" he said.When asked about the specifics of the case, including the quantity of affected mangoes and documentation discrepancies, the Agricultural and Processed Food Products Authority (APEDA) chairman's office responded, ""The matter pertains to the shipment of mangoes from USDA approved facility, Maharashtra State Agricultural Marketing Board (MSAMB) located at Vashi, Mumbai. Hence inputs may be sought from them. "" APEDA operates under the ministry of commerce and industry. MSAMB did not provide any response to the email enquiry.Meanwhile, India and US are looking to seal a trade deal soon. US President Donald Trump has claimed that India has offered a deal with 'literally no tariffs'. The first phase of the deal is expected to be completed in the coming months.India aims to enhance two-way trade by seeking tariff reductions from the United States for sectors employing large workforces. These include textiles, gems and jewellery, leather goods, garments, plastics, chemicals, shrimp, oil seeds, chemicals, grapes, and bananas under the proposed trade agreement.The United States, in return, seeks reduced duties across various sectors including industrial products, automobiles (specifically electric vehicles), wines, petrochemical products, dairy items, agricultural produce such as apples, and tree nuts.Also Read | Donald Trump says India has offered a trade deal with ‘literally no tariffs’","Mango shipments to US rejected at Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Atlanta airports.

NEW DELHI: Tata Steel aims to cut costs by Rs 11,500 crore across its global operations over the next 12–18 months, focusing on controllable expenses, Executive Director and CFO Koushik Chatterjee said during a post-earnings analyst call.Building on structural cost savings of Rs 6,600 crore achieved in FY25, the company is intensifying its cost transformation drive. The measures so far have included fixed cost rationalisation, manufacturing efficiency gains, raw material optimisation, procurement enhancements, and overhead reductions.“Looking ahead to FY2026, our focus continues to be on controllable factors, and we are targeting further cost takeouts of almost Rs 11,500 crore—roughly about $1.3 billion—across geographies,” Chatterjee said, as quoted by news agency PTI.The push for leaner operations comes as Tata Steel expands its Kalinganagar plant and advances its transition to greener steelmaking in the UK and the Netherlands, both of which involve workforce restructuring.In the March quarter (Q4 FY25), Tata Steel reduced its consolidated expenses to Rs 54,167.61 crore, down from Rs 56,496.88 crore a year earlier. Consolidated net profit rose to Rs 1,200.88 crore in the same period.In India, the company is targeting cost savings of Rs 4,000 crore in FY26 through operational improvements, workforce productivity, and supply chain optimisation. It also plans to reduce conversion costs by Rs 1,000–1,200 per tonne.The UK operations aim to cut fixed costs by 29 per cent year-on-year- approximately 220 million pounds. Fixed costs have already declined from 995 million pounds in FY24 to 762 million pounds in FY25, with a target of 540 million pounds for FY26.The UK government has pledged 500 million pounds to support Tata Steel’s shift to electric arc furnace technology. Tata Steel has finalised planning approvals, identified technology partners, and advanced design engineering, with 35 million pounds spent in FY25.The Port Talbot facility in the UK, which has a capacity of 3 million tonnes per annum (MTPA), currently employs about 8,000 people across Tata Steel’s UK operations.In the Netherlands, Tata Steel is targeting cost savings of 500 million pounds through enhanced production efficiency, cost control, and product mix optimisation. The IJmuiden facility produced 6.75 MTPA of liquid steel in FY25.Talks are ongoing with trade unions and the Dutch government regarding the decarbonisation transition and financial support for the planned transformation.Tata Steel has allocated Rs 15,000 crore in capital expenditure for FY26, with 80 per cent earmarked for Indian operations. As of March 2025, the company’s net debt stood at Rs 82,579 crore- down Rs 6,200 crore from Rs 88,870 crore in September 2024.","Tata Steel aims to cut costs by Rs 11,500 crore across its global operations over the next 12–18 months.

NEW DELHI: India and the European Union have concluded the 11th round of negotiations on their proposed Free Trade Agreement (FTA), reportedly agreeing to pursue a two-stage approach to finalise the deal, an official source, quoted by news agency PTI confirmed on Sunday.""The 11th round of talks concluded on May 16,"" the official said, quoted by news agency PTI. This comes amid rising global trade uncertainties, particularly in light of US tariff policies under President Donald Trump . In response, both sides have opted for a phased strategy, similar to India's previous trade pacts with Australia and ongoing discussions with the US.Negotiators focused on key areas such as market access for goods, services, and investment. Commerce Secretary Sunil Barthwal had earlier explained the rationale behind the phased approach, saying, ""If some of the issues which may not be very core to the trade, maybe taking some more time, then it is better to focus on core trade issues. So, we say that first things first...We are also discussing with the EU what can be the early harvest of the first tranche, where we can do faster. ""The EU has sought significant tariff reductions on products including automobiles, medical devices, wines, spirits, meat, and poultry, as well as stronger intellectual property protections.A successful agreement is expected to enhance India’s export competitiveness to the EU in sectors like ready-made garments, pharmaceuticals, steel, petroleum products, and electrical machinery.C ommerce and Industry minister Piyush Goyal reviewed progress during his visit to Brussels on May 1. Talks resumed in June 2022 after an eight-year hiatus, following a breakdown in 2013 over market access concerns.Prime Minister Narendra Modi and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen committed on February 28 to conclude the agreement by the end of 2025.The negotiations span 23 policy areas, including trade in goods and services, investment protection, customs procedures, technical barriers, intellectual property rights, and sustainable development.In 2023–24, EU-India bilateral goods trade stood at $137.41 billion, with Indian exports valued at $75.92 billion and imports at $61.48 billion- making the EU India’s largest trading partner in goods.

What are originating summons?

MUMBAI: Mohini Mohan Dutta , a confidant of Ratan Tata and an erstwhile director at the Taj hotels group , has consented to the terms of the late industrialist’s will, which left him one-third of Tata’s residual estate valued at around Rs 588 crore.His consent expedites the process for the will’s executors to obtain a probate from the Bombay High Court . Dutta, 77, was the only one among the two dozen beneficiaries of Tata’s Rs 3,900-crore estate who questioned the value of his bequest.The remaining two-thirds of Tata’s residual estate (excluding shares and immovable properties) will go to his half-sisters, Shireen Jejeebhoy, 72, and Deanna Jejeebhoy, 70, who are also the executors of the will.Though Dutta initially disagreed with the executors, he was unable to challenge the will due to a no-contest clause in it. Any beneficiary who disputes the will stands to lose all rights. When contacted, Dutta declined to comment.The executors filed a petition to probate the will on March 27. The court recently directed them to issue a public notice and invite objections from non-consenting legal heirs. The executors also filed originating summons on April 9 to move the process forward (see graphic).Dutta is the only non-Tata family member to be bequeathed such a large share of the estate. He wanted to inspect some precious articles left to him, like a Ganesh idol, but was denied access to Tata’s Halekai residence in Colaba, said a source. Tata’s assets are under the supervision of the executors, the source added.Once the court probates Tata’s will, Dutta will not have to pay any estate tax as the receipt of a bequest is not taxable in India.Dutta and Tata had a relationship that extended over six decades. They first met at the Dealers Hostel in Jamshedpur when Dutta was 13 and Tata was 25, according to the former. Subsequently, Dutta relocated to Mumbai, residing at Tata’s Bakhtawar residence in Colaba. Dutta acknowledged that Tata “really built me up”.Dutta began his career at Taj’s travel desk. He then founded Stallion Travel Services in 1986 with funding from Tata Industries. Stallion’s memorandum of association, reviewed by TOI, showed Dutta’s residential address as Bakhtawar. During that period, Tata companies were directed to utilise Stallion for their travel arrangements.In 2006, Stallion was merged with a Taj subsidiary and Dutta became a director of the merged entity, Inditravel. He was one of Taj’s top earning executives. In 2015, the travel services business was transferred to Tata Capital, which then sold it to Thomas Cook India in 2017. Dutta retained his board position until 2019, when the business was merged into Thomas Cook.","Mohini Mohan Dutta, a confidant of Ratan Tata, has consented to the terms of the late industrialist's will.

Asian stock markets slid on Monday and the US dollar weakened after Moody’s downgraded the United States’ last remaining triple-A sovereign credit rating, triggering renewed investor concerns about Washington’s rising debt burden.Moody’s cut the rating from Aaa to Aa1, citing “the increase over more than a decade in government debt and interest payment ratios to levels that are significantly higher than similarly rated sovereigns.” It warned US deficits could swell to nearly 9% of GDP by 2035, up from 6.4% last year, driven by ballooning interest payments, entitlement spending, and relatively weak revenue.The downgrade follows similar moves by S&P in 2011 and Fitch in 2023. Analysts noted the cut could increase yields on US Treasuries, raising borrowing costs for the federal government.Despite the development, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent downplayed the move, calling it “a lagging indicator” and blaming the previous administration. “We didn't get here in the past 100 days,” he told CNN. “It's the Biden administration and the spending that we have seen over the past four years that we inherited, 6.7 percent deficit-to-GDP, the highest when we weren't in a recession, not in a war.”White House communications director Steven Cheung also lashed out on social media, targeting Moody’s Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi. “Nobody takes his ‘analysis’ seriously. He has been proven wrong time and time again,” Cheung posted on X.The timing of the downgrade was politically sensitive, as President Donald Trump’s proposed tax and welfare bill failed to pass in Congress. Independent analysts estimate the package could have added over $4.8 trillion to the deficit over 10 years. Several Republican fiscal hawks opposed the legislation, prompting House Speaker Mike Johnson to promise another vote later this week.The financial markets, which had enjoyed gains last week after the US and China agreed to temporarily reduce trade tariffs, reacted swiftly. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng dropped 0.6% to 23,211.29, while Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 slipped 0.4% to 37,617.63. Shanghai’s Composite fell 0.2% to 3,361.55. Other markets in Seoul, Singapore, Sydney, Wellington, Taipei and Jakarta also closed lower. US futures were also down.Chinese retail data added to the gloom. April’s retail sales growth came in below expectations at 5.1%, reinforcing concerns over domestic demand despite recent stimulus measures. However, factory output showed some resilience with better-than-expected figures.Gold, benefiting from safe-haven demand, rose to $3,225 per ounce. The dollar slipped against major currencies, trading at 145.09 yen, while the euro rose to $1.1180.Still, some analysts believe the market impact of the downgrade will be limited. “Moody’s actions will have zero impact on any investor's ability or willingness to continue holding US Treasuries — that would likely require downgrades of four or five more notches,” said Ray Attrill of National Australia Bank.Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management added, “Moody’s may have dropped the mic, but for equity traders, the real test this week will be Main Street… the downgrade is more psychological than mechanical.”Key earnings from major US retailers like Target, Home Depot, and Lowe’s are expected later this week and could provide further insight into consumer strength amid economic uncertainty.","Moody’s cut the rating from Aaa to Aa1, citing “the increase over more than a decade in government debt and interest payment ratios to levels that are significantly higher than similarly rated sovereigns” It warned US deficits could swell to nearly 9% of GDP by 2035, up from 6.4% last year, driven by ballooning interest payments, entitlement spending, and relatively weak revenue.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121259473,imgsize-1380425,width-400,resizemode-4/121259473.jpg"

Can rally sustain?

MUMBAI: The trading pattern of foreign fund managers, developments on India-US trade deal , direction of the rupee-dollar exchange rate after Moody’s downgrade of US’s credit rating on Saturday, and quarterly numbers from large corporates will dictate the direction of the domestic market in the new week.The previous week saw a strong rally in largecap stocks and an even stronger one in midcap and smallcap stocks. The sensex rallied about 3.6% to close the week at 82,331 points, while the Nifty added 4.2% to settle at 25,020 points. The week also saw BSE’s smallcap index gain 9.2%, while the midcap index was up 6.9%.Over the weekend, US President Donald Trump repeated that India and the US will soon have a trade deal that will allow zero-tariff trades for some commodities. Market players are keenly watching developments on that front.In addition, investors will continue to monitor foreign capital flows that played a significant role in sustaining the current rally, said Ajit Mishra of Religare Broking. Trading trends by domestic funds will also be watched, others said.Last week, foreign funds net bought Indian stocks worth about Rs 15,000 crore, while domestic funds net infused Rs 9,557 crore, data from BSE and NSDL showed.According to Vinod Nair of Geojit Investments, market players will look at the potential resolution of other major geopolitical conflicts and easing trade disruptions, which could further support global equity markets. “Both FIIs and DIIs have been consistently buying into the market, reinforcing the upward trajectory. Global investors displayed a heightened risk appetite, shifting capital away from traditional safe-haven assets such as gold and US treasuries, reflecting a renewed sense of market confidence. ”Market players are also looking at sector and stock-specific plays. According to Mishra, with all major sectors participating in the rally on a rotational basis, stock selection based on a favourable risk-reward profile remains critical.“In particular, thematic plays like defence and railways, which have shown exceptional performance in recent weeks, may continue to offer opportunities.”The week is set to see some of the large corporates announce their quarterly numbers, which in turn could lead to some traction in those stocks. This week, among others, ONGC, ITC, Hindalco, JSW Steel, and Power Grid are set to announce their Jan-March quarterly results.Market players would also watch out for any impact of Moody’s ratings downgrade of the US, the last major ratings agency to do this for the world’s largest economy.","The previous week saw a strong rally in largecap stocks and an even stronger one in midcap and smallcap stocks.

BENGALURU: Zoho founder and CEO Sridhar Vembu cautioned software professionals against assuming continued dominance in the job market, warning that emerging technologies like large language models (LLMs) and advanced development tooling could “destroy a lot of software jobs .”In a post on X, Vembu said, “The fact that software engineers get paid better than mechanical engineers or civil engineers or chemists or school teachers is not some birthright, and we cannot take that for granted, and we cannot assume it will last forever.”He reminded that even customer demand is contingent: “The fact that customers pay for our products also cannot be taken for granted.” Vembu underscored the risk of complacency, quoting Intel’s Andy Grove, “Only the paranoid survive.”The remarks come amid a broader shift in the software industry, where rapid advancements in generative AI are automating routine coding tasks. While companies are investing in AI to boost productivity, there are growing concerns about its implications on traditional engineering roles. Vembu previously voiced concerns about AI’s impact on employment and advocated for greater humility and adaptability in the tech sector.“The productivity revolution I see coming to software development (LLMs + tooling) could destroy a lot of software jobs.This is sobering but necessary to internalise,” he said in the post.The Zoho chief’s comments add to a chorus of voices from the industry calling for recalibration of skills in light of AI-led disruption, particularly in white-collar domains. As enterprise software firms increasingly integrate AI into development workflows, industry experts told TOI that the shift could alter the structure of engineering teams and recalibrate entry-level hiring.",Zoho founder and CEO Sridhar Vembu cautioned software professionals against assuming continued dominance in the job market.

These GCCs initially planned for 70,000 positions, with individual centres targeting between 50 to 3,000 roles.A recent Nasscom-Zinnov report showed that India has over 480 mid-market GCCs , with 210,000 professionals employed. Mid-market GCCs are capability centres set up by mid-sized firms with annual revenue ranging from $100 million to $1 billion. They represent 27% of all GCCs and 22% of total GCC units in the country. In the last five years alone, more than 110 new facilities were established, representing approximately 35% of all new GCC units in India within this period.This contrasts with the larger GCCs in terms of operational scale but not in the ability to deliver high-quality services and innovation.India will be home to over 120 new mid-market GCCs by 2026, according to research by Bengaluru and US-based ANSR. The majority of mid-tier GCCs in India originate from North America (60%). European nations contribute 25% of these centres, led by Germany, the UK, Ireland, Spain, and France.The Asia-Pacific region, including Australia, New Zealand, Japan, and Singapore, accounts for 10% of these establishments. Some of the mid-market GCCs that entered India in the last 2-3 years include Revolut, Papa Johns, Raksul, and Outbrain, among others.These centres are primarily situated in Bengaluru, Hyderabad, and Pune. Kedar Pathak, GCC talent specialist at Xpheno, said that tier-1 locations provide superior talent availability, varied skill sets, and facilities. Although tier-2 locations are preparing for future growth, they remain secondary choices for GCC establishments. Modern GCCs have evolved beyond technological hubs to encompass diverse business operations.","India witnessed over 140 greenfield GCCs come up during the past 30 months.

Average year-on-year reduction in sales

CHENNAI: Despite reduction of unsold stock inventory and signs of recovery in the affordable housing segment, it has not enthused developers. Poor conversion rates, spiralling construction costs and unsustainable margins are posing a grave challenge to the affordable housing market.This has resulted in several developers keeping away from launching new projects in the segment. Their reluctance is despite a huge opportunity in this space over the next five years. A report by CII and Knight Frank has projected the cumulative affordable housing demand to reach 31.2 million units with an estimated market size of Rs 67 trillion by 2030.Anarock research has found that unsold inventory in the affordable housing segment (<Rs 40 lakh) fell by 19% across the top seven cities in the past one year. It has decreased from 1.4 lakh units in Q1 (Jan-March) CY2024 to a little over 1.1 lakh units during Q1 CY2025. “This trend of declining unsold stock is likely to continue in the upcoming quarters as well,” said Anuj Puri, chairman — Anarock Group. At the same time, the sales share of affordable housing units has plunged to 20% in CY2024 from the figure of 39% four years ago.P Suresh, MD of Chennai-based affordable housing developer Arun Excello said, 90% of developers have shifted out of the affordable housing segment post-Covid in Tamil Nadu.“The pandemic impacted lower salaried employees, who were the core customers of affordable housing. Also, govt’s incentives for affordable housing homebuyers were withdrawn. Subsequently, those buying properties for the purpose of rentals did not pursue their interests,” he said.The company still continues with affordable housing projects around the city. Affordable housing units are those with a carpet area of up to 60 sq m in metropolitan cities and 90 sq m for non-metropolitan cities that are priced less than Rs 45 lakh.","Poor conversion rates, spiralling construction costs and unsustainable margins are posing a grave challenge to the affordable housing market.

'Lagging indicator': US treasury secretary blames Biden-era spending for Moody’s credit downgrade,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/lagging-indicator-us-treasury-secretary-blames-biden-era-spending-for-moodys-credit-downgrade/articleshow/121251688.cms,"US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent (File photo)

NEW DELHI: US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Sunday dismissed Moody’s decision to downgrade the country’s credit rating, calling it “a lagging indicator” and attributing the development to fiscal policies under the Biden administration.Speaking on CNN, Bessent said the downgrade, which stripped the US of its final triple-A credit rating, reflected spending patterns from the previous four years. “We didn’t get here in the past 100 days,” he said, adding, “It’s the Biden administration and the spending that we have seen over the past four years that we inherited—6.7 per cent deficit-to-GDP, the highest when we weren’t in a recession, not in a war.”Bessent argued that the fiscal strain had been years in the making, citing the inherited deficit-to-GDP ratio as the most severe in peacetime or outside a recession.Moody’s announcement on Friday, however, pointed to broader concerns, including a sustained rise in federal debt levels spanning multiple administrations. The agency projected federal deficits would grow to nearly nine per cent of GDP by 2035, driven by mounting interest payments, rising entitlement costs, and insufficient revenue.Despite the downgrade, Bessent said the current administration was committed to fiscal responsibility . “We are determined to bring the spending down and grow the economy,” he said, maintaining that growth would ultimately outpace debt accumulation.Moody’s had been the last of the three major ratings agencies to maintain a triple-A rating for the US. S&P downgraded its rating in 2011, followed by Fitch in 2023.The credit rating cut comes amid economic uncertainty in Washington. President Donald Trump ’s proposal to extend his 2017 tax cuts—estimated at around $5 trillion—suffered a major setback after failing to clear a key vote in Congress.The plan faced opposition from Republican fiscal conservatives, who blocked its advancement, casting doubt on the bill’s future in the House of Representatives.Reacting to the downgrade, Republican Congressman French Hill, who chairs the House Financial Services Committee, said Moody’s move was a stark warning about the country’s fiscal trajectory. “This is a clear signal of the nation’s growing financial instability,” he said.","Moody’s had been the last of the three major ratings agencies to maintain a triple-A rating for the US.

"Global layoff spree: Microsoft, Amazon, Burberry among firms cutting jobs; thousands affected",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/global-layoff-spree-microsoft-amazon-burberry-among-firms-cutting-thousands-of-jobs/articleshow/121247440.cms,"Microsoft: Over 6,000 jobs slashed in structural overhaul

Amazon: Cuts in services and services sector

Panasonic: 10,000 jobs to go amid structural reforms

PwC: 1,500 US employees let go after business review

CrowdStrike: 5% workforce cut despite strong growth

Burberry: 1,700 jobs cut in bid to revive brand

In recent weeks, several multinational corporations across sectors, from technology and cybersecurity to fashion and consulting, have announced significant job cuts, impacting tens of thousands of workers globally. These layoffs are being driven by structural overhauls, cost-cutting strategies, and a sharper focus on profitability. Together, they signal a broader industry shift toward consolidation, leaner operations, and streamlined efficiency.Microsoft is laying off approximately 3% of its global workforce, affecting over 6,000 employees across departments and regions. The company, which had 228,000 staff as of June 2023, said that the move is aimed at streamlining operations and reducing management layers.The cuts mark the biggest reduction since Microsoft eliminated 10,000 jobs in 2023. However, unlike earlier performance-based layoffs, these are structural, targeting middle management to widen the span of control per manager. Coders and engineering staff are expected to be largely spared, as the company continues to prioritise AI investments.Microsoft also introduced stricter performance policies, including a two-year rehire ban for underperformers and a “good attrition” metric to track desirable exits. Employees placed on a performance improvement plan (PIP) must choose within five days or forgo severance.Amazon reportedly fired around 100 employees from its devices and services division, which develops hardware like Echo, Fire TV, and Ring. The layoffs are part of an internal review to better align teams with product roadmaps and improve overall efficiency.“As part of our ongoing work to make our teams and programs operate more efficiently, and to better align with our product roadmap, we’ve made the difficult decision to eliminate a small number of roles,” an Amazon spokesperson told Reuters.CEO Andy Jassy has also been vocal about reducing bureaucracy and management layers, recently informing about a 15% increase in the ratio of individual contributors to managers. He also stressed upon the importance of meritocracy over bureaucracy in Amazon's corporate culture, encouraging staff to do more with fewer resources.Panasonic is cutting 10,000 jobs, 4% of its global workforce, through the fiscal year ending March 2026. Half of the cuts will be in Japan, with the rest overseas. The layoffs are aimed at restructuring unprofitable divisions, particularly in consumer electronics.“Compared with industry peers that have already moved ahead with structural reforms, our selling, general and administrative expenses ratio remains exceptionally high,” said President Yuki Kusumi during a media briefing.The company will also merge sales and back-office functions to reduce fixed costs and may exit or sell off underperforming segments, including its struggling TV business. Panasonic expects to take an earnings hit of 130 billion yen (~$894 million) due to the restructuring.PwC has laid off about 2% of its US workforce, around 1,500 employees, mainly from its audit and tax teams, following an internal review. Many affected staff had joined only recently, and some were reportedly up for promotion before receiving layoff notices via surprise “time-sensitive” Teams meeting invites.“This was a difficult decision, and we made it with care, thoughtfulness and a deep awareness of its impact on our people,” PwC said in a statement, citing historically low attrition rates as a contributing factor.The firm also plans to cut back on campus hiring but will honour offers already extended to interns. Other Big Four firms, including Deloitte and KPMG, have recently implemented similar cuts in response to slowing demand and low staff turnover.Cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike is laying off 5% of its global workforce, around 500 roles, as part of a strategic realignment despite reporting a 25% year-on-year revenue increase to $1.06 billion in the last quarter.“While we will continue to prudently hire, primarily in customer-facing and product engineering roles, we are reducing roles in some areas of the business,” CEO George Kurtz said in a note to employees.The company is targeting $10 billion in annual recurring revenue and plans to continue hiring in key strategic areas through 2026. It expects to incur up to $53 million in restructuring-related charges.British luxury fashion house Burberry is laying off 1,700 employees, almost 20% of its global workforce, in a sweeping cost-saving move under new CEO Joshua Schulman. Most cuts will affect office-based staff, and the Castleford trench coat factory will lose its night shift due to overproduction.“Our brand metrics have all shown a significant improvement in the second half versus the first half,” Schulman told reporters, expressing cautious optimism.The company reported better-than-expected profits of £26 million for FY25, though sales dipped 6% in the final quarter amid a sluggish luxury market. Schulman, Burberry’s fourth CEO in a decade, is pivoting the brand back to its heritage products while trimming underperforming divisions and refocusing on high-margin leather goods.","Microsoft is laying off approximately 3% of its global workforce, affecting over 6,000 employees across departments and regions.

SAN FRANCISCO: A mix of democratic and republican state attorneys on Friday called on Congress to reject a moratorium on regulating artificial intelligence included in US President Donald Trump's tax bill.Top attorneys representing 40 states signed a letter urging leaders in Congress to reject the AI regulation moratorium language added to the budget reconciliation bill ""The impact of such a broad moratorium would be sweeping and wholly destructive of reasonable state efforts to prevent known harms associated with AI,"" the letter states.""This bill will affect hundreds of existing and pending state laws passed and considered by both republican and democratic state legislatures.""The amendment added by the house energy and commerce committee to the budget reconciliation bill imposes a 10-year prohibition on states from enforcing any state regulation addressing AI or ""automated decision-making systems,"" according to the state attorneys.""The amendment added to the reconciliation bill abdicates federal leadership and mandates that all states abandon their leadership in this area as well,"" the state attorneys general wrote.""This bill does not propose any regulatory scheme to replace or supplement the laws enacted or currently under consideration by the states, leaving Americans entirely unprotected from the potential harms of AI.""The letter notes that states have put in place laws designed to protect against AI-generated porn, deepfakes intended to mislead voters, and spam calls or text messages.Some state laws have also been crafted to prevent biases in AI models.""These laws and their regulations have been developed over years through careful consideration and extensive stakeholder input from consumers, industry, and advocates,"" the letter read. Republican fiscal hawks on Friday sunk a key vote on advancing the mega-bill that is the centerpiece of Trump's domestic agenda, in a significant setback for the US president's tax and spending policies.Trump is pushing to usher into law his so-called ""One Big, Beautiful Bill"" pairing an extension of his first-term tax cuts with savings that will see millions of the poorest Americans lose their health care coverage.But a congressional republican party rife with divisions and competition within its rank-and-file has complicated the process, raising serious doubts that the sprawling package can pass a vote of the full House of Representatives next week.The budget committee's no vote is not the final word on the package, which will be reworked and sent back to the panel for more debate starting 10 pm on Sunday (0200 GMT Monday) and a fresh vote.",Top attorneys representing 40 states signed a letter urging leaders in Congress to reject the AI regulation moratorium language.

Moody’s strips US of last triple-A credit rating over soaring debt: What it means for Trump,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/moodys-strips-us-of-last-triple-a-credit-rating-over-soaring-debt-what-it-means-for-trump/articleshow/121225901.cms,"Moody's Investors Service

The United States lost its final top-tier credit rating on Friday as Moody’s Investors Service downgraded the country’s long-held Aaa rating to Aa1, citing ballooning government debt and persistent deficits.The move undermines President Donald Trump's economic narrative just as his flagship spending bill faces setbacks in Congress.The downgrade coincided with the failure of Trump’s proposed multi-trillion dollar tax and spending legislation to pass a key vote, stalled by Republican fiscal conservatives.Moody’s decision follows similar downgrades by S&P in 2011 and Fitch in 2023, leaving the United States without a single triple-A rating from the major credit rating agencies.Explaining its rationale, Moody’s said the shift was due to “the increase over more than a decade in government debt and interest payment ratios to levels that are significantly higher than similarly rated sovereigns.”The agency projected federal deficits will rise to nearly 9% of GDP by 2035—up from 6.4% in 2023—driven largely by surging interest costs, entitlement spending, and limited revenue growth. As a consequence, US federal debt is expected to reach 134% of GDP by 2035, up from 98% last year.In response, the White House defended its fiscal record, and campaign communications director Steven Cheung lashed out at Moody’s Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi. “Nobody takes his 'analysis' seriously. He has been proven wrong time and time again,” Cheung posted on X.Moody’s noted the downgrade reflected Washington’s repeated inability to address structural fiscal challenges. “Successive US administrations and Congress have failed to agree on measures to reverse the trend of large annual fiscal deficits and growing interest costs,” the agency said, adding, “We do not believe that material multi-year reductions in mandatory spending and deficits will result from current fiscal proposals under consideration. ”While Moody’s outlook was revised from “negative” to “stable,” it warned the nation’s fiscal standing is weakening “relative to its own past and compared to other highly-rated sovereigns.”Congressman French Hill, chair of the house financial services committee, called the downgrade “a strong reminder that our nation's fiscal house is not in order,” pledging that republicans would work to “restore fiscal stability, address the structural drivers of our debt, and foster a pro-growth economic environment.”The timing of the downgrade is politically charged. Trump’s proposed “big, beautiful” spending bill which includes a $5 trillion extension of his 2017 tax cuts and controversial reductions to Medicaid is a cornerstone of his campaign messaging on economic stewardship.Despite the downgrade, Moody’s acknowledged US economic strengths, saying the country “retains exceptional credit strengths such as the size, resilience and dynamism of its economy and the role of the US dollar as global reserve currency.”",Moody's Investors Service downgraded the country’s long-held Aaa rating to Aa1.

US consumer sentiment falls for fifth month driven by inflation fears,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-consumer-sentiment-falls-for-fifth-month-amid-inflation-fears/articleshow/121217699.cms,"AI-generated image

Consumer sentiment in the United States fell for the fifth straight month in May, driven by growing concerns over inflation linked to President Donald Trump 's trade policies.According to preliminary data from the University of Michigan , the consumer sentiment index dropped by 2.7 per cent to 50.8- its lowest level since June 2022 and nearly 30 per cent below its January reading. The decline contradicts economists’ expectations of stabilization.The drop reflects rising anxiety over inflation, fueled by Trump’s aggressive tariff strategy. Although recent trade talks led to a reduction in US tariffs on Chinese goods, from 145 per cent to 30 per cent, current rates remain historically high. In return, China agreed to lower duties on US exports from 125 per cent to 10 per cent.People became more concerned about the escalating cost of living as inflation expectations surge. The Michigan survey found that consumers anticipate inflation to hit 7.3 per cent over the next year, the highest since 1981, up from 6.5 per cent last month. The five-year inflation outlook rose to 4.6 per cent- its highest since 1991.The Michigan survey, conducted from April 22 to May 13, only partially reflected the impact of the US-China tariff reductions announced on May 11.Meanwhile actual inflation fell to 2.3 per cent last month, a four-year low, thus, the Federal Reserve officials remain cautious. Persistent inflation expectations may delay any interest rate cuts, as they risk becoming self-fulfilling through wage demands and price hikes.Fed Chair Jerome Powell had previously called these consumer projections an “outlier,” but their steady climb may influence monetary policy decisions.","The consumer sentiment index dropped by 2.7 per cent to 50.8- its lowest level since June 2022.

Danish pharmaceutical giant Novo Nordisk , maker of popular weight-loss drug Ozempic , announced on Friday that CEO Lars Fruergaard Jorgensen will step down, citing ongoing ""market challenges"" and a significant drop in the company’s share value.The board and Jorgensen reached a mutual decision to initiate a leadership transition. He will remain in his role temporarily to ""support a smooth transition to new leadership"", according to the company.“The changes are, however, made in light of the recent market challenges Novo Nordisk has been facing, and the development of the company’s share price since mid-2024,” the company said in a statement. The board and Jorgensen “have jointly concluded that initiating a CEO succession is in the best interest of the company and its shareholders,"" it added.The decision comes as Novo Nordisk grapples with a sharp decline in its stock price- down more than 50 per cent since June 2024. This was after the stock value had experienced a dramatic surge following the launch of both Wegovy and the diabetes medication Ozempic, with both products containing semaglutide as their primary active component.Then, sShares fell a further three per cent on the Copenhagen exchange following Friday's CEO exit announcement.The company recently downgraded its annual sales growth projection, adjusting the forecast from 16-24 per cent to 13-21 per cent. The revision is attributed to rising competition, particularly from compounded versions of its GLP-1 drugs Wegovy and Ozempic, produced in American pharmacies during a recent supply shortage.However, the US regulators, even though had declared the shortage over in February and ordered an end to compounding, the impact continues to be felt. Novo Nordisk stated it is “actively focused on preventing unlawful and unsafe compounding.”The firm also faces increasing pressure from US rival Eli Lilly , whose weight-loss injection Zepbound is gaining traction in the same market. A research paper published in the New England Journal of Medicine on Sunday revealed that individuals achieved greater weight reduction whilst using Eli Lilly's rival medication Zepbound.Additionally, the announcement of successful clinical trials for Eli Lilly's diabetes and obesity medication orforglipron caused Novo Nordisk's share prices to decline significantly last month.Diabetes affects more than 10 percent of people globally, and treatments for this condition remain central to Novo Nordisk's pharmaceutical operations. The International Diabetes Federation projects a 46 percent rise in adult diabetes cases by 2045.Additionally, the World Obesity Federation anticipates that by 2035, obesity and overweight conditions will affect over 50 percent of global population, potentially resulting in annual economic consequences exceeding $4 trillion.","Lars Fruergaard Jorgensen will step down as CEO of Danish pharmaceutical giant Novo Nordisk.

"Japan's economy shrinks in the first quarter, dragged by US tariff tensions",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/japans-economy-shrinks-in-the-first-quarter-dragged-by-us-tariff-tensions/articleshow/121214892.cms,"The Japanese economy took a hit for the first time in a year, weighed down by fragile domestic demand and trade tensions with the US. Preliminary government data released on Friday showed that the gross domestic product (GDP) fell at an annualised rate of 0.7% in the January-March quarter, significantly worse than the market’s forecast for a 0.2% drop. On a quarterly basis, GDP contracted 0.2%, double the expected 0.1% decline.The downturn was largely driven by flat private consumption, which makes up more than half of Japan's economic output, and a sharp drop in exports indicating that the economy was losing support from external demand even before US President Donald Trump announced reciprocal tariffs on April 2.According to a Reuters report, analysts warned that the situation could worsen once the full impact of tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump begins to bite.“Japan’s economy lacks a driver of growth given weakness in exports and consumption. It’s very vulnerable to shocks such as one from Trump tariffs,” said Yoshiki Shinke, senior executive economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute.“The data may lead to growing calls for bigger fiscal spending,” he added, warning that another contraction in the second quarter cannot be ruled out.While there were some bright spots like capital spending rising by 1.4%, and fourth-quarter GDP growth being revised up slightly to 2.4% external demand was a major drag.Exports fell by 0.6% while imports rose 2.9%, shaving 0.8 percentage point off growth.The GDP deflator rose 3.3% year-on-year, showing that companies are passing on rising costs. Still, that hasn’t been enough to lift overall momentum, especially as uncertainty looms over Japan’s key automobile sector, a major export engine.Japanese automakers are already feeling the pressure amid uncertain trade tensions. Toyota expected its profit to drop by a fifth in the current financial year. US President Trump announced a 10% tariff on all countries except for Canada, Mexico and China alongside higher tariffs for big trading partners like 24% for Japan. These tariffs are said to take effect from July unless the countries can manage to negotiate a deal with Washington.Japan's economic revitalisation minister Ryosei Akazawa acknowledged the challenges ahead, noting that wage growth could provide some support but trade risks remained a serious concern.“We must be mindful of downside risks to the economy from US tariff policy. The hit to consumption and household sentiment from continued price rises is also a risk to growth,” Akazawa said during a press conference, quoted by Reuters.“The early-year contraction serves as a reminder of Japan’s economic struggles. Tariff pain and weak domestic momentum will weigh on growth in the quarters ahead,” said Stefan Angrick, head of Japan and Frontier Markets Economics at Moody’s Analytics.The weaker data is likely to increase political pressure on Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba to introduce fresh stimulus or tax cuts, though Akazawa insisted no such measures are currently planned.At the same time, the Bank of Japan is navigating its own set of complications. Having raised interest rates to 0.5% in January after ending a decade of ultra-loose policy, the central bank is now under pressure to hold back on further hikes. In early May, it slashed its growth forecasts, citing fears of a global slowdown.Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute, said, “If the impact of Trump tariffs is fairly light, the BOJ could raise interest rates again in September or October. But if the tariffs deal a severe blow to capital spending and exports, rate hikes could be put on hold.”","GDP fell at an annualised rate of 0.7% in the January-March quarter.

Akasa Air is gearing up for a major expansion this fiscal year, after a year of muted growth, buying planes and expanding flight operations to new regions. The low-cost carrier currently contributes 5% to India’s domestic traffic.The airline plans to launch international flights to one of the most sought-after regions for Indian travellers, southeast Asia.However, having only Boeing planes in its fleet, the group has faced challenges to expand operations as the manufacturer has been going through a production slump.Akasa chief commercial officer Praveen Iyer told ET, ""The constraints seem to have been addressed to a large extent. Boeing had a peculiar issue and that's resolved, which is good news.""“The good news is the worst is behind the supply,” Iyer added.He further added that they will be back on track for more deliveries this year, “we are happy with how the deliveries are scheduled for the rest of the year.”In the upcoming months, Akasa is aiming to increase its available seat kilometres, a key measure of airline capacity, by 30–40%.Akasa had initially ordered 72 Boeing 737 Max aircraft in 2022 and later added four more to that order.In January this year, it placed an additional order for 150 aircraft of the same type.However, deliveries were delayed after Boeing faced intensified scrutiny from regulators and airlines following a mid-air incident in January involving a door plug detachment.As the production issues are gradually resolving, Akasa now plans to ramp up its international presence.“We have been consistently adding capacity on the international markets. Over the next several months you will see us making some announcements about addition of flights to Far East destinations,” Iyer said.He also highlighted that the upcoming Noida and Navi Mumbai airports will be game-changers for international connectivity from India’s busiest aviation hubs.",Akasa Air is gearing up for a major expansion this fiscal year.

The Abu Dhabi-based carrier confirmed on Friday that it will buy 28 wide-body Boeing aircraft, all powered by GE engines, as per Reuters.The aircraft, a mix of Boeing 787s and the next-generation 777X – will begin joining Etihad’s fleet from 2028, as the airline looks to modernise and expand its operations. The White House described the deal as a significant boost for US manufacturing and exports “With the inclusion of the next-generation 777X in its fleet plan, the investment deepens the longstanding commercial aviation partnership between the UAE and the United States,” the White House said. “It fuels American manufacturing and drives exports.”Etihad said the order reflects its “ongoing approach to aligning its fleet with evolving network and operational needs.” The airline currently operates a fleet of around 100 aircraft.Etihad CEO Antonoaldo Neves, who has overseen the airline’s growth following a period of restructuring, said last month that the company plans to bring in 20 to 22 new aircraft this year alone. That includes ten Airbus A321LRs, six Airbus A350s, and four Boeing 787s. The A321LRs, unveiled earlier this week, are expected to enter service in August.The airline, which is owned by Abu Dhabi’s $225 billion sovereign wealth fund ADQ, aims to grow its fleet to more than 170 aircraft by 2030, supporting the UAE capital’s wider economic diversification plans.Meanwhile, Boeing also scored another major win this week with a separate deal in the Gulf. During Trump’s visit to Qatar, state carrier Qatar Airways placed firm orders for 160 wide-body jets, with options for 50 more, a deal the White House valued at $96 billion.","US President Donald Trump announced a series of business deals worth more than $200 billion between American companies and the United Arab Emirates.

China's GDP growth to slow down to 4.6% reflecting subdued consumer sentiment: UN report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/chinas-gdp-growth-to-slow-down-to-4-6-reflecting-subdued-consumer-sentiment-un-report/articleshow/121211040.cms,"Global front



The United Nations revised its global economic growth forecast downward to 2.4% for 2025, down from 2.9 in 2024, warning that rising trade tensions, looming policy uncertainty, and geopolitical volatility are weighing down the world economy to a fragile position.The report also showed a slowdown in major economies. In China, the economy is expected to grow at 4.6% from 5% in 2024, dragged down by weak consumer demand, disrupted export-oriented manufacturing and challenges in the property sector.Despite solid growth in the first quarter, net exports are expected to push down the overall growth in 2025 due to tariff-related shocks. However, policy measures introduced in March 2025, aimed at boosting consumption, encouraging investment, and stabilizing the property market are likely to cushion the impact.Recently, in a bid to boost domestic demand amid growing external pressures, the People’s Bank of China cut policy rates. Alongside this, it also launched a more ambitious fiscal expansion, increasing the fiscal deficit from 3% of GDP in 2024 to 4% in 2025, to fund a variety of measures.In the longer term, advancing structural reforms to drive the economy toward domestic consumption remains crucial for sustained resilience.The report showed that unemployment in the country increased modestly during early 2025 and increasing US tariffs were further expected to pressurise the export oriented industries even more.It further said that China, a large economy, has seen wage gains in recent years.The report says that emerging economies such as Brazil, Mexico, and South Africa are also seeing downward revisions, as falling commodity prices and weaker investment weigh on their prospects.According to the report, the global economy remains fragile amid rising trade tensions and policy uncertainty. It also warned that a sharp rise in US tariffs could drive up production costs, disrupt global supply chains, and heighten financial instability.","The United Nations revised its global economic growth forecast downward to 2.4% for 2025, down from 2.9 in 2024.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor ( CEA ) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran Udaan until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.Udaan built an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business still accounts for a very small part of India’s overall retail market but can balloon to $150 billion in sales and yield a 100% return on capital invested in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co. estimates published in the Mint newspaper.Bengaluru-based Udaan has also ventured into financing through its fintech unit which helps shopkeepers get working capital loans to buy inventory. That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says.

Space sector start-up Sisir Radar to develop SAR on L/P band SAR,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/space-sector-start-up-sisir-radar-to-develop-sar-on-l/p-band-sar/articleshow/104558111.cms,"CHENNAI: Space sector startup, Sisir Radar Private Ltd has hit success at the prestigious iDEX DefSpace Challenge with its projects for development of “L/P band Continuous Wave SAR (synthetic aperture radar) payload for LEO Small Satellites” and “Unfurlable, Electronically Steering Antenna for L/P band SAR payload” for Indian Air Force (IAF), said a top company official.The company is promoted by former Director at the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) Tapan Misra and the brains behind the Indian space agency’s RISAT series of SAR satellites as well as the Dual Frequency SAR on the Chandrayaan 2 orbiter that is currently circling the moon.""A grant of Rs 3 crore is also there for development of the products,"" Misra told IANS.Synthetic Aperture Radar or SAR is a special kind of imaging radar technology that can provide extremely accurate high resolution imagery of the terrain through clouds, smoke and dust even in pitch dark conditions. SAR imagery provides much higher resolution than other forms of remote sensing technology such as hyperspectral and multispectral. SAR is a critical technology for strategic reconnaissance and planning as well as for disaster management.According to Misra, winning the challenge in just over a year of floating the company is a major booster.He said L and P band SAR have an advantage over other frequencies (like X band) when it comes to penetration capabilities through rain, clouds, foliage and vegetation in a tropical country like India, and underground penetration capabilities in dry terrain.Continuing further, he said the L band SAR will provide 1 metre resolution, spotlight resolution in Stripmap mode. The current industry standard is 5-10 metre in L band. Misra said both the L and P band will operate simultaneously from a satellite borne SAR. Recently, Sisir Radar successfully developed and tested the world’s highest resolution L-Band SAR fitted on a drone. With 0.2 metre resolution, this is by far the highest L band SAR in the world, he said.","Space sector startup, Sisir Radar Private Ltd has hit success at the prestigious iDEX DefSpace Challenge.

Testify: Sam Bankman-Fried acknowledges 'mistakes' but testifies he did not defraud anyone,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/cryptocurrency/sam-bankman-fried-acknowledges-mistakes-but-testifies-he-did-not-defraud-anyone/articleshow/104761929.cms,"<p>Sam Bankman-Fried (File Photo- Reuters)<br></p>

NEW YORK: Sam Bankman-Fried , testifying in his own defense at his fraud trial on Friday, acknowledged that a ""lot of people got hurt"" when the FTX cryptocurrency exchange he founded collapsed, but said he did not defraud anyone or take customer funds.Shortly after taking the witness stand in Manhattan federal court, Bankman-Fried said he made ""a number of small mistakes and a number of larger mistakes"" while running the now-bankrupt exchange. The biggest mistake, he said, was not implementing a dedicated risk management team.""We thought that we might be able to build the best product on the market,"" Bankman-Fried said. ""It turned out basically the opposite of that. A lot of people got hurt - customers, employees - and the company ended up in bankruptcy.""Prosecutors accuse Bankman-Fried of using FTX customer funds to prop up his crypto-focused hedge fund, Alameda Research, make speculative venture investments and donate more than $100 million to US political campaigns. He also faces charges of scheming to cheat Alameda's lenders and FTX investors.He has pleaded not guiltyBankman-Fried's trial, which began on October 3, is drawing to a close nearly a year after FTX collapsed amid a wave of customer withdrawals. The company declared bankruptcy in November 2022 and Bankman-Fried was indicted the following month.His testimony marked the first time the dozen jurors and five alternates have heard directly from the 31-year-old former billionaire after 12 trial days.Bankman-Fried, who was jailed in August after US District Judge Lewis Kaplan found he likely tampered with witnesses, wore a suit and spoke with two water bottles placed in front of him on the witness stand. The former mogul once known for wearing shorts and T-shirts and sporting an unkempt mop of curly locks cut his hair before his trial began.Responding to questions posed by his defense lawyer Mark Cohen, Bankman-Fried spoke in calm, measured tones during the first portion of his testimony as he recounted founding Alameda in 2017, shortly after graduating from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, despite knowing little about crypto.But Bankman-Fried - who had studied physics and worked as a quantitative trader at Jane Street - said he saw opportunities for ""arbitrage"" in the market for digital assets. He said Alameda's first office was in a small Airbnb in Berkeley, California, before he later moved the firm to Hong Kong.""We wanted to be under the radar at that point in time,"" he said on the stand, adding he named the hedge fund after the California county where it was founded in part so competitors would not discover what they were doing.Jurors have heard from three of his closest confidantes at FTX and Alameda, all of whom have pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors. They testified earlier this month that they committed financial crimes at Bankman-Fried's behest.For criminal defendants, taking the stand is a risky proposition because it opens them up to potentially probing cross-examination by prosecutors.But given Bankman-Fried's penchant for risk, legal experts say he likely viewed taking the stand as his best shot to counter the allegations made by members of his inner circle, which were backed up by spreadsheets the three said demonstrated how customer funds were stolen and text messages in which they discussed FTX's shortfall of funds with Bankman-Fried.","Sam Bankman-Fried says he made ""a number of small mistakes and a number of larger mistakes"" while running the now-bankrupt exchange.

"Indian Railways announces three big steps for train ticketing! New charting, Tatkal ticket booking, reservation system",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/infrastructure/indian-railways-announces-three-big-steps-for-train-ticketing-new-charting-tatkal-ticket-booking-reservation-system-what-they-means-for-passengers/articleshow/122143108.cms,"We take a look at the top three upcoming changes in train ticketing and what they mean for passengers:

We take a look at the top three upcoming changes in train ticketing and what they mean for passengers:

Train Chart Preparation 8 Hours in Advance

Currently, Indian Railways prepares reservation charts four hours prior to train departure. This uncertainty particularly affects those travelling from nearby locations to board their trains.

To address this concern, a new proposal suggests preparing reservation charts eight hours before departure time.

For trains scheduled before 1400 hours on a day, charts will be finalised at 2100 hrs on the preceding day.

The Railway Minister has endorsed this suggestion and instructed phased implementation to ensure smooth transition.

This revised system will provide clarity to passengers holding waitlisted tickets. They will receive updates about their waitlist status earlier than before.

The change will particularly assist travellers from distant areas or city outskirts who plan to board long-distance trains. Additionally, passengers will have sufficient time to plan alternative travel arrangements if their waitlisted tickets remain unconfirmed.

Only Verified Users for Tatkal Ticket Booking

Indian Railways has announced that starting July 1, 2025, only verified users will be permitted to book Tatkal tickets through the IRCTC website and mobile application.

through the IRCTC website and mobile application. Additionally, the implementation of OTP-based authentication for Tatkal bookings will commence from end of July.

The Railways Minister has directed the officials to expand the authentication process for Tatkal reservations.

Users will need to verify their identity using either Aadhaar or other valid government identification documents stored in their DigiLocker accounts.

Earlier, it had been announced that only Aadhaar-authenticated users will be able to book tatkal tickets from July 1, 2025. The scope of that is now being expanded to include documents in DigiLocker.

New Passenger Reservation System by December 2025

The Railways Minister conducted an assessment of passenger reservation system improvements. CRIS has been implementing this enhancement project over recent months.

The enhanced PRS infrastructure demonstrates adaptability, flexibility and expanded capacity, capable of managing ten times the existing volume. This substantial upgrade will boost ticket booking capabilities significantly.

The modernised system will facilitate over 150,000 ticket reservations per minute, representing a fivefold increase from the current capacity of 32,000 tickets per minute.

The system's enquiry processing ability will see a tenfold enhancement, expanding from 400,000 to more than 4 million enquiries per minute.

The upgraded PRS features a user-friendly interface supporting multiple languages for bookings and enquiries.

The enhanced system enables users to specify seating preferences and view fare calendars. Additionally, it incorporates dedicated facilities for Divyangjan, students, patients and other specific categories.

Indian Railways train ticket operations set for a major revamp: In a move aimed at enhancing comfort for passengers, Indian Railways is planning to gradually roll out three key changes to its passenger reservation system. The steps will involve a new procedure for booking tatkal train tickets, advance chart preparation for waitlisted passengers and the overall upgradation of the passenger reservation system.During a recent assessment of these improvements, Railway Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw stressed the importance of developing an intelligent, clear, user-friendly and productive ticketing system. The primary focus of planning should be passenger comfort, ensuring that travellers experience seamless and pleasant journeys throughout their rail travel, he has said.Indian Railways is planning to either remove or reduce the clerical charges, commonly referred to as ""clerkage"", which is currently deducted during the refund process for cancelled or unconfirmed waitlisted tickets. At present, a clerkage charge of Rs 60 is levied on both AC and non-AC reserved tickets, while Rs 30 is charged for unreserved second class tickets. This fee is applicable to all cancellations of waitlisted tickets, including those made via the IRCTC website.Officials told TOI that preliminary discussions have started regarding this matter. Should the Railways implement this change, it would benefit passengers holding waitlisted tickets who currently face two challenges: their tickets remaining unconfirmed and the subsequent deduction of clerkage charges during fare refunds.","Indian Railways is planning to gradually roll out three key changes to its passenger reservation system.

"Gold price prediction today: Where are gold rates headed on July 1, 2025 and in the near-term?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gold-price-prediction-today-where-are-gold-rates-headed-on-july-01-2025-and-in-the-near-term-mcx-gold/articleshow/122172712.cms,"Gold price prediction: Barring re-eruption of geopolitical jitters and trade frictions, gold is expected to trade with a slight bearish bias. (AI image)

Praveen Singh, Senior Fundamental Research Analyst- Currencies and Commodities at Mirae Asset Sharekhan shares his views on gold price outlook and what levels investors should watch out for:

Gold Performance:

On June 30, spot gold traded between $3,248 and $3,300 as the metal took support around $3250 for the second day in a row.

The metal fell overnight on reduced safe demand due to the Iran-Israel ceasefire and trade deal optimism. However, the metal recovered in the European session and was stable in the US session on the Fed rate cut notions as US yields eased further.

Markets look for more than 50 bps cuts ahead this year as US data, especially job data, are turning out to be disappointing amid somewhat contained inflationary pressure.

Earlier, spot gold slumped 2.79% in the week ending June 27 on reduced safe haven demand and healthy risk appetite.

Gold Price Outlook:

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market and other asset classes given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)

Gold price prediction today: Gold is expected to trade with a slightly bearish bias, analysts feel, considering the diminishing geopolitical tensions and positive talks of trade deals ahead of US President Donald Trump’s tariff deadline. What is the gold price outlook for the coming days?Markets are hopeful that the US will be able to finalize trade deals with several nations ahead of the July 9 deadline as talks with India, Japan and many other nations continue, while reportedly, the US is close to clinching deals with Mexico and Vietnam. In addition, the EU is hopeful of reaching some sort of trade agreement with the US before the deadline.President Trump said that he will not need to extend the pause on tariffs which are to take effect from July 9 as he intends to send a very fair letter to each country regarding their tariff rates.US data released Monday were weaker than expected as MNI Chicago and Dallas Fed manufacturing Activity both trailed the forecast.China's home sales slump continued in June as the value of new-home sales from the 100 largest property companies stood at 339 billion Yuan, a 23% decline from a year ago. China's manufacturing and non-manufacturing PMIs (June) came in at 49.70 (forecast 49.60) and 50.50 (forecast 50.30) respectively as composite PMI improved from 50.40 to 50.70.US Senate Republicans are committed to meet the July 4 deadline to pass legislation that contains $3.80 billion tax breaks and spending cuts. The Senate is beginning an all-day session of amendment votes on Monday in which democrats may block any provisions that may increase costs for working families or small businesses as they remain concerned about the possibility of the bill increasing the deficit. The House may vote as soon as Wednesday provided the Senate can pass the bill. Democrats maintain that Trump's tax breaks are adding to the national debt.US data on cards today include ISM manufacturing (June), S&P global US manufacturing PMI, construction spending (May), and JOLTs job openings (May).China's Caixin PMIs (June) will also be in focus.The week is data-packed with crucial US data like ISM manufacturing (June), ADP employment change (June), nonfarm payrolls (June) and ISM Services Index (June).Treasury Secretary Bessent said it would not make sense to increase sales of longer-term securities at current yields as expects the whole yield curve to shift down as inflation falls. He said that some of the Fed officials already serving at the Federal Reserve are under consideration to head the central bank.On June 30, the US Dollar Index fell to 96.85, a fresh cycle low marking the lowest level since February 2022. At the time of writing, the Index was hovering around 96.87, down nearly 0.50% on the day.The ten-year yields at 4.23% were down around 1% as the yields hover around 2-month low. 2-Year yields at 3.72% were down around 3 bps.As of June 27, total known global gold ETF holdings stood at 90.61MOz, highest since August 2023. ETF holdings are up 9.36% YTD as the ETFs recorded net inflows for the second straight month. ETFs were on track of recording a monthly inflow of more than 2 MOz after a decline of 0.68 MOz in May -- the first monthly decline this year.COMEX gold inventory stood at 37.048 MOz, which is down around 25% from the record high level of 45.072MOz seen on April 4, as buyers opt for physical delivery.In the post-war Bretton Woods era, the stock of gold held by central banks peaked at 38,000 tons in the mid-1960s. Their reserves are approaching the historic high as the reserves reached 36,000 tons in 2024.In the very short-term, tariff news flows and risk appetite will be the most important factors governing gold prices . As such the yellow metal is well supported on huge ETF inflows, a weakening US Dollar, investors opting for physical delivery, rate cut expectations and a shaky Iran-Israel ceasefire deal. However, presently, investors are focused more on trade deals and expectations of a pickup in corporate earnings as Q2 results will start pouring in soon.In all possibility, the July 9 trade deal deadline will get extended as trade negotiations are likely to extend further. Deadline extension would be a bearish development for the yellow metal.In such a scenario, barring re-eruption of geopolitical jitters and trade frictions, gold is expected to trade with a slight bearish bias.It may decline to $3228 (MCX August gold contract Rs 94,100)/$3200 (Rs 93,300) in the very short-term; however, medium to long term prospects remain quite bright. Interim support is at $3247 (Rs 94,700). Resistance is at $3310 (Rs 96,600)/$3322(Rs 96,900)/$3350 (Rs 97,700).","Spot gold fell overnight on reduced safe demand due to the Iran-Israel ceasefire and trade deal optimism.

Infosys vs Cognizant fight gets uglier! Why are the two big IT firms battling it out in the US? Explained,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/infosys-vs-cognizant-fight-gets-uglier-why-are-the-two-big-it-firms-battling-it-out-in-the-us-explained/articleshow/122189185.cms,"The legal battle revolves around TriZetto, a healthcare software platform acquired by Cognizant in 2014.

Infosys vs Cognizant: What’s the fight about?

The dispute centres on TriZetto, a healthcare software system that Cognizant purchased in 2014, which allegedly competes with Infosys's Helix platform.

According to the report, Infosys has alleged that former Helix leader and current Cognizant CEO Ravi Kumar S, who departed Infosys in October 2022, deliberately postponed Helix's introduction and subsequently recruited essential personnel after joining Cognizant in January 2023, thereby undermining the platform's potential success.

The report says that the dispute began in August 2024 when Cognizant's TriZetto launched legal proceedings against Infosys in a Texas federal court, claiming that Infosys had improperly utilised confidential information obtained through non-disclosure agreements to develop a rival solution.

Subsequently, Infosys filed countercharges in January 2025, asserting that Cognizant had deliberately recruited high-ranking staff members and utilised proprietary information to compromise Helix.

Infosys alleged that these activities were elements of a comprehensive plan to restrict competition within the American healthcare IT sector , the report adds.

What Cognizant Has Said

Infosys' Allegations of Monopoly

The Infosys vs Cognizant fight is getting uglier by the day. But why are the two IT sector giants locked in a battle or employees in the US? In an ongoing legal dispute between the two IT companies, Infosys has identified two senior Cognizant officials, Americas President Surya Gummadi and Chief People Officer Kathryn Diaz, as primary figures in what it describes as anti-competitive practices targeting its US healthcare platform, according to an ET report.The allegations were detailed in a joint court submission, highlighting concerns over competitive practices and intellectual property.Regarding leadership positions, Infosys's recent court documents claim that Gummadi and Diaz played significant roles in Cognizant's strategy to hinder Helix's market introduction. The company asserted that these senior appointments were strategically planned to diminish Infosys's market position.Also Read | 'Maintain work-life balance’: Infosys asks staff not to work overtime; Narayana Murthy had spoken of 70-hour work week idea Additionally, Infosys claimed that Ravi Kumar's previous oversight of Helix provided Cognizant with unwarranted benefits after his transition to the CEO position.Cognizant dismissed Infosys's counter allegations and sought their dismissal in court, stating that the accusations were unsupported by evidence and contained improper market definitions.""Infosys was caught red-handed misappropriating TriZetto trade secrets that Infosys originally had access to through non-disclosure and access agreements (NDAAs),"" Cognizant said in its response, according to the ET report.Additionally, Cognizant stated that Infosys had prevented an audit that would have confirmed the unauthorised access to confidential information.Also Read | It’s a first! Infosys launches cash reward policy for employees who help with hiring; staff to earn Rs 700 per interview Previously, Infosys levelled accusations against Cognizant, claiming it misused its dominant position by curtailing production and raising prices, which allegedly damaged client benefits and stifled market competition.""Monopoly power may be pled directly—through allegations of supra-competitive prices and restricted output—or inferred from the structure and composition of the relevant market,"" Infosys stated in its court filing.In its defence, Cognizant contested Infosys's monopoly claims, stating that holding 65% market share alone does not establish monopolistic control, and criticised Infosys for failing to establish clear market parameters.This dispute emerges as Indian IT companies encounter diminishing growth rates and heightened rivalry in the American market.","The legal battle revolves around TriZetto, a healthcare software platform acquired by Cognizant in 2014.

Markets watch: Asian stocks slip; oil steady ahead of OPEC+ meet,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/markets-watch-asian-stocks-slip-oil-steady-ahead-of-opec-meet/articleshow/122194780.cms,"Representative image (Picture credit: AP)

Asian equities edged lower on Wednesday while the dollar hovered near multi-year lows, as investor focus turned to the likelihood of US interest rate cuts and President Donald Trump ’s looming July 9 deadline for new trade tariffs.Meanwhile, oil prices held steady ahead of a key OPEC+ meeting this week.According to news agency Reuters, MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan slipped 0.23 per cent in early trading, retreating from recent highs. Japan’s Nikkei 225 dropped 0.78 per cent, weighed down by tech stocks, while tech-heavy markets in South Korea and Taiwan also saw declines following a sell-off in US tech firms.Trump on Tuesday ruled out extending the July 9 deadline for countries to reach trade deals with the US, casting doubts on talks with Japan but expressing hope for an agreement with India.This stance, combined with his push to pass a $3.3 trillion tax-and-spending bill, has unsettled investors already wary of rising fiscal pressures.""The near-term impact is mostly in the price, but the uncertainty factor could keep term premia elevated,"" said Aninda Mitra of BNY Investment Institute as quoted by Reuters, warning that the bill “hard wires” a steady fiscal deterioration.The dollar continued its slide, with the dollar index hovering near a low last seen in March 2022.The euro was last at $1.1793, close to a 3.5-year high, while the yen held steady around 143.52 per dollar. “Any disappointing economic data can prompt further dovish repricing of FOMC rate cuts and another round of USD selling,” said Carol Kong, strategist at Commonwealth Bank of Australia.Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell reiterated the Fed’s wait-and-see stance on rate cuts, despite political pressure from Trump. Market expectations currently price in 64 basis points of cuts for the rest of 2025, with a 21 per cent probability of a July move.According to Bloomberg, a regional stocks gauge slipped 0.2 per cent, with Japanese equities falling 1 per cent following Trump’s threat to impose higher tariffs on Tokyo and criticism of its resistance to US rice exports. While global equities sit near record levels, analysts caution that international markets may be overreacting to Trump’s trade threats. “There’s also an element of political theater here,” said Phillip Wool of Rayliant Global Advisors, as cited by Bloomberg.Meanwhile, oil markets remained in a narrow range. As per Reuters, Brent crude was up just 1 cent at $67.12 a barrel, while US WTI futures slipped 5 cents to $65.40. Traders are cautious ahead of the July 6 OPEC+ meeting, where the group is expected to agree to another production hike, possibly 411,000 barrels per day in August.Phil Flynn of Price Futures Group was quoted by Reuters as saying that “Oil prices seem to be in a tight range as we’ve seen a reduction in geopolitical risk and nerves about what OPEC may do in regards to raising production.”Geopolitical risk has eased somewhat following the end of a 12-day conflict between Iran and Israel. However, any developments from the OPEC+ meeting or from US economic data could shift prices.US crude inventories rose by 680,000 barrels last week, according to API figures, with official EIA data expected later Wednesday.With the US June payroll report due Thursday and trade tensions escalating, investors remain cautious about global growth prospects.Lower interest rates could boost economic activity and, in turn, support oil demand, said IG analyst Tony Sycamore.","MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan slipped 0.23 per cent in early trading.

Infosys Monitors Work From Home Hours

The human resources department monitors remote working hours monthly. When excessive hours are detected, they send detailed notifications to the concerned staff member, including information about remote working days, total hours worked and daily average hours.

This monitoring system was implemented following the introduction of hybrid working arrangements. The HR department now tracks the duration each employee spends on official duties whilst working remotely.

The financial daily has reviewed several such employee communications. These messages emphasised that prioritising health and work-life balance would benefit both personal well-being and professional success in the long term.

Even as Infosys founder NR Naryana Murthy calls for Indians to work 70 hours a week, the IT services giant has flagged employees working extended hours, stressing on the need for work-life balance. Infosys has started a campaign to caution staff about extended working hours during remote work periods, highlighting potential health concerns and emphasising the importance of maintaining work-life equilibrium.Infosys has sent personalised emails to staff members, requesting them to maintain standard working hours. ""We must work for 9.15 hours a day for five days a week, and if we overshoot this while working remotely, it prompts a trigger,"" an employee was quoted as saying in an ET report. The email indicates that the employee’s monthly average working hours exceeded the company's prescribed duration.Infosys employs approximately 323,500 staff members.

NEW DELHI: The Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT) on Tuesday passed an order to reinstate IPS officer Vikash Kumar Vikash by quashing his suspension. He was suspended by the state govt after the M Chinnaswamy Stadium stampede, in which 11 people died and close to 70 were injured on June 4. The CAT also ordered the govt to consider his suspension period as official duty.Vikash was the Additional Commissioner of Police (West), Bengaluru City. Senior Advocate Dhyan Chinappa appeared before the CAT representing Vikash, an advocate for Dhanush Menon. According to Vikash, he was made a scapegoat over the stampede incident and was suspended without being given a chance to explain the incident.Vikash filed a petition before CAT on June 9. In the petition, he argued that the suspension contradicted the proper procedure for suspending any govt officer. He also stressed that the police had not given permission for the Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) victory parade.In the order, CAT stated that a petition was filed on June 9 for the quashment of the order dated June 5 by the Department of Personnel & Administrative Reforms (DPAR), the respondent 2 in the case, by which the applicant was suspended along with four other officers of the Karnataka police department.The final of the IPL tournament was scheduled at Ahmedabad on June 3 between 'RCB and Punjab PBKS'. The match was between the intervening night of June 3 and June 4. After a period of 18 years, the RCB won the aforesaid final IPL match.""M/s. DNA Entertainment Network Private Limited"", the event management firm for RCB, organised a potential victory parade around the M Chinnaswamy Stadium and also a celebration at the stadium. The aforesaid celebration was scheduled for June 4, during which the stampede occurred, resulting in 11 deaths.The incident resulted in the suspension of Vikash, Inspector General of Police (IGP) holding the post of Additional CP West. By the same order, in addition to Vikash, IPS officers B Dayananda (Additional Director General and Commissioner of Police, Bengaluru City), another IPS officer Shekar H Tekkannavar (Deputy Commissioner of Police, Central Division, Bengaluru City), C Balakrishna (Assistant Commissioner of Police, Cubbon Park, Bengaluru), and Shri AK Girish (Police Inspector, Cubbon Park Police Station) were also suspended.Out of the aforesaid five officers (three IPS & two State Police Service), only Vikash filed this petition against the suspension order, CAT stated.The organiser, RCB franchise, didn’t wait for the response of the police. At the 11th hour, they submitted a letter and started the scheduled programme.On June 4, RCB posted the link on Instagram, Facebook, and X, stating that the RCB victory parade was scheduled in Bengaluru. On the same date, around 8 am, RCB posted the link on Instagram, stating, ""Army, We can’t wait to be back to the Home of Champions and celebrate with all of you today. Details out soon.""Around 3.14 pm, RCB again posted the caption on Instagram, Facebook, and X, which is more important. It says, ""RCB Victory Parade: Today at 5 pm IST. Victory Parade will be followed by celebrations at the Chinnaswamy Stadium. We request all fans to follow guidelines set by police and other authorities, so that everyone can enjoy the roadshow peacefully. Free passes (limited entry) available on shop.royalchallengers.com. ""The CAT observed that without obtaining permission from the police or the consent of the concerned police officers, the RCB franchise placed the information to the public on social media platforms. The RCB franchise unilaterally and without consultation with the city police, posted a photo at 7.01 am on the official handle of RCB on Instagram, informing that there was free entry for people and inviting the public to participate in the victory parade, which would commence at Vidhana Soudha and conclude at Chinnaswamy Stadium.The CAT stated that in the aforesaid circumstances, the action of suspending the police officers was not based on sufficient or substantial materials. At the time of passing the aforesaid order, there was no convincing material showing the default or negligence of the concerned police officers.Prima facie, it appears that, at the time of passing the impugned order of suspension, no material was available showing ""substantial dereliction of duty"". Hence, the aforesaid order is liable to be quashed.Once the order is available, Vikash is planning to submit it before the state govt and expects to be charged in the same position, his advocates said.","Vikash Kumar Vikash was the Additional Commissioner of Police (West), Bengaluru City.

Layoffs across the United States are expected to intensify this month, with nearly 95 employers planning job cuts in July, according to data from WARNTracker.com, cited by ET. The mass layoffs span a wide range of industries including tech, retail, healthcare, delivery, pharmaceuticals, and manufacturing, with thousands of jobs on the line.Companies are required to submit WARN (Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification) notices before executing such large-scale reductions. While some companies are restructuring for profitability, others cite Donald Trump’s tariff moves, inflation and weaker consumer demand as driving factors.Among the highest-profile cuts, Microsoft is projected to lay off between 1,000 and 2,500 workers this month.Here’s the full list of employers grouped by sector:Delivery, Logistics & AirlinesWhile retail sales remain largely stable, executives and analysts warn of growing consumer caution. According to the ET report, Mark Mathews, research director at the National Retail Federation (NRF), said: “We’re seeing an uptick in higher-income consumers shopping at discount and off-price retailers. This kind of trading down is a signal of distress beneath the surface.”Ben Johnston, COO of small business lender Kapitus, stated that numerous businesses are currently adopting a cautious stance, holding off on growth-related investments amid ongoing uncertainties surrounding tariffs and market demand.At Kroger, interim CEO Ronald Sargent said the 60-store closure plan is aimed at improving profitability while continuing to open new stores in high-growth regions. Walgreens is also executing a 1,200-store closure strategy, with 500 stores shutting in FY25.Together, the WARN notices, cautious borrowing, and softening demand suggest the US economy may be entering a more vulnerable labour phase, driven by a mix of regulatory pressure, political uncertainty, and shifting consumer confidence.","Layoffs across the United States are expected to intensify this month.

"US Fed policy outlook: Fed chair Jerome Powell says central bank must remain ‘non-political’ as Donald Trump pressure mounts, rate cut still not ruled out",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-fed-policy-outlook-fed-chair-jerome-powell-says-central-bank-must-remain-non-political-as-donald-trump-pressure-mounts-rate-cut-still-not-ruled-out/articleshow/122187545.cms,"US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Tuesday stressed the importance of political neutrality for the central bank, amid renewed pressure from President Donald Trump , who has criticised the Fed for not cutting interest rates more aggressively this year.Speaking at a central banking conference in Sintra, Portugal, hosted by the European Central Bank, Powell said: “We’re trying to deliver macro stability, financial stability, economic stability, for the benefit of all the people. If we’re going to do that successfully, we need to do it in a completely non-political way.”According to AFP, the comments came as Trump continues to push the Fed to lower its key rate, arguing that rate cuts would help reduce interest costs on federal debt and support economic growth. Powell, however, reaffirmed the Fed’s decision to keep rates on hold at around 4.3% while assessing the inflationary impact of the president’s sweeping tariffs.“As long as the economy is in solid shape, we think the prudent thing to do is to wait and see what those effects might be,” Powell said, quoted AP. The Fed, which cut interest rates three times in 2024, has kept policy steady in 2025 amid growing uncertainty over trade policy.Powell noted that inflation is likely to pick up later this summer, but said the timing and size of the increase due to Trump’s tariffs remain unclear. Despite maintaining a cautious stance, Powell did not rule out a rate cut at the upcoming July 29–30 policy meeting.“I wouldn't take any meeting off the table or put it directly on the table,” he said.Trump, who has repeatedly criticised Powell in public, renewed his attacks on Monday — this time expanding his criticism to include the entire Federal Reserve Board. “The board just sits there and watches, so they are equally to blame,” Trump said, escalating pressure on Fed officials like Governor Chris Waller, a Trump appointee who is viewed as a potential successor to Powell when his term ends in May 2026.In June, Powell had signalled that the Fed would “learn a great deal more over the summer” about the inflationary impact of tariffs — a message widely interpreted as a sign that any rate cut would likely be delayed until September. But in recent days, two Trump-appointed Fed governors, Waller and Michelle Bowman, said they do not expect tariffs to cause persistent inflation and suggested they may support a rate cut in July.Powell also acknowledged that without the tariffs, the Fed would probably be cutting rates already, but the uncertainty has forced policymakers to pause.Despite Trump’s criticism, markets have so far shrugged off concerns about central bank independence, especially after the US Supreme Court ruled that the president cannot fire the Fed chair, reinforcing the institution’s political insulation.","US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Tuesday stressed the importance of political neutrality for the central bank.

What is US’ 'Einstein Visa’?

What is the EB-1 Visa?



EB-1 visa: Who can apply and how?



Misinformation and dubious practices on the rise



EB-1 Visa: Application process , costs and timelines



The EB-1 visa, often dubbed the “Einstein Visa,” has surged in popularity among skilled professionals globally, especially in India, offering a faster route to US permanent residency.However, while its appeal has widened, so too has the spread of misinformation surrounding what it takes to qualify.The EB-1 is a first-preference employment-based green card category designed for individuals with proven, exceptional ability. As per ET, it is divided into three subcategories, EB-1A (extraordinary ability), EB-1B (outstanding professors and researchers), and EB-1C (multinational executives and managers).Unlike other employment-based visas, it does not require labour certification and is often processed faster, with visa numbers typically “current,” allowing immediate action once Form I-140 is approved.The EB-1A subcategory, open to self-petitioners, applies to individuals with extraordinary ability in fields like science, arts, business, education, or athletics.No employer sponsorship is needed, but applicants must show sustained national or international acclaim.Acceptable proof includes international media recognition, original contributions of major significance, authorship of scholarly articles, and more but applicants must convincingly demonstrate excellence, not just meet a checklist.In contrast, EB-1B and EB-1C require employer sponsorship. EB-1B applicants must be internationally recognised academics with at least three years of teaching or research experience and a job offer in the US.EB-1C caters to executives or managers who have worked for a related company abroad for at least one year in the last three years, entering the US to assume a similar role.But as demand spikes, concerns are growing over how the visa is being marketed. A rise in immigration agents pushing “profile-building services,” from engineered media visibility to questionable publications aimed at inflating resumes.While these practices may seem like shortcuts, US immigration officers are increasingly trained to detect and reject fraudulent profiles.False claims can lead not just to rejection, but to a permanent bar on reentry. Moreover, USCIS now rigorously checks the authenticity of awards, citations, and affiliations.Despite these risks, the EB-1 remains a powerful and prestigious pathway.Premium processing of Form I-140 costs $2,805 and guarantees a decision within 15 calendar days, though standard timelines can stretch across months.Following approval, applicants within the US may file Form I-485 to adjust status, while those abroad use Form DS-260 for consular processing, as per ET.Eligible family members, spouses and unmarried children under 21, can also apply for green cards under the same petition.While frustrations over the H-1B visa system and long green card queues have led many to eye the EB-1 as a fast-track solution, immigration experts caution that it is not a shortcut but a reward for verifiable, world-class excellence.The Einstein visa is not a myth, but it’s also not magic… Exceptional talent is earned, not engineered. And the US immigration system knows the difference.","The EB-1 is a first-preference employment-based green card category designed for individuals with proven, exceptional ability.

The electric vehicle maker's stock was weighed down by renewed hostilities between Musk and Trump, including threats over subsidies, government contracts, and regulatory scrutiny.As of 10:07 am ET on July 1, Tesla shares were trading at $303.87, down 4.34%.The latest blowup began over the weekend, with Musk posting on X that a new Republican-backed spending bill would be “political suicide for the Republican Party.”As the Senate worked through the legislation in a tense overnight session, Musk escalated his rhetoric, saying on X: “Every member of Congress who campaigned on reducing government spending and then immediately voted for the biggest debt increase in history should hang their head in shame... And they will lose their primary next year if it is the last thing I do on this Earth.”Hours later, Musk went further, announcing he may launch a new political movement.“If this insane spending bill passes, the America Party will be formed the next day... Our country needs an alternative to the Democrat–Republican uniparty so that the people actually have a VOICE,” he wrote on X.In a Truth Social post early Tuesday, Trump responded with sharp attacks on both Musk and the subsidies that have supported Tesla and SpaceX. “Elon may get more subsidy than any human being in history, by far, and without subsidies, Elon would probably have to close up shop and head back home to South Africa,” Trump wrote, as reported by AP.Trump also implied that Musk’s companies — which receive billions in federal contracts and incentives — could be targeted for cost cuts. “No more Rocket launches, Satellites, or Electric Car Production, and our Country would save a FORTUNE... Perhaps we should have DOGE take a good, hard, look at this? BIG MONEY TO BE SAVED!!!” he wrote, referencing the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which Musk had previously helped establish.Later in the day, speaking from the White House lawn before departing for Florida, Trump reiterated his frustration. “He’s very upset. You know, he can lose a lot more than that, I’ll tell you right now. Elon can lose a lot more than that,” he said when asked if he intended to take further action against Musk, according to AP.When pressed on whether Musk could be deported, Trump joked: “We’ll have to take a look... We might have to put DOGE on Elon. You know what DOGE is? DOGE is the monster that might have to go back and eat Elon. Wouldn't that be terrible? He gets a lot of subsidies.”Musk, while initially signalling a desire not to escalate the conflict, fired back with another veiled jab at Trump on X: “What good is Doge saving $160B when this bill increases the debt ceiling by $5T? It makes mockery of the work.In a note to clients on Tuesday, Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives described the unfolding feud as a major overhang on Tesla’s stock. “This BFF situation has now turned into a soap opera that remains an overhang on Tesla’s stock with investors fearing that the Trump Administration will be more hawkish and show scrutiny around Musk-related US government spending related to Tesla/SpaceX and most importantly the autonomous future with the regulatory environment key to the future of Robotaxis and Cybercabs,” Ives wrote, quoted AP.“We would expect the stock to be weak to kick off trading this morning as the Street will show concern that the Trump and Musk once BFF relationship now backfires and turns into a junior high school friendship gone bad into an enemy.”Tesla’s market share in China — its largest international market — has fallen to 7.6% in the first five months of 2025, down from 10% last year and a peak of 15% in 2020. Analysts attribute the decline to increasing competition from domestic automakers offering newer, feature-rich EVs at lower prices. The most recent threat comes from Xiaomi’s YU7 SUV, which received strong pre-orders just hours after its launch, according to Reuters.“Lagging sales in Europe compared to the rest of the EV market and the increasing competition in China are both working against Tesla going forward,” said Sam Fiorani, vice president at AutoForecast Solutions, the agency quoted.Tesla’s management has hinted at a cheaper version of the Model Y, which was expected to enter production by the end of June, though Reuters reported in April that the model’s release had been delayed by “at least a few months.”","Shares of Tesla, already down more than 20% in 2025 amid weakening demand and growing backlash against Musk, dropped nearly 6% in early trading.

U S stocks drifted lower Tuesday as Wall Street’s recent momentum slowed and shares of Tesla tumbled sharply amid an escalating rift between Elon Musk and President Donald Trump.The S&P 500 slipped 0.3% and appeared on track to break a three-day winning streak that had carried it to record highs. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped by 30 points, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite fell 0.4%, AP reported.Tesla was a major drag on the market, dropping more than 5% overnight as tensions escalated between Musk and Trump. The dispute flared anew after Musk said he’s considering forming a new political party, and Trump responded with renewed criticism of Tesla's electric vehicle subsidies and other government incentives.“Shares of Tesla tumbled more than 5% overnight after the war of words... heated up again,” AP reported, noting that Trump has slammed Musk over what he called “massive tax breaks” while Musk criticised Trump’s tariff strategy.Wall Street futures were already pointing lower before the market opened Tuesday. Futures for the Dow slipped 0.2%, S&P 500 futures dropped 0.3%, and Nasdaq futures declined 0.5%.The broader economic backdrop remained cautious.Treasury yields held relatively steady ahead of key reports on manufacturing activity and job openings. Economists are watching closely for multiple labour market updates due later in the week.Investors are also awaiting a panel discussion on European Central Bank policy that will include Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. The Fed has kept interest rates unchanged so far this year amid ongoing uncertainty over the economic impact of Trump’s tariffs.Trump’s decision to pause or delay several planned tariffs earlier this year helped power a strong rebound in US equities following a tariff-fuelled slide in the spring. However, with some of those measures still looming, the US dollar continued to weaken. It fell to 142.74 Japanese yen on Tuesday from 144.04 yen and is now down more than 9% this year.In Europe, Britain’s FTSE 100 shed 0.3%, Germany’s DAX lost 0.6%, and France’s CAC 40 fell 0.5% in midday trading.In Asia, Japan’s Nikkei 225 dropped 1.2% to 39,986.33 despite stronger-than-expected sentiment in the Bank of Japan’s latest Tankan survey of large manufacturers. Meanwhile, China’s Shanghai Composite rose 0.4% to 3,457.75 following a three-month high in both manufacturing and services PMI data.South Korea’s KOSPI added 0.6% to 3,089.65 on strong June exports, particularly for semiconductors, ships, and health products. “We expect auto exports to remain soft due to tariffs and increased production in the US,” ING Economics’ Min Joo Kang noted in a report.Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 dipped 0.1% to 8,541.10, while markets in Hong Kong were closed for the day.In energy trading, US crude oil gained 58 cents to $65.69 a barrel, and Brent crude, the international benchmark, rose 50 cents to $67.24 per barrel.","The S&P 500 slipped 0.3% and appeared on track to break a three-day winning streak.

Donald Trump tariff jitters: Asian manufacturing slumps as factory activity contracts across region; India emerges as exception,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/donald-trump-tariff-jitters-asian-manufacturing-slumps-as-factory-activity-contracts-across-region-india-emerges-as-exception/articleshow/122177618.cms,"This is an AI-generated image, used for representational purposes only.

Factory activity across many Asian economies shrank in June, dragged down by persistent uncertainty over US tariffs and weak global demand, even as a few countries like Japan and India showed signs of resilience, Reuters reported, citing private surveys.In China, the Caixin/S&P Global manufacturing PMI rose unexpectedly to 50.4 in June from 48.3 in May, signalling a marginal expansion. The improvement was driven by a rise in new orders.However, Wang Zhe, senior economist at Caixin Insight Group, was quoted by Reuters and cautioned, “The external environment remains severe and complex… The issue of insufficient effective demand at home has yet to be fundamentally resolved.”The modest uptick in China’s private sector PMI stood in contrast to official data, which showed a third straight month of contraction, underscoring ongoing domestic challenges such as weak consumption, a prolonged real-estate crisis, and high local government debt, as highlighted in an earlier AFP report.Japan’s manufacturing sector, too, edged into expansion territory for the first time in over a year, with the final au Jibun Bank PMI at 50.1 in June.However, demand conditions remained fragile. New orders shrank due to tariff uncertainty as US President Donald Trump continued to threaten fresh duties, including on Japanese rice and autos. “Trump has been shaking things up,” said Hideyuki Ishiguro of Nomura Asset Management, AFP reported, adding that tensions could undermine investor confidence in Japanese equities.South Korea’s factory activity contracted for the fifth straight month but at a slower pace, with its PMI at 48.7. The easing came amid political clarity following a snap election earlier in June.However, industry and trade minister Ahn Duk-geun warned that ""volatility in US tariff policy and economic recovery uncertainty are expected to persist in the second half,"" according to Reuters.Among Southeast Asian economies, conditions remained soft. Indonesia’s PMI dropped to 46.9, Vietnam’s to 48.9, and Taiwan’s to 47.2 in June.Malaysia’s PMI edged up slightly to 49.3 but remained in contraction territory, Reuters noted. Analysts believe policymakers in the region may now tilt more toward monetary easing. ""With worries about growth having taken precedence over those about inflation… central banks in the region will continue to loosen monetary policy,"" said Shivaan Tandon of Capital Economics.India stood out as a rare outperformer. The country’s manufacturing PMI surged to a 14-month high of 58.4 in June, driven by strong international sales and record job creation. According to Reuters, the robust activity reflects India's relative insulation from the tariff tensions roiling other export-heavy Asian economies.Meanwhile, broader market sentiment remained volatile. While Asian stocks mostly gained on hopes of US trade deals ahead of the July 9 tariff deadline, Tokyo’s Nikkei fell 1% after Trump’s renewed tariff threats. The US dollar also weakened on speculation that the Federal Reserve could cut interest rates multiple times this year.As trade negotiations between the US and several Asian partners intensify, the stakes are growing. More than a dozen countries are racing to secure deals before the White House's deadline to prevent automatic tariff hikes.Still, with fragile recoveries, sliding PMIs, and complex geopolitical crosscurrents, Asia’s manufacturing sector may continue to face headwinds through the rest of 2025.","Factory activity across many Asian economies shrank in June, dragged down by persistent uncertainty over US tariffs and weak global demand.

Japan: Manufacturing sentiment improves slightly despite tariff concerns,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/japan-manufacturing-sentiment-improves-slightly-despite-tariff-concerns-survey/articleshow/122172547.cms,"The headquarters of the Bank of Japan (BOJ) in Tokyo (Picture credit: AP)

Business sentiment among large Japanese manufacturers improved marginally in the second quarter, according to the Bank of Japan’s latest tankan survey released Tuesday, but concerns remain high over US trade policies under President Donald Trump.According to news agency AP, the index for large manufacturers rose to +13 in June, up from +12 in March, indicating more companies are optimistic than pessimistic about business conditions.The survey, seen as a key indicator ahead of the central bank’s next monetary policy meeting, pointed to a modest recovery in Japan’s manufacturing sentiment. The auto and electronics industries, which are heavily export-oriented, continue to worry about rising US tariffs.The Trump administration has already imposed 25% tariffs on imported automobiles and 50% on steel and aluminium. Many Japanese automakers, including Toyota, have operations in Mexico, also under pressure from US trade moves.Trump recently took to social media, criticising Japan for not purchasing enough American rice, saying, “They won’t take our RICE, and yet they have a massive rice shortage,” while warning that a letter to Japan was forthcoming.Despite such tensions, Japan’s unemployment rate held steady at 2.5% in May. The BOJ has maintained its benchmark interest rate at 0.5% after raising it earlier this year from 0.1%, but analysts say further hikes may be delayed, given the global uncertainty.The yen continues to weaken against the dollar, trading near 140 per US dollar, which benefits Japanese exporters but raises input costs, worsening import bills.Meanwhile, the tankan showed a slight dip in sentiment among large non-manufacturers, slipping from +35 to +34, still stronger than market expectations.According to news agency Reuters, a PMI survey showed Japan’s manufacturing sector expanded for the first time in over a year in June, with the final au Jibun Bank Japan Manufacturing PMI rising to 50.1.Although the result narrowly crossed into expansion territory, new orders dropped for the 25th straight month due to ongoing trade uncertainty. ""The latest PMI data signalled that demand conditions remained challenging,"" said Annabel Fiddes of S&P Global Market Intelligence,as cited by Reuters, adding that ""uncertainty over US tariffs"" weighed heavily on sentiment, particularly in the semiconductor and auto industries.Still, the improvement in output and employment offers some optimism. “Companies were more hopeful when looking ahead,” Fiddes noted, pointing to increases in both hiring and production in June.Overall, Japan's economic outlook remains fragile, with sentiment caught between domestic stability and external risks linked to US tariff brinkmanship.","Business sentiment among large Japanese manufacturers improved marginally in the second quarter, according to the Bank of Japan’s latest tankan survey.

Asian equities edged up on Tuesday while oil prices continued their decline amid uncertainty over US tariffs and expectations of increased crude supply by OPEC+.Investors remained cautious ahead of a crucial US Senate vote on President Donald Trump’s massive tax-and-spending bill and upcoming labour market data.As per news agency Reuters, MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.5 per cent, led by South Korea’s Kospi, which jumped 1.8 per cent.However, Japan’s Nikkei dropped up to 1.1 per cent as a stronger yen and fears over Trump’s tariff threat weighed on investor sentiment.Japanese equities also opened 0.9 per cent lower following concerns that fresh tariffs could hit the country’s exports, reported Bloomberg.Trump is pushing to pass a sweeping economic bill before the July 4 holiday, with debate continuing in the Senate. “Trade is front and centre this week, but alongside that, we've obviously got the fate of the 'One Big Beautiful Bill',” Ray Attrill of National Australia Bank was quoted as saying by Reuters.Meanwhile, the dollar fell near multi-year lows. The greenback dropped 0.3 per cent to 143.62 yen, and touched $1.1798 against the euro, its weakest since September 2021.Broader dollar weakness reflects ongoing trade tensions and expectations of potential Federal Reserve rate cuts, especially if Thursday’s US payrolls report shows slowing job growth.Oil prices slipped for the second day as traders braced for a possible output hike by OPEC+.Brent crude futures dipped 0.24 per cent to $66.58 a barrel, while US West Texas Intermediate dropped 0.31 per cent to $64.91.According to Reuters, four OPEC+ sources said the group may raise output by 411,000 barrels per day in August, adding to previous hikes and potentially boosting total supply by 1.78 million bpd this year.“The market is now concerned that the OPEC+ alliance will continue with its accelerated rate of output increases,” said ANZ’s Daniel Hynes in a client note, as cited by Reuters.US treasury secretary Scott Bessent also warned that higher tariffs could be reimposed from July 9, dampening global growth expectations. Concerns over the economic fallout from such moves further pressured oil prices.Gold prices, in contrast, rose 0.5 per cent to $3,319.55 per ounce as investors sought safety.With Wall Street coming off its best quarter since December 2023 and geopolitical risks easing after the Israel-Iran ceasefire, markets now await Thursday’s US jobs data, which could shape expectations for Fed action in the coming months.","MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.5%.

Inspired by Warren Buffett’s investment mantras? These 3 stocks make up 66% of Bill Gates' Foundation's $45 billion portfolio — check list,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/inspired-by-warren-buffetts-investment-mantras-these-3-stocks-make-up-66-of-bill-gates-foundations-45-billion-portfolio-check-list/articleshow/122165059.cms,"Bill Gates stands amongst the world's richest individuals. (AI image)

Berkshire Hathaway (18.4%)

Microsoft (31.1.%)

Waste Management (16.2%)

With wealth surpassing $100 billion, Bill Gates stands amongst the world's richest individuals. His philanthropic contributions to the Gates Foundation, established in 2000, have exceeded $60 billion, demonstrating remarkable generosity. The investment portfolio of the Gates Foundation combines technological expertise and wisdom from a legendary investor's influence.Bill Gates’ personal investment holdings, which include substantial Microsoft shares (MSFT 0.60%) and various strategic investments, have largely funded these charitable contributions.Beyond Microsoft, Gates adopts a value-oriented investment approach, that appears to be influenced by his close associate and former Gates Foundation trustee and contributor, Warren Buffett , according to a report by The Motley Fool.The Foundation's investment strategy reflects both Gates and Buffett's financial philosophies, featuring a concentrated selection of the topmost investments. As a result, three exceptional stocks constitute approximately two-thirds of the foundation's trust fund holdings. We take a look at them.Warren Buffett remains a significant contributor to the Gates Foundation, with his contributions since 2006 exceeding $43 billion.His donations specifically comprise Class B shares of Berkshire Hathaway. He retains company control through a strategic approach of converting high-voting Class A shares to Class B shares prior to donation.The Foundation operates under specific conditions set by Buffett, requiring annual grant payments equivalent to his donation amount plus 5% of trust assets. Despite these requirements, the Foundation has retained substantial Berkshire Hathaway holdings, possessing 17.1 million shares valued at approximately $8.3 billion at the first quarter's end, the The Motley Fool report says.A significant portion of Berkshire's worth is derived from its portfolio of publicly traded equities and cash holdings. Its total liquid investments amount to approximately $631.8 billion. Buffett maintains more than half of this amount in Treasury bills or cash whilst searching for valuable investment opportunities. However, due to Berkshire's substantial size, only a limited number of companies remain as feasible investment targets.When Microsoft was established in 2000, Bill Gates initiated donations of company shares, consistently increasing his contributions over time. Despite utilising shares to support grants, the foundation has accumulated a significant position in the organisation. By the end of quarter one, the trust maintained approximately 28.5 million shares, valued at over £14 billion as of late June.The company's shares have reached unprecedented levels recently, driven by its achievements in artificial intelligence (AI).Following a £10 billion investment in OpenAI in early 2023, Microsoft's Azure emerged as the premier cloud computing service for developers seeking access to advanced AI models. The company has demonstrated exceptional performance, achieving 33% growth in its latest quarter. Additionally, Microsoft executives indicate that demand continues to exceed supply capacity, suggesting sustained growth prospects for the foreseeable future, the report said.Microsoft's enterprise software division has experienced significant growth through AI integration. The company's Microsoft 365 commercial segment has achieved substantial revenue increases, driven by expanded user base and enhanced pricing structures.The organisation has introduced specialised AI-driven assistants, known as Copilots, across various platforms including GitHub and Dynamics 365, enhancing business software functionality. Additionally, their Copilot Studio enables organisations to develop customised AI assistants using their proprietary data.These initiatives have resulted in robust revenue expansion and increased profitability through improved margins. With Azure's continued prominence in Microsoft's strategy, this positive trajectory is expected to continue.The Gates Foundation trust's investment portfolio largely mirrors the value-investing principles that brought success to Warren Buffett. Waste Management stands out as a prime example of this approach.Since 2002, Waste Management has remained a consistent component of the portfolio. This long-term investment has shown steady value appreciation over time, with minimal share disposals. At the conclusion of the first quarter, the trust maintained ownership of 32.2 million shares, currently valued at approximately £7.3 billion.The company's appeal lies in its substantial competitive advantage. Its unrivalled network of landfills creates a barrier that competitors cannot overcome, given the stringent permitting requirements for new facilities. This position enables Waste Management to generate revenue from smaller waste collection firms requiring access to its disposal sites. Additionally, its operational efficiency benefits from economies of scale, enabling optimised collection routes and enhanced operational performance. These factors contribute to the company's robust profit margins.The company's surplus funds have enabled its expansion through acquisitions, notably Stericycle, now operating as WM Healthcare Solutions. During the latest investor presentation, the leadership team projected £50 million in additional revenue through cross-selling with Stericycle, complementing the £250 million in operational efficiencies.The leadership anticipates yearly revenue expansion of approximately 9%, alongside improved EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation) margins through 2027. This financial performance will generate substantial free cash flow, enabling further strategic acquisitions, dividend increases, and share buybacks.The current enterprise value stands at roughly 15 times the projected EBITDA for the upcoming 12 months, suggesting reasonable valuation. This presents a viable investment option for those seeking dividend growth companies with robust free cash flow potential, the Motley Fool report added.","The investment portfolio of the Gates Foundation combines technological expertise and wisdom from a legendary investor's influence.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Explainer: What is 'Hindu rate of growth' and why Raghuram Rajan's remarks may be 'premature',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/explainer-what-is-hindu-rate-of-growth-and-why-raghuram-rajans-remarks-may-be-premature/articleshow/98482598.cms,"What is meant by Hindu growth rate

How India's GDP has been growing

What SBI report said on savings and investment

Incremental capital output ratio

NEW DELHI: India's gross domestic product (GDP) data for the third quarter (October-December 2022) received a word of caution from the former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan In an interview with news agency PTI, Rajan that India is ""dangerously close"" to the Hindu rate of growth in view of subdued private sector investment, high interest rates and slowing global growth.India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying"".However, a report released by the State Bank of India (SBI) economists on Tuesday dismissed arguments that India is dangerously close to Hindu rate of growth saying such statements are ""ill-conceived, biased and premature"".The term 'Hindu growth rate' was coined by late economist Raj Krishna in 1978 to describe the slow growth in the country.It basically refers to the low pace of economic growth rates during 1950s to 1980s. During this period, the Indian economy averaged 3.5%.A former lecturer at the Delhi School of Economics (DSE), Krishna noted that only if the rate of growth is persistently slow and accompanied by low per-capita GDP, then it will be known as Hindu rate of growth but it has to factor in population growth as well.Before economic reforms of 1991, India's economic growth remained stagnant and low, while per capita income averaged around 1.3%. Krishna termed this low growth situation to be a result of socialist policies of state control and import substitution.However, the economic situation changed when liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation (LPG) reforms came into effect in the year 1991, at a time when India faced balance of payment crisis.Over the years, many economists have strongly opposed the idea of 'Hindu growth rate' and the term never had universal acceptance.The Indian economy plunged into its very first technical recession in FY21 due to the impact of Covid-19 pandemic and the related nationwide lockdowns. GDP shrunk by an unprecedented 23.8% in the first quarter of the financial year 2020-21. However, due to spurt in economic activities in the subsequent quarters, the GDP decline started to narrow.However, if we look at the period before Covid-19 as well, India's growth curve shows a declining trend.From 8.26% in FY17, GDP growth plunged to 3.74% in FY20. Shutdown of economic activities in FY21 in wake of Covid-19 only made matters worse.As lockdowns started to ease and business activities resumed, India's GDP also started rising. In Q1 of FY22, growth jumped to 20.1% mainly on account of low base effect. By the fourth quarter of FY22, growth came down to 4.10%.Similarly, the new financial year 2022-23 brought fresh economic challenges in the form of Russia-Ukraine war that impacted almost all major economies of the world, slowed the pace of growth, pushed inflation to record highs.As a result, the central banks of all advanced economies spurred into action and opted for monetary policy tightening to curb the soaring inflation.With persistently rising interest rates, India's economy grew by 4.4% in Q3 of FY23, as the Centre revised upwards GDP growth for previous year to 9.10% from 8.7% earlier.The report weighed recent GDP numbers against the available data on savings and investments for the past decade and highlighted some interesting points.""Quarterly growth numbers are noisy and should be best avoided for any serious interpretation (on an average, India's GDP growth has witnessed Rs 2 lakh crore upward revision for the 3 year ended FY23),"" the report said.Gross capital formation (GCF) by the government touched a high of 11.8% in 2021-22, up from 10.7% in 2020-21.""This also had a domino effect on private sector investment that jumped from 10 per cent to 10.8% over the same period,"" it said.In fact, Ecowrap added that the trends in GCF to gross output ratio or the plough back of funds for creation of fresh capacity shows that for public administration the ratio attained fresh peak in 2021-22 owing to the emphasis on capital expenditure in recent budgets.At the aggregate level, gross capital formation is supposed to have crossed 32% in 2022-23, the highest level since 2018-19.According to the report, in 2021-22, gross savings have risen to 30% from 29% in 2020-21.""The ratio is supposed to have crossed 31 per cent in 2022-23, the highest since 2018-19. The household savings increased sharply during the pandemic period on account of sharp accretion in financial savings such as deposits,"" said the report by SBI's Economic Research Department.While household financial savings have since then moderated from 15.4% in 2020-21 to 11.1% in 2022-23, savings in physical assets have grown sharply to 11.8% in 2021-22 from 10.7% in 2020-21.The report further analysed Incremental Capital Output ratio (ICOR) -- which measures additional units of capital (investment) needed to produce additional units of output. It said that the ratio has been improving.""ICOR which was 7.5 in FY 12 is now only 3.5 in FY22. Clearly, only half of capital is now needed for next unit of output,"" the report noted.Such reducing ICOR in the current years reflects a relatively increasing efficiency of capital and shows that the economy is on a sound footing, the report said.""From that point of view, future GDP growth rates even at 7% could still mean a decent number by any standards!,"" it added.","India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%. Raghuram Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying""","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-98483158,imgsize-65724,width-400,resizemode-4/98483158.jpg"

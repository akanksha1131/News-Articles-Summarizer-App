Trump’s promise of tariff payments









US President Donald Trump on Friday gave a sigh of relief to American consumers with the announcement of cutting tariffs on a range of products such as beef, coffee, tropical fruits and other commodities. This comes as a major shift in his trade policy as the White House moves to address rising costs for US shoppers.Trump has built his second term on levying tariffs on imported goods, aiming to boost domestic production and strengthen the US economy. His decision to lift tariffs on foods central to American diets follows recent off-year elections, in which economic concerns played a decisive role, contributing to Democratic wins in Virginia, New Jersey, and other key races.“We just did a little bit of a rollback on some foods like coffee,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One while travelling to Florida hours after the announcement.When asked whether his tariffs had contributed to higher prices for Americans, the president said, “I say they may, in some cases. But to a large extent they’ve been borne by other countries,” AP cited the US president.Inflation remains high despite Trump’s repeated claims that it has disappeared since he took office in January, keeping pressure on household budgets.While the administration has argued that tariffs have primarily helped government revenues, Democrats have portrayed Friday’s move as a tacit admission that these policies have hurt American consumers.“President Trump is finally admitting what we always knew: his tariffs are raising prices for the American people,” said Virginia Democratic Rep. Don Beyer.“After getting drubbed in recent elections because of voters’ fury that Trump has broken his promises to fix inflation, the White House is trying to cast this tariff retreat as a ‘pivot to affordability.’”Trump’s tariffs, imposed globally in April, have faced criticism for contributing to high prices for staples such as beef, particularly from Brazil. However, with the new tariff cuts, many producets will become more affordable for Americans.The new executive order also removes tariffs on:Many of these products are not produced domestically, meaning the tariffs had little effect on encouraging US production, but the removal is expected to ease prices for consumers.The Food Industry Association welcomed the decision, calling it “swift tariff relief” and emphasising that import taxes are “an important factor” amid broader supply chain issues. “President Trump’s proclamation to reduce tariffs on a substantial volume of food imports is a critical step ensuring continued adequate supply at prices consumers can afford,” the association said.The White House noted that some tariffs were no longer necessary due to trade agreements negotiated with key partners. Framework agreements with Ecuador, Guatemala, El Salvador, and Argentina aim to boost US exports while potentially easing tariffs on agricultural products from those countries.Earlier in the week, Trump had hinted at tariff cuts in an interview with Fox News’ Laura Ingraham, saying, “Coffee, we’re going to lower some tariffs. We’re going to have some coffee come in.”Trump indicated that revenue from tariffs could fund $2,000 payments for many Americans, possibly in 2026, though he did not specify a timeline.He also suggested the money could be used to reduce national debt. Defending the move against inflation concerns, Trump said, “This is money earned as opposed to money that was made up. Everybody but the rich will get this. That’s not made up. That’s real money. That comes from other countries.”","US President Donald Trump on Friday gave a sigh of relief to American consumers with the announcement of cutting tariffs on a range of products such as beef, coffee, tropical fruits and other commodities.

Benchmark indices ended their two-week losing streak and are trading firmly higher this week, in line with gains across global markets. Investor confidence has strengthened as the US government shutdown came to an end, with growing expectations of early Federal Reserve rate cuts amid signs of a slowdown in the U.S. job market. Additionally, India’s CPI data came in at a record low, while exit polls from the Bihar election indicating a majority for the ruling NDA further lifted sentiment. Hopes of an India–US trade deal also added to the positive momentum.Market trajectory in the upcoming week is likely to be driven by the outcome of the Bihar election, scheduled for release tomorrow, and key developments surrounding the anticipated India–U.S. trade agreement. Both factors are expected to act as major sentiment catalysts and could trigger heightened volatility across broader indices.Going forward, the broader market structure remains constructive, and we maintain a bullish bias.We recommend utilizing any corrective declines as accumulation opportunities for the next leg of the uptrend, with upside targets placed at 26,100, followed by a potential retest of the all-time high near the 26,277 zone in the coming weeks.In line with expectations, buying demand during last week emerged from the support area of 25,500-25,300. We expect the index to hold above the same being the confluence of the following technical observations.Among the oscillators, the daily 14 periods RSI has recently generated a buy signal thus supports the overall positive bias in the index.Bank Nifty continues to consolidate in the range of 57200-58600 for the fourth week in a row and is currently placed around the upper band of the range.Going ahead we expect the index to break above the upper band of the consolidation range and head towards 59,000 and 59,800 levels in the coming weeks being the measuring implication of the last 4 weeks range.On the downside, the lower band of the consolidation range at 57,300–57,100, which coincides with the recent breakout zone and the 20-day EMA, is likely to act as a strong support area.Among the oscillators, the daily 14 periods RSI has recently generated a buy signal thus supports the overall positive bias in the index.CG Power is highly optimistic, driven by structural industry tailwinds (T&D capex, railway modernization, Make in India), aggressive capacity expansion, and a strategic push into semiconductors and services. Company benefits from a diverse customer base, a strong manufacturing foundation, continuous R&D and product development, and rising export opportunities.The company faces challenges from the cyclical nature of the power business, increasing transformer supply in India, and its lack of prior experience in semiconductors. We have valued the company using the P/E valuation method, applying a 57x multiple on FY28E earnings, arriving at a target price of Rs 798.The stock is forming base around the 80% retracement of the previous major up move of October 2025 and has witnessed a shallow retracement of its previous up move signaling overall positive bias in the stock.We expect the stock to resume up move and head towards 7980 levels in the coming month being the confluence of the previous major high and key retracement of the current decline.Among the oscillators the daily stochastic has approached oversold territory and is seen rebounding from the same thus signals pullback in the coming months.","According to Bajaj Broking Research, the top stock picks for November 14, 2025 are CG Power and Industrial Solutions, and Apollo Hospitals Enterprise.

Gold Price Outlook

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market, other asset classes or personal finance management tips given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)





Gold price ended last week almost flat showing consolidated moves while positive developments over US Shutdown reopening over the weekend revived prospects for rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve (Fed) in December shifting focus back to deteriorating US Fiscal outlook. US private jobs data released last week indicated a weak labour market, further supporting the US rate cut prospects. US Challenger job data also indicated a spike in job cuts, suggesting a possible cooling in US labour market conditions.CME Fed funds tool showed rate cut possibility for December 10 -11 meeting have risen to above 90 % now from around 66 % yesterday. Worries about the potential economic fallout from the longest-ever US government shutdown turned out to be a key factor that continued to underpin demand for the safe-haven commodity as the yellow metal rose to three week highs in the current week.Inflation concerns also persisted as President Donald Trump floated the idea of sending American rebate checks of at least $ 2000 a person (excluding high income people) for the tariffs that his administration has collected which provided additional support to yellow metal.In other news, China central bank continued to buy gold for 12th Consecutive month as data showed China's official gold reserves stood at 74.09 MOz at the end of October up 74.06 Moz from a month earlier, which meant PBoC bought nearly one tonne which continued to boost sentiments in Gold.Meanwhile spot silver rose more than 4 % to above $50 per oz, reaching its highest since October 21. The US, which added copper, and silver to its critical minerals list, also provided structural support for precious and industrial metals. However, the supply shortage which persisted in October has likely eased now indicating an unlikely scenario for new highs in spot, but prices could still find support from uncertain economic conditions in the US which could keep safe haven flows intact in white metal.In the near term, gold is expected to test its resistance zone around $ 4190 – 4210 per oz (CMP $ 4135/Oz) while buying on dips could remain a favourable strategy for the metal. Support for the yellow metal could persist in the range of $ 4110 – 4075 per oz in near term. On MCX futures (CMP 124,850/10 gm) prices are expected to witness strong supports in the range of 1,23,800 – 1,22,900 per 10 gm levels in near term as resistance on higher side to remain at around Rs, 1,26,500 – 1,27,900 /10 gm levels for the week.Looking ahead for the week, volatility in prices could also occur at higher levels driven by fluctuations in the dollar index and global financial market as traders could closely monitor the US October Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation data later on Thursday. The headline CPI is expected to show an increase of 0.2% MoM in October, while the core CPI is projected to show a rise of 0.3% MoM during the same period. The US Retail Sales will be in the spotlight on Friday.Silver could also trade with a positive bias as a rise towards $ 52. 20 - 52.50 per oz (CMP $ 51.10/Oz) in spot cannot be ruled out in near term. Strong support could persist in the range of $ 50.20 – 49.50 /Oz levels. On MCX futures contract (CMP Rs. 1,55,500/Kg.) This could translate to a support level of Rs. 1,52,500–1,50,800 / Kg & resistance at Rs 1,58,000 - 1,59,500/Kg levels for the week.","Gold prices are expected to face upside resistance, and buying on dips may be a favourable strategy, says Maneesh Sharma, AVP - Commodities & Currencies, Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers.

US government shutdown: Supreme Court extends block on Snap payments; hopes rise for potential end to standoff,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-govt-shutdown-supreme-court-extends-block-on-snap-payments-hopes-rise-for-potential-end-to-standoff/articleshow/125263032.cms,"1000+ Flights Cancelled As Shutdown Severely Impacts American Aviation Sector

Snap benefits









The US Supreme Court had, once again, refused to order the Trump administration to provide full funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap). Instead it has chosen to allow congress additional time to resolve the matter through a possible agreement tied to ending the government shutdown.In an order issued on Tuesday (local time), the justices extended a temporary halt on a lower court ruling that had required the administration to release full food benefit payments. The stay remains active until November 13, effectively putting the funding issue on hold without the court examining the legal arguments of either side.The dispute reached the Supreme Court after Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, who handles emergency requests from the 1st US Circuit Court of Appeals’ jurisdiction, paused a district court-imposed deadline for the payments while the appeals judges reviewed the case.Jackson, one of the court’s liberal justices, approved an emergency request from the administration, even though the matter involves a programme strongly supported by Democrats. In the latest order, Jackson stated she disagreed with the court’s decision to keep the pause in place on full Snap funding.Meanwhile, lawmakers are racing to reach a broader deal. The House of Representatives is expected to vote on Wednesday on a plan to reopen the government through January 30.That proposal includes full-year funding for several federal agencies and services, covering food assistance and benefits for veterans.The department of justice has warned the Supreme Court that judicial intervention risks complicating shutdown negotiations.Government lawyers, according to USA Today, have argued that the lower courts introduced a “massively inappropriate new variable” and disrupted the operation of Snap. Solicitor General John Sauer wrote, ""Congress appears to be on the brink of breaking the deadlock, though that outcome is unsure.”“The district court’s unlawful orders risk upsetting that compromise and throwing into doubt how innumerable critical federal programs will be funded,"" Sauer was further quoted by the agency.The legal fight began when the US district judge John McConnell in Rhode Island ordered the administration to use contingency Snap funds and other available money to ensure full November payments reached states by November 7. The appeals court sided with McConnell, ruling that the danger of leaving tens of millions of Americans without adequate food support outweighed the administration’s objections to using alternative funds.The groups opposing the Trump administration have argued that Snap recipients had “now gone ten days without the help they need to afford food,” warning that millions of Americans, including children, were already going hungry.Almost 42 million people across the country rely on food stamps, which are distributed in phases throughout the month. According to Code for America, an organisation that helps governments improve access to public benefit programmes, about 27 million of them should have received their payments by Monday.US households, according to CNN, on an average get roughly $350 a month to purchase food, but for many families, that money runs out quickly.","The US Supreme Court extended a temporary halt on a lower court ruling that had required the administration to release full food benefit payments.

New Delhi: Passengers may soon find popular food chains such as KFC, McDonald’s, Baskin Robbins, Pizza Hut, Haldiram’s and Bikanerwala at railway stations. The railway board has revised its catering policy to allow premium brand catering outlets to operate at stations across the country.The proposal to issue guidelines for premium single-brand catering outlets was mooted by the South Central Railway zone. Sources said the proposal comes at a time when the railways is redeveloping over 1,200 stations across the country, including major ones in mega cities like Delhi, Mumbai and Ahmedabad. The revamped stations can easily offer space for such outlets.According to the revised norms circulated to all zones on Thursday, zonal railways will allow single-brand and company-owned, operated or franchisee outlets wherever there is demand and justification, by incorporating them into the station plan or blueprint without disturbing the existing reservation policy for allotting stalls. The current reservation policy specifies quotas for SCs, STs, OBCs, freedom fighters and their widows, and persons displaced due to land acquired by the railways.The board has clarified that stalls for premium brands cannot be allotted on a nomination basis. Such outlets will be allotted only through the existing e-auction policy, and the tenure for operating each outlet will be five years.At present, stations have three types of stalls selling food products—beverages, snacks, tea, milk bars and juice bars.Now, a new category, “Premium Brand Catering Outlet,” has been added as the fourth type.Around 2.3 crore passengers travel by train in India every day.Sources admitted that there is a demand for such outlets at several stations where the footfall is high. “The zones concerned will carry out an assessment of demand, available space and how to implement it. They will formulate special conditions of contract as per requirement,” said an official.","Passengers may soon find popular food chains such as KFC, McDonald’s, Baskin Robbins, Pizza Hut at railway stations.

USPS financial loss: Postal Service flags $9 bn deficit; agency pushes price hikes and policy fixes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/usps-financial-loss-postal-service-flags-9-bn-deficit-agency-pushes-price-hikes-and-policy-fixes/articleshow/125351668.cms,"



The US Postal Service (USPS) has sought sweeping administrative and legislative changes after reporting a $9 billion annual loss, a marginal improvement from the $9.5 billion deficit posted last year, Reuters reported.New Postmaster General David Steiner said the agency continues to face a “significant systemic annual revenue and cost imbalance” and must accelerate efficiency measures, Reuters reported. “To correct our financial imbalances, we must explore new revenue opportunities and public policy changes to improve our business model,” he said.USPS has lost over $100 billion since 2007, even after rounds of restructuring and a $50 billion financial package approved by Congress in 2022. The agency is now seeking reforms that include changes to retiree pension funding rules, diversification of pension assets, a higher statutory borrowing limit and updates to workers’ compensation processes.Alongside reform demands, USPS has proposed new price increases across several products — excluding first-class mail. The plan includes a 6.6% hike for Priority Mail, 5.1% for Priority Mail Express, 7.8% for USPS Ground Advantage, and 6% for Parcel Select.The cost of a first-class stamp rose to 78 cents this year from 73 cents, marking a 46% increase since 2019.In February, President Donald Trump called USPS a “tremendous loser for this country” and said he was considering merging it with the Commerce Department — a move Democrats said would violate federal law.Former Postmaster General Louis DeJoy resigned in March under White House pressure after nearly five years of sweeping operational changes that halved projected 10-year losses from $160 billion to $80 billion.Mail volumes dropped 5% in the year ended September 30 to the lowest level since 1967, underscoring the structural decline in traditional postal services.USPS, which employs 635,000 people, cut 10,000 positions this year through a voluntary retirement programme as part of its cost-reduction efforts.","USPS has lost over $100 billion since 2007, even after rounds of restructuring and a $50 billion financial package approved by Congress in 2022.

Ethics scandal: Ex-Fed governor Adriana Kugler broke trading rules; disclosures show repeated policy violations,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/ethics-scandal-ex-fed-governor-adriana-kugler-broke-trading-rules-disclosures-show-repeated-policy-violations/articleshow/125358814.cms,"File photo: Ex-Fed governor Adriana Kugler (Picture credit: AP)





Former Federal Reserve governor Adriana Kugler, who resigned abruptly in August, repeatedly broke the central bank’s strict trading rules before stepping down, according to new disclosures released by US ethics authorities.A report by the US Office of Government Ethics, reviewed after the Federal Reserve referred the matter earlier this year, outlines multiple stock transactions in 2024 that violated Fed policy, as per news agency AP.Kugler listed more than a dozen trades in individual company shares, including Apple, Southwest Airlines, Caterpillar and Fortinet, many of which took place during official blackout periods when financial transactions are prohibited.One of the largest was an Apple stock purchase worth $100,000–$250,000 in April 2024, reported AP.Fed rules, strengthened in 2022 to avoid conflicts of interest, bar senior officials from holding or trading individual stocks, bonds or cryptocurrencies.They require 45 days’ notice and prior approval for any permitted transactions, and forbid trades roughly 10 days before and one day after Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings.Kugler’s disclosures also show sales and purchases involving Palo Alto Networks, Cava Group, and Southwest Airlines that occurred within days of Fed policy meetings.She stated repeatedly that the trades were carried out by her husband without her knowledge, and that he did not intend to break any rules.According to officials cited by CNBC, Kugler had earlier sought a waiver from Chair Jerome Powell after acknowledging impermissible holdings, but this request was denied.

Energy standoff: US tells Serbia to remove Russian ownership from NIS entirely; Belgrade warns of ‘historic’ decisions ahead,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/energy-standoff-us-tells-serbia-to-remove-russian-ownership-from-nis-entirely-belgrade-warns-of-historic-decisions-ahead/articleshow/125352845.cms,"



The United States has told Serbia it will not lift sanctions on the country’s largest oil company, NIS, unless Belgrade ensures a complete withdrawal of Russian ownership, Serbian Energy Minister Dubravka Djedovic Handanovic said on Saturday, calling the weeks ahead “some of the most difficult decisions in our history”.NIS — the Petroleum Industry of Serbia — has been under US sanctions since 2022, imposed as part of Washington’s crackdown on Russia’s energy sector following the invasion of Ukraine, AFP reported. The measures have dealt a severe blow to Serbia, leaving the country perilously close to a winter energy crisis, with its only refinery at risk of shutting down.Handanovic said Belgrade had asked the Trump administration to lift sanctions in exchange for a management restructuring, but US officials insisted on full Russian divestment. “For the first time, the US administration has clearly and unequivocally said it wants a complete change of Russian shareholders,” she told reporters.Washington has given Serbia until February 13 to negotiate a solution.NIS is 45% owned by Gazprom Neft, already sanctioned by Washington. Gazprom transferred its additional 11.3% stake to another Russian entity, Intelligence, in September. The Serbian state holds nearly 30%, with the remainder dispersed among minority shareholders.Despite several postponements, the US Treasury began enforcing sanctions on NIS on October 9, intensifying pressure on Belgrade.The Serbian government is now examining whether it may need to take control of NIS to keep the energy system from collapsing. A special cabinet meeting is scheduled for Sunday.Handanovic acknowledged internal resistance, saying “I know President (Aleksandar) Vucic is against nationalisation, as are many of us in the government,” she said. “We will not let our country be put in danger, but we may face some of the most difficult decisions in our history in the coming days.”She urged Moscow to recognise the seriousness of the moment. “I hope our Russian friends will understand the gravity of the situation and help us overcome it,” she said.Serbia, which relies heavily on Russian natural gas, remains one of the few European nations that has not imposed sanctions on Moscow since the Ukraine war began.","Serbia's largest oil company, NIS, has been under US sanctions since 2022.

India could secure a marginal competitive advantage in a select group of agricultural products after the United States removed several items from its reciprocal tariff list, the Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI) has said in a new analysis.A White House Executive Order issued on November 12 exempted coffee, tea, tropical fruits, fruit juices, cocoa, spices, bananas, tomatoes, beef and some fertilizers from the 25–50 per cent reciprocal tariffs imposed on April 2. These goods will now face only standard MFN duties, with the exemption taking effect on November 13.According to GTRI, India’s immediate export gains will be limited because its presence in the newly liberalised tariff lines is small. Of the United States’ $50.6-billion import basket for these products, India supplies just $548 million, dominated by a handful of high-value spices and tea.“India exports pepper and capsicum preparations worth $181 million, ginger-turmeric-curry spices at $84 million, and anise-cumin seed categories at $85 million. Tea exports stand at $68 million,” said GTRI co-founder Ajay Srivastava.However, India has “almost no presence” in some of the largest tariff-exempt categories such as tomatoes, citrus fruits, melons, bananas, fresh fruits and fruit juices, the analysis noted.US global imports in these categories are sizeable:India’s share in many of these is negligible — including zero exports in tomatoes, citrus fruits and melons, and less than $0.5 million in bananas.GTRI said the exemption reflects Washington’s need to keep duties low on items “not produced domestically in adequate quantities or dependent on climate conditions the US cannot replicate.”The think tank said that it remains unclear whether Indian shipments will be exempt from the 25 per cent reciprocal tariff alone or from the full 50 per cent rate as well. The interpretation of the new order “will determine whether India gains meaningful price competitiveness” in select products, GTRI said.While the policy shift marginally strengthens India’s position in spices and niche horticulture, GTRI cautioned that most of the gains will accrue to Latin American, African and ASEAN exporters that already dominate US imports of fruits, juices and other exempted lines.“The broader gains will go to countries with scale, strong cold-chain infrastructure and diversified agricultural export baskets,” Srivastava said.","A White House Executive Order issued on November 12 exempted coffee, tea, tropical fruits, fruit juices, cocoa, spices, bananas, tomatoes, beef and some fertilizers.

India’s gems and jewellery exports fell sharply in October, sliding 30.57% to $2.17 billion (Rs 19,172.89 crore) compared to the same month last year, according to data released by the Gems and Jewellery Export Promotion Council (GJEPC), PTI reported.Exports in October 2024 had stood at $3.12 billion (Rs 26,237.1 crore).GJEPC chairman Kirit Bhansali said the decline was largely expected, as overseas buyers had advanced their festive-season stocking before the US tariff came into effect.“Most of the stocking up for the festivals took place before August 27. Therefore, in October the demand was down. The decline in gold and silver exports is triggered by volatile bullion prices,” Bhansali told PTI.He added that exports should revive in November with Chinese market recovery and Christmas demand from major global buyers.Exports of cut and polished diamonds fell 26.97% to $1.02 billion (Rs 9,071.41 crore), down from $1.40 billion (Rs 11,806.45 crore) a year earlier.Shipments of polished lab-grown diamonds also saw a steep slide of 34.90% to $94.37 million (Rs 834.45 crore), compared with $144.96 million (Rs 1,218.25 crore) last October.Gold jewellery exports dropped 28.4% to $850.15 million (Rs 7,520.34 crore) from $1.18 billion (Rs 9,975.17 crore) a year earlier.Exports of coloured gemstones during April–October slipped 3.21% to $250.14 million (Rs 2,173.08 crore).Silver jewellery shipments dipped 16% in October to $121.37 million (Rs 1,072.81 crore), down from $145.05 million (Rs 1,219.01 crore) in 2024.","India’s gems and jewellery exports fell sharply in October, sliding 30.57% to $2.17 billion (Rs 19,172.89 crore) compared to the same month last year.

India will require as many as 30,000 additional pilots to operate the 1,700 aircraft currently on order with Boeing and Airbus, Union Civil Aviation Minister K Ram Mohan Naidu said on Saturday, underscoring the scale of workforce expansion needed for the country’s rapidly growing aviation market.Speaking at a session on the sidelines of the CII Partnership Summit, Naidu said the current ecosystem of Flying Training Organisations (FTOs) is inadequate to meet future demand, with only limited pilot output annually, PTI quoted.India presently has about 8,000 pilots for a fleet of 834 aircraft, but 2,000–3,000 of them are not actively flying, he noted. With airlines expanding aggressively, staffing requirements will multiply.“To run one aircraft in a proper schedule, you need at least 10 to 15 pilots. So for 1,700 planes, the requirement would be around 25,000 to 30,000 pilots. That is the demand that is going to be generated,” Naidu said.The minister stressed the need to scale up skilling infrastructure. “It is very, very important for us to train our individuals and to have the skilling and training ecosystem perfectly done in the country,” he said.Each aviation job, he added, creates 15 indirect jobs, far higher than the IATA estimate of six.Naidu also said the Centre is studying a FedEx-style model of dedicated cargo airports, acknowledging that air cargo has been losing out to cheaper road and rail options, while airport operators prioritise passenger facilities.He highlighted India’s growing capability in aerospace manufacturing, with domestic firms currently producing USD 2 billion worth of components and targeting USD 4 billion by 2030.India’s long-term ambition of designing and manufacturing a full aircraft domestically is also gaining momentum, Naidu said. “We see that India has come to the stage where we can manufacture, we can design, we can maintain our own aircraft today. That is one area we are actively working on.”The minister noted that 4.8 lakh passengers fly across India on an average day, and 5.3 lakh travellers flew on November 10, marking a new milestone for domestic aviation.","India will require as many as 30,000 additional pilots to operate the 1,700 aircraft currently on order with Boeing and Airbus.

The Asia Pacific region will require 19,560 new aircraft over the next two decades as rising passenger traffic, rapid fleet expansion and strong growth in markets such as India and China reshape global aviation demand, Airbus said on Saturday, PTI reported.Presenting its long-term market forecast at the Association of Asia-Pacific Airlines (AAPA) Annual Assembly in Bangkok, Airbus said the region will account for 46 per cent of global demand, with worldwide requirements estimated at 42,520 new aircraft over 20 years.“India and China are driving a major portion of the growth,” said Anand Stanley, President, Airbus Asia Pacific, quoted PTI. The region is expected to see annual passenger traffic grow at 4.4 per cent, well above the global average of 3.6 per cent.India, one of the world’s fastest-growing civil aviation markets, has seen airlines place large aircraft orders as they scale up fleets to meet swelling domestic and international travel.According to Airbus, Asia Pacific carriers will require around 3,500 wide-body aircraft, representing 43 per cent of global demand in larger jets, and nearly 16,100 single-aisle planes, or 47 per cent of worldwide narrow-body deliveries.Airbus said 68 per cent of these deliveries will support fleet expansion, while 32 per cent will replace older, less fuel-efficient aircraft. “The next generation of Airbus wide-body aircraft offers an immediate 25 per cent improvement in fuel efficiency and a corresponding reduction in carbon emissions,” the company added.Stanley said the region is entering an “exciting phase of growth,” driven by expanding route networks, rising penetration of low-cost carriers and ongoing aviation infrastructure development.","Asia Pacific region will require 19,560 new aircraft over the next two decades.

Starbucks to Burger King: US brands rethink China strategy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/starbucks-to-burger-king-us-brands-rethink-china-strategy/articleshow/125352133.cms,"Representative image

Chinese brands speed ahead

US firms cut China dependence as tariff woes linger

Could this phase of joint ventures be different?

Can US brands retain a competitive edge?





US multinationals are increasingly aiming to derisk from China amid souring trade ties. Complaints about red tape and favoritism mask a harsher truth: China's market is brutally competitive and local rivals are winning.When Starbucks opened its first store in Beijing in 1999, it wasn't just selling coffee; it was selling Western aspirations to China's rising middle class. The Seattle-based giant expanded rapidly to dominate China’s premium coffee scene.That early-mover advantage has, however, since eroded. Chinese competitors like Luckin Coffee and Manner have overtaken Starbucks in store count and captured market share, thanks to aggressive pricing, mobile integration and a sharper understanding of Chinese consumer habits. Luckin drives more than 90% of sales via its app, while Starbucks still relies on in-store traffic.Thereported recently that Starbucks' China revenues plunged nearly 19% from 2021 to 2024 to $3 billion (€2.58 billion). The coffee retailer's market share over the past five years has fallen to 14% (2024) from 34%, according to Euromonitor International.With such headwinds affecting its second-biggest market, Starbucks announced this month it would sell a stake in its China operations to a Hong Kong-based private equity firm.The $4 billion deal with Boyu Capital creates a joint venture (JV) in which Starbucks retains 40%.In a parallel move, Burger King announced a new JV with a Beijing-based private equity partner this week, selling a majority stake for $350 million in investment to expand from 1,250 to over 4,000 stores by 2035.It's not just US multinationals. French sports retailer Decathlon is planning to sell about 30% of its China business, a stake valued at €1 billion ($1.16 billion) to €1.5 billion, as it faces pressure from local rivals.For retailers from the United States, the problem is not only slowing demand but the speed and sophistication of local rivals, who launch new products faster and price more aggressively. They also integrate seamlessly into China’s digital ecosystem through mobile platforms like WeChat and Alipay.""A lot of these global names have started to lose their brand power within China,"" Chenyi Lin, an affiliate professor specializing in digital transformation at Insead business school, told DW. ""The new name of the game is agility and adaptability.""Clues to the hyper‑competitive nature of China's consumer market include its 129 electric-vehicle brands, more than 50,000 coffee chains and over 450,000 bubble tea outlets nationwide.Local champions have not only saturated the mass market but are now moving upmarket, offering premium products at competitive prices. Even the extent of competition is fierce, with domestic players challenging foreign firms across food, fashion, electronics and mobility.Jason Yu, Managing Director of CTR Market Research, says Chinese players used to copy from the big multinationals but are now sometimes surpassing them.""In the coffee market, for example, local chains are launching new products much faster, sometimes in a matter of weeks, while Starbucks has to wait months for global approval,"" Yu told DW.Analysts like Yu and Lin expect the JV trend to intensify, as Chinese brands expand globally while continuing to erode the dominance of Western names at home.JVs are just one derisking strategy. Several US manufacturers recalibrated their global supply chains after the COVID-19 pandemic to cut reliance on China due to an over‑reliance on a single source for manufacturing and parts. Apple shifted some of its iPhone production to India, while Nike expanded manufacturing in lower-cost markets in Southeast Asia.Amid uneven growth, US business confidence in China has also hit a historic low, with only 41% of firms optimistic about the next five years, according to industry lobby group AmCham Shanghai's September 2025 survey.Yet rather than exit, Starbucks and Burger King's JVs with private-equity partners should enable them to gain speed, capital and digital integration in a market where local brands now set the pace.""[Chinese JV partners] have the local knowledge, connections and resources to help the multinational brand to be more interconnected with the local ecosystem rather than compete on their own,"" said Yu.Historically, JVs were the standard way for foreign companies to enter China, mandated by law in the 1990s. However, these arrangements can be risky due to uneven regulatory enforcement, limited control over operations and potential intellectual property exposure.Many US firms have had bitter experiences, facing diluted control, slower decision‑making and conflicts with local partners. By the 2000s, many foreign brands in China abandoned them, preferring wholly owned operations. Full foreign ownership in retail has only been allowed since 2022.According to AmCham China, US corporations remain skeptical of JVs. Trade tensions and geopolitics add another layer of uncertainty, the business body said in a recent report. US–China tariffs remain in place on billions of dollars of goods, while rising frictions over Taiwan and other regional issues have also heightened boardroom anxiety.Yu told DW that joint ventures used to be seen as a necessary evil in China, but the latest deals are ""very different"" as they are less about legal necessity and more about strategic advantage.""In a market where Chinese competitors launch new products in weeks and integrate seamlessly into digital platforms, agility is everything. Without these partnerships, many US retailers would struggle to keep pace,"" he said.The greatest risk for US retailers is not competition but leaving China altogether. Walking away from the world’s largest consumer market would mean surrendering long‑term growth. Exiting may look like derisking, but it also risks irrelevance.“If you leave China, you don't just lose sales today — you lose the ability to shape the habits of tomorrow's consumers,"" Lin told DW. ""Once those habits are set by local brands, it is almost impossible for foreign companies to win them back.""",US multinationals are increasingly aiming to derisk from China amid souring trade ties.

AI dashcams for Hawaii

Street sweeper cameras in San Jose

Texas scans 250,000 lane miles





America’s ageing and under-maintained roads are pushing cities and states to adopt artificial intelligence tools that can spot hazards, flag repairs and prioritise fixes in real time — a shift gaining pace amid rising traffic deaths and stretched public works budgets.From Hawaii and Texas to San Jose, local governments are deploying AI-powered dashcams, vehicle-mounted cameras and mobile-based analytics to detect potholes, damaged guardrails, obscured signs and risky driving patterns, replacing manual inspections that can take months, according to AP.Hawaii is giving away 1,000 AI-enabled dashboard cameras under its “Eyes on the Road” initiative, aimed at reversing a jump in traffic deaths. The technology automatically identifies damaged guardrails, missing road signs and worn-out pavement markings, triggering alerts for crews to respond.“This is not something where it’s looked at once a month and then they sit down and figure out where they’re going to put their vans,” said Richard Browning of Nextbase, which developed the system, quoted AP.Roger Chen of the University of Hawaii, who is helping run the programme, said the state’s geography and older infrastructure make maintenance far more challenging.“Equipment has to be shipped to the island… it’s not an easy problem,” he said.Guardrail failures have been a concern for Hawaii. The state last year settled a $3.9 million lawsuit after a driver died in 2020 when his vehicle hit a guardrail that had remained unrepaired for 18 months.By October, Hawaii had recorded its 106th traffic fatality of 2025 — already above the previous year’s total.San Jose is expanding its pilot that uses cameras mounted on street sweepers and parking enforcement vehicles. City staff say the system correctly identified potholes 97% of the time.Mayor Matt Mahan said the project’s success depends on cities contributing data to a shared repository. “We could wait five years for that to happen here, or maybe we have it at our fingertips,” he said.San Jose helped create the GovAI Coalition, launched publicly in 2024, with members from California, Minnesota, Oregon, Texas, Washington and the state of Colorado.Texas, which has more roadway miles than the next two US states combined, is using AI tools to assess street signs, analyse congestion and scan its network.Jim Markham of the Texas Department of Transportation said AI helped flag outdated signs across 250,000 lane miles. “Having AI that can go through and screen for that is a force multiplier,” he said.The state is also using systems like StreetVision, a mobile-based tool that identifies dangerous driving patterns. In one case, data flagged sudden braking on a Washington, D.C. roadway — caused by a bush blocking a stop sign.“That brought me to an infrastructure problem, and the solution… was a pair of garden shears,” said Ryan McMahon of Cambridge Mobile Telematics.Building for autonomous vehiclesExperts say these developments are early steps towards preparing infrastructure for a future where human-driven and autonomous vehicles share the road.Mark Pittman, CEO of Blyncsy, which works on the Hawaii dashcam programme, said most new vehicles will soon come with built-in cameras. “They're now building infrastructure for humans and automated drivers alike, and they need to start bridging that divide,” he said.","Hawaii is giving away 1,000 AI-enabled dashboard cameras under its “Eyes on the Road’ initiative. Texas is using AI to assess street signs, analyse congestion and scan its network. San Jose is expanding its pilot that uses cameras mounted on street sweepers and parking enforcement vehicles.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125351305,imgsize-988567,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"
Walmart leadership change: CEO Doug McMillon to step down next year — Who will succeed him?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/walmart-leadership-change-ceo-doug-mcmillon-to-step-down-next-year-who-will-succeed-him/articleshow/125342505.cms,"McMillon's time at Walmart





Walmart is set to undergo a major leadership change, as the chief executive, Doug McMillon, will retire next year, after spending a little over 10 years at the position.The company has named John Furner, currently CEO and president of Walmart’s US operations, as his successor. Furner will assume the top job on February 1, 2026. Both men have spent decades rising through Walmart’s ranks in various senior positions.The announcement comes as the retail sector grapples with a difficult economic landscape, with tariffs and subdued consumer sentiment hurting margins across the industry. Even so, Walmart has maintained a strong position under McMillon, using its scale in supply chains and grocery to keep prices low, according to CNN.These strengths have helped the company draw customers across income brackets, including households earning more than $100,000 a year, the group it recently identified as its fastest-growing segment.McMillon’s time as CEO coincided with Walmart’s transformation into a far more competitive ecommerce player. He led the retailer’s growth online, expanded Walmart+, and helped position the company as a credible alternative to Amazon.He also served a two-year term as chairman of the Business Roundtable, representing nearly 200 major US companies in Washington.His leadership saw Walmart introduce major policy changes as well.In 2019, the company halted sales of handgun ammunition and ammunition used in military-style assault weapons, while also requesting that customers stop openly carrying firearms in its stores. The shift followed a mass shooting at a Walmart outlet in El Paso, Texas, in which 22 people were killed. McMillon publicly criticised the 6 January attack on the US Capitol and regularly opposed President Donald Trump’s tariffs.However, some initiatives during his tenure fell short of expectations.Walmart’s $3 billion acquisition of Jet.com did not deliver the growth the company sought and was eventually shut down and absorbed into Walmart.com. Efforts to push into upscale fashion, including Bonobos, also struggled to gain traction.McMillon’s career at Walmart began as a store associate, leading to positions at Sam’s Club and Walmart’s international business before his promotion to CEO in 2014. Since then, Walmart’s share price has increased by 300%. “Our family and Board have stated many times that Doug was uniquely qualified to be CEO at the necessary time for Walmart,” said Greg Penner, chairman of Walmart Inc., in a press release.“Doug led a comprehensive transformation by investing in our associates, advancing our digital and eCommerce capabilities, and modernizing our supply chain, resulting in sustained, robust financial performance,” CNN cited the release.Furner, who has overseen Walmart US’ 4,600 stores since 2019, also began at the company as an hourly associate in 1993. His background includes roles at Sam’s Club and Walmart China, and the company credited his contributions in “associate development, digital innovation, and operational excellence.”According to Walmart, McMillon will remain on the board until June next year and will continue advising Furner through the 2027 fiscal year. The retailer also said it will announce a new leader for its US operations soon.","Doug McMillon, Walmart's CEO since 2014, will retire next year.

Warren Buffett's market move: Berkshire takes $4.3 billion stake in Google parent Alphabet; scales back Apple holding,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/warren-buffetts-market-move-berkshire-takes-4-3-billion-stake-in-google-parent-alphabet-scales-back-apple-holding/articleshow/125341466.cms,"Further reductions in Bank of America





Berkshire Hathaway has unveiled a new multibillion-dollar investment in Alphabet while continuing to scale back its long-running position in Apple, marking the final update of its portfolio before Warren Buffett steps down after 60 years as the chief executive.In a filing submitted to the US Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday, the company reported owning 17.85 million shares of Alphabet as of September 30, an investment worth $4.3 billion. During the same quarter, Berkshire reduced its Apple stake from 280 million shares to 238.2 million, as per a Reuters report. Over the years, it has sold nearly three-quarters of the more than 900 million Apple shares it once held.Apple, however, still represented Berkshire’s largest holding at $60.7 billion.The filing detailed the conglomerate’s US-listed equity positions as of the end of September, which together made up most of its $283.2 billion stock portfolio.Alphabet’s arrival as Berkshire’s tenth-largest US holding stood out because of Buffett’s long-held preference for value-focused investments and his general reluctance toward technology companies.He has previously described Apple, the maker of the iPhone, as more of a consumer products business.It was not disclosed whether Buffett, investment managers Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, or CEO-designate Greg Abel made the individual stock selections, though Buffett is usually responsible for larger transactions. At Berkshire’s 2019 shareholder meeting, Buffett and the late Charlie Munger acknowledged missing the opportunity to buy into Google earlier.Buffett pointed to similarities between Google’s advertising model and what worked for Berkshire’s Geico business. “We screwed up,” Munger said. “He’s saying we blew it,” Buffett replied.Alphabet shares rose 1.7% in after-hours trading, a reaction that often follows Berkshire’s disclosure of new stakes, which many investors treat as a sign of confidence.The quarterly update also showed that Berkshire bought $6.4 billion worth of stocks and sold $12.5 billion between July and September, marking its twelfth consecutive quarter as a net seller. The company’s cash holdings climbed to a record $381.7 billion. A significant portion of the sales is believed to have come from Apple.Berkshire also reduced its stake in Bank of America by 6%, extending a selling trend that began in the third quarter of last year. The bank remains the conglomerate’s third-largest stock position. The update further confirmed that Berkshire exited its holding in homebuilder DR Horton, while increasing its stakes in several other companies including Chubb and Domino’s Pizza, Reuters reported.The growing cash reserves come as Buffett prepares to hand leadership of Berkshire’s $1.1 trillion empire to Abel on 1 January. Analysts have noted that Berkshire has been cautious on valuations, avoiding any major acquisition for nearly a decade and not buying back its own shares for more than a year.Beyond its stock market investments, Berkshire controls close to 200 businesses, including the BNSF railway, energy and manufacturing companies, and well-known retail brands such as Dairy Queen, Fruit of the Loom and See’s Candies.","Berkshire Hathaway has unveiled a new multibillion-dollar investment in Alphabet while continuing to scale back its long-running position in Apple.

Trade ties: Switzerland secures US tariff cut to 15%; $200 bn investment push announced,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/trade-ties-switzerland-secures-us-tariff-cut-to-15-200-bn-investment-push-announced/articleshow/125331702.cms,"Pakistan’s Costly Lobbying Blitz Won Access To Trump As India Faced The Harshest Tariffs, Claims NYT





Switzerland has announced a $200 billion investment plan in the US through 2028, coinciding with a breakthrough agreement that will sharply cut US tariffs on most Swiss goods. The deal lowers duties from 39% - the highest imposed on any Western economy - to 15%, aligning Swiss exporters with the tariff regime applied to the European Union, AP reported.Economy Minister Guy Parmelin said in Bern that the agreement was made possible by “new momentum generated by the commitment of the American president” and is expected to take effect in the coming weeks. The White House confirmed the development and said companies from Switzerland and Liechtenstein would account for $67 billion of the planned investment in 2026.A White House fact sheet said the proposed investments would create “thousands of well-paying American jobs across all 50 states” in sectors including pharmaceuticals, machinery, medical devices, aerospace, construction, advanced manufacturing, gold refining and energy infrastructure.The US, which ran a goods trade deficit of more than $38 billion with Switzerland last year, said the agreement “will put us on a path to eliminate that deficit by 2028.” US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer told CNBC that Switzerland would shift some manufacturing of pharmaceuticals, gold smelting and railway equipment to the United States.The tariff rollback follows months of tension after Washington first raised duties on Swiss products to 31% in April as part of its “Liberation Day” tariff actions and then to 39% on July 31.The spike prompted a sustained diplomatic and corporate effort from Bern, which intensified over the past month.Switzerland, already among the largest foreign investors in the US, said the $200 billion plan would be driven by private-sector commitments coordinated under what Parmelin described as “Team Switzerland”. It is not yet clear how much of the investment is new; Roche had earlier announced a $50 billion US investment during the tariff escalation.Several categories of Swiss exports — including pharmaceuticals, chemicals, gold and semiconductor-related goods — had been exempted from the highest tariff slab, but other sectors such as industrial machinery, watches, coffee and cheese remained affected. Parmelin said some tariffs deemed “important”, including in aviation, would be suspended under the new deal, while Switzerland would continue negotiations to ease duties in remaining sectors.The agreement follows an intensive diplomatic campaign, with delegations to Washington led by Swiss President Karin Keller-Sutter and Parmelin. Last week, senior executives from Rolex, gold refiner MKS Pamp and luxury group Richemont met President Donald Trump at the Oval Office to press Bern’s case.",Switzerland has announced a $200 billion investment plan in the US through 2028.

US markets today: Wall Street stays volatile as AI stocks whipsaw; global sell-off deepens across Europe and Asia,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-markets-today-wall-street-logs-second-sharp-fall-as-ai-favourites-tumble-global-indices-mirror-tech-led-slump/articleshow/125330407.cms,"



US stock market stayed volatile on Friday, extending the turbulence from the previous session as major AI-linked stocks swung sharply and triggered another day of unsettled trading across Wall Street.The S&P 500 slipped 0.5% after recovering part of an early 1.3% slide. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 485 points, or 1%, while the Nasdaq composite edged 0.4% lower by 10 a.m. Eastern time, showing little stability after Thursday’s sell-off.AI stocks remained the focal point. Nvidia — which has become the market’s most influential beneficiary of the AI boom — moved from a steep early loss to a small gain of 0.1%, pulling broader indices with it. The company’s stock, which has more than doubled in four of the last five years, is still within sight of records that helped push the S&P 500 to all-time highs late last month, AP reported.“Occasional market drops are the price of the ticket for the ride,” said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management, as traders continued to debate the sustainability of AI-driven valuations. Nvidia’s earnings next week are now seen as critical, with analysts warning that any shortfall could trigger deeper declines because the stock exerts the single largest influence on the S&P 500.Outside technology, Walmart fell 1.5% after announcing that CEO Doug McMillon will retire in January, a move that surprised investors given his role in expanding the retailer’s digital operations.Market sentiment was also shaped by interest-rate uncertainty. The yield on the 10-year Treasury held at 4.11%, unchanged from late Thursday, as traders reassessed the likelihood of another Federal Reserve rate cut in December. While the Fed has lowered rates twice this year, officials have signalled caution due to inflation remaining above the 2% target and delays in economic data caused by the U.S. government shutdown.Bitcoin, which often reacts to shifts in rate expectations, briefly slipped below $95,000 before recovering slightly, far below the nearly $125,000 level seen in October. Gold dropped nearly 3% as higher-rate worries dampened demand for non-yielding assets.Global markets also mirrored Wall Street’s weakness. South Korea’s Kospi tumbled 3.8%, London’s FTSE 100 lost 1.5%, and indices across Europe and Asia traded sharply lower. The sell-off extended pressure on equities from Seoul to Shanghai, where markets fell amid broader caution and sector-specific concerns.","The S&P 500 slipped 0.5% after recovering part of an early 1.3% slide.

"Chinese retail sales: Slowest growth recorded since August 2024; external instability, domestic pressures & more concerns weigh",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/chinese-retail-sales-slowest-growth-recorded-since-august-2024-external-instability-domestic-pressures-more-concerns-weigh/articleshow/125322663.cms,"‘Rare Earths Dispute Settled’: Trump Drops Big China Trade Bombshell Aboard Air Force One





China’s consumer spending lost further momentum in October, with official figures showing the weakest pace of retail growth in more than a year.The numbers, released on Friday highlight the difficulty authorities are facing as they try to lift confidence among households still reluctant to spend.According to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), retail sales were up 2.9% year-on-year last month, easing from the 3% rise recorded in September. The performance marked the slowest expansion since August of the previous year and extended a five-month pattern of moderating growth from the 6.4% high reached in May.At a briefing in Beijing, NBS chief economist Fu Linghui acknowledged the strain on the broader economy.“External instability and uncertainty factors remain numerous, domestic structural adjustment pressures are significant, and the stable operation of the economy faces many challenges,"" he told AFP.China has struggled with muted domestic demand since the end of Covid restrictions, while long-running stress in the property market continues to weigh on households. Economists have argued that a shift towards consumption-driven growth will be essential, as infrastructure investment and exports, once the main engines, offer less support.Even so, officials are pressing ahead with a five percent growth target for 2025, which analysts still consider achievable.October’s spending slowdown coincided with efforts by Beijing and Washington to ease their trade dispute. Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping reached a one-year truce in October aimed at reducing the damage from the long-running trade war. China’s exports have held up through most of the year despite U.S. tariffs, helped by stronger shipments to markets such as Southeast Asia. However, reviving activity at home has been considerably harder.Last month’s Communist Party meeting on economic planning placed emphasis on boosting demand, with leaders calling for the country to “vigorously boost consumption”. A report issued this week by Moody’s Ratings warned that China’s “domestic demand may be slow to revive”, adding that new priorities include “accelerating innovation in strategic technologies and reinforcing domestic demand through structural improvements in income distribution and social safety nets”.Factory output also missed expectations. Industrial production rose 4.9% in October compared with a year earlier, below Bloomberg’s 5.5% forecast and the slowest increase since August of last year.“A key drag came from weaker external demand -- export values and industrial sales for export both weakened significantly,” said Zichun Huang of Capital Economics in a note on the latest data.She further told AFP that “the economy [is expected] to remain weak over the coming quarter” and said the trade truce with Washington “is unlikely to provide much relief”.The country’s housing market continued to deteriorate. New home prices fell year-on-year in 61 of the 70 major cities tracked by the NBS in October, reflecting the ongoing impact of a debt crisis that has gripped the sector since 2020. “The housing sector still clouds the overall outlook,” wrote Sheana Yue, Senior Economist at Oxford Economics.Investment figures also pointed to softening conditions. Fixed-asset investment declined 1.7% in the January–October period from a year earlier, following a 0.5% drop in September when the measure first turned negative.","China's consumer spending lost further momentum in October, official figures show.

South Korea and the US have reached an agreement, covering areas such as nuclear power, tariff concerns, AI and more.South Korean President Lee Jae Myung on Friday announced that the two nations have finalised a joint face sheet agreement on trade and security issues.

Kim also said South Korea will invest $350bn (£265bn) in the United States, including $200bn in cash and $150bn dedicated to shipbuilding.Earlier this year, Trump had imposed a 25% tariff rate on Seoul, which Lee later negotiated down to 15% after Seoul committed the investment in the US and agreed to buy $100bn worth of liquefied natural gas. However as talks continued, the White House raised its demands, with Trump pressing for increased cash investment in the United States.However, now the countries have reached a “mutual understanding” that Seoul’s investment should not lead to “market instability.”Even if the signs of market instability occur, South Korea could seek an adjustment in the payments, asking the US to change the amount and the timing of funding.","South Korea and the US have reached an agreement, covering areas such as nuclear power, tariff concerns, AI and more.

US mortgage rates edge up again: 30-year rate climbs to 6.24% in a week from 6.22%; housing affordability remains a key concern,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-mortgage-rates-edge-up-again-30-year-rate-climbs-to-6-24-per-cent-in-a-week-from-6-22-housing-affordability-remains-a-key-concern/articleshow/125308834.cms,"Representa





The 30-year US mortgage rate rose slightly for the second consecutive week but stayed close to its lowest level of the year.Freddie Mac, quoted by AP, reported on Thursday that the long-term mortgage rate increased to 6.24 per cent from 6.22 per cent the previous week. A year earlier, the rate stood at 6.78 per cent. The rate reached 6.17 per cent a fortnight ago, marking its lowest point in over a year.The 15-year fixed-rate mortgage, often preferred by homeowners for refinancing, edged down to 5.49 per cent from 5.5 per cent last week, compared to 5.99 per cent during the same period last year.Mortgage rates are influenced by several factors, including Federal Reserve policy, and bond market expectations on inflation and the economy. These rates generally track the 10-year Treasury yield, a key benchmark for home loan pricing, which stood at 4.10 per cent by Thursday midday — a slight increase from the previous week.Higher mortgage rates continue to weigh on homebuyers’ purchasing power. Rates have remained above 6 per cent since September 2022, when they began climbing from historic lows, triggering a prolonged housing market slowdown.Sales of existing US homes hit their lowest level in nearly 30 years in 2022.Although activity remained muted this year, sales rose in September to their highest since February as borrowing costs eased.“Lower rates could finally be prompting some buyers to get into the market, which could lead to a surprisingly busy November and December, a time of the year when home sales activity usually slows,” said Lisa Sturtevant, chief economist at Bright MLS.Home purchase loan applications rose nearly 6 per cent last week to their highest level since September, despite the modest rate increase, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.The recent drop in mortgage rates has also benefited homeowners refinancing existing loans. Refinancing applications accounted for about 56 per cent of total mortgage activity last week, a slight dip from the previous week.Rates began easing in July, ahead of the Federal Reserve’s September decision to cut its main interest rate for the first time in a year, amid growing concerns over labour market conditions. Despite another rate cut last month, Fed Chair Jerome Powell cautioned that future reductions were “not guaranteed.”According to CME Group data, traders have trimmed expectations of another Fed rate cut in December to 53 per cent, down from nearly 70 per cent a week earlier.While the Fed does not directly set mortgage rates, its short-term rate moves influence borrowing costs indirectly. When the central bank made its first rate cut in over four years last autumn, mortgage rates unexpectedly climbed above 7 per cent in January 2023, as the 10-year Treasury yield approached 5 per cent.Despite rates falling from their 2025 highs, housing affordability remains a major hurdle following sharp property price increases. The Trump administration’s recent proposal to introduce 50-year mortgages to address the affordability crisis has drawn criticism from several economists and policymakers.","The 30-year US mortgage rate rose slightly for the second consecutive week but stayed close to its lowest level of the year.

Ford CEO highlights widening gap between open jobs and available talent

The fallout of shrinking trade education

What companies like Ford are doing to retain workers

A generational shift and one silver lining





Ford Motor Company CEO Jim Farley has issued one of his starkest warnings yet about America’s labour future, revealing that the company is struggling to fill 5,000 skilled-mechanic roles despite offering salaries of around $120,000. Calling it a “serious problem” for the country, Farley said the shortage of trained workers is no longer an industry issue. It is a national crisis that threatens manufacturing, emergency services and the trades that keep the US economy functioning.Farley shared the figures during an appearance on the Office Hours: Business Edition podcast, saying Ford is not alone in the struggle. Across the US, more than one million skilled-trade and manual-labour positions remain vacant, including jobs in emergency response, trucking, plumbing, electrical work, manufacturing and factory operations.“We are in trouble in our country,” Farley warned, pointing out that many of these jobs form the backbone of American industry. Despite competitive pay, including six-figure packages at Ford, the talent pipeline simply is not keeping up with demand.Recent federal data backs him up. As of August, more than 400,000 manufacturing jobs were open nationwide, even with unemployment rising to 4.3 percent. This is a sign that the labour gap is driven not by job scarcity but by a dramatic decline in the supply of trained workers.One of the biggest problems, Farley argues, is the collapse of trade-based education and apprenticeships. He highlighted that becoming a top-tier mechanic or technician, for example someone who can remove a diesel engine from a Ford Super Duty truck, requires years of training and hands-on experience.“We do not have trade schools,” Farley said, criticising decades of underinvestment in vocational education. “We are not educating the next generation of people like my grandfather, who built a middle-class life.”His reference is personal. Farley’s own grandfather was employee No. 389 at Ford and worked on the Model T, a reminder of how factory and trade work once propelled millions into stable livelihoods.Farley noted that Ford has already taken major steps to make its jobs more appealing. The company eliminated the lowest tier in its wage structure and agreed to a 25 percent pay increase over four years as part of its contract with the United Auto Workers in 2023.Yet even with improved pay and benefits, skilled-trade positions remain among the hardest in America to fill, a sign, Farley says, that the issue is structural, not simply financial.Interestingly, Farley suggested younger Americans may be key to solving the crisis. After years of declining interest in trade jobs, Gen Z is now pushing back against the traditional college-only pathway, with trade-school enrolment rising 16 percent last year, the highest since tracking began in 2018.The surge reflects growing frustration with student debt and a renewed awareness that skilled jobs can offer stability, mobility and strong salaries, often without a four-year degree.But while this trend is encouraging, Farley cautioned that it may not be enough to close the labour gap quickly. Skilled trades require long training curves, and decades of underinvestment mean it will take years to rebuild the pipeline.Farley’s warning is blunt. Without rapid reinvestment in training, apprenticeships and vocational pathways, the US risks choking its own economic engine. From repairing vehicles and maintaining infrastructure to keeping factories running, the trades remain essential and the shortage is becoming too large to ignore.","Ford Motor Company CEO Jim Farley has issued one of his starkest warnings yet about America’s labour future.

Stock markets in the United States were at a low as investors await further economic indicators. The S&P 500 declined by 0.4% in early Thursday trading, moving away from its recent record high achieved in the previous month.The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 41 points, while the Nasdaq composite fell 0.7%. After the longest shutdown in its history lasting six weeks, the US government has resumed operations.Investors are bracing for possible market fluctuations as the government begins issuing crucial updates regarding employment figures and other economic indicators. The United States government has reopened after a six-week shutdown — the longest in its history. While the stock market largely gained during the closure, as it has in previous shutdowns, Wall Street is now bracing for potential volatility as the government resumes publishing key economic data, including job market and inflation reports.Investors are concerned that fresh data could prompt the Federal Reserve to pause its interest rate cuts. Although such cuts typically support economic growth, they also risk fuelling inflation.Wall Street’s recent rally to record highs has been driven in part by expectations of continued rate reductions, and a change in that outlook could weigh on stocks.The “looming data deluge may spur additional volatility in the coming weeks,” said Doug Beath, global equity strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute.Traders have scaled back expectations for another rate cut at the Fed’s next meeting in December, now pricing in a roughly 54 per cent chance — down from nearly 70 per cent a week earlier, according to CME Group data.That shift pushed bond yields slightly higher, a move that typically pressures stock prices. The yield on the 10-year US Treasury rose to 4.10 per cent from 4.08 per cent late Wednesday.On Wall Street, The Walt Disney Co. was among the biggest drags on the market, sliding 8.4 per cent. The entertainment major reported quarterly profits that topped analysts’ estimates, but revenue came in below expectations. Cisco Systems, however, rose 4.6 per cent after posting stronger-than-expected profit and revenue.Overseas, markets were mixed — European indexes fluctuated while Asian markets posted modest gains. Japan’s Nikkei 225 climbed 0.4 per cent even as tech giant SoftBank Group dropped another 3.4 per cent after disclosing it had sold its entire stake in chipmaker Nvidia.Concerns are mounting globally about whether Nvidia and other high-flying artificial intelligence stocks can sustain their massive gains. Their soaring valuations — which have helped drive US markets to record highs despite slowing job growth and persistent inflation — have drawn comparisons to the dot-com bubble of 2000, when the S&P 500 later plunged nearly 50 per cent after the crash.Nvidia fell another 2.9 per cent on Thursday, exerting the heaviest drag on the S&P 500. Other AI-linked stocks also declined, with Palantir Technologies down 2.9 per cent and Super Micro Computer losing 2.6 per cent.","S&P 500 declined by 0.4% in early Thursday trading, moving away from its recent record high achieved in the previous month.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas.

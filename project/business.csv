India’s trade data: Top Highlights

India’s exports to the US have grown in October over September, despite the 50% tariffs imposed by American President Donald Trump on Indian goods. However, the exports to the US for October have registered a decline of 8.58% compared to October 2024. Global Trade and Research Initiative (GTRI) founder Ajay Srivastava notes that US-bound merchandise exports from India reached $6.3 billion in October, showing a 14.5% increase from September, marking the first monthly growth since May despite the 50% tariffs.US President Donald Trump imposed 50% tariffs on India in August, 25% of which is a penalty for India’s crude oil imports from Russia. “Although October 2025 exports of $6.3 billion are 8.6% lower than the $6.9 billion recorded in October 2024, the month-on-month rise from September is a welcome improvement,” says GTRI.“Product-wise data for the USA for October are not yet available, but tariff-exempt sectors such as smartphones and pharmaceuticals may have performed better—though this remains only a tentative assumption. Despite the October rebound, India’s shipments to the US have dropped nearly 28.4% between May and October, erasing more than $2.5 billion in monthly export value,” GTRI adds.India's aggregate exports declined 11.8% year-on-year in October, indicating widespread global demand softness.Among India's top 20 markets, only 5 showed growth in October, with Spain (+43.4%) and China (+42.3%) showing highest increases. Spain led primarily due to enhanced petroleum product exports, whilst China. Hong Kong (+6.00%), Brazil (+3.54%), and Belgium (+2.22%) showed modest improvements.The remaining fifteen destinations saw drops, indicating widespread external challenges. The United States (-8.58%) and UAE (-10.17%) showed moderate declines. Substantial reductions occurred in Singapore (-54.85%), Australia (-52.42%), Italy (-27.66%), UK (-27.16%), and the Netherlands (-22.75%). Additional declines were noted in Malaysia (-22.68%), Korea (-16.43%), Germany (-15.14%), France (-14.28%), Bangladesh (-14.10%), Nepal (-12.64%), South Africa (-7.54%), and Saudi Arabia (-1.12%).Imports of gold rose by 188.2% whilst silver increased by 528.7%, pushing total imports to $73.2 billion, despite gems and jewellery exports declining by 29.5%.Following May 2025's growth of 4.8% to $8.8 billion, exports declined consistently: June showed -5.7% to $8.3 billion, July registered -3.6% to $8.0 billion, August saw -13.8% to $6.9 billion, and September experienced -20.3%, before showing signs of improvement in October.India recorded a significant increase in its merchandise imports, which reached $73.2 billion in October 2025, showing a 16.5% growth. The rise was primarily attributed to substantial increases in precious metals purchases.The country's gold imports witnessed a remarkable increase of 188.2%, totalling $14.7 billion. Similarly, silver imports demonstrated an exceptional growth of 528.7%, amounting to $2.7 billion compared to the previous year's figures.This substantial increase in precious metal imports is particularly significant as India's gems and jewellery exports declined by 29.5% in October. This trend suggests that the imported gold and silver are primarily serving domestic consumption rather than being utilised for export-oriented manufacturing.","India recorded a significant increase in its merchandise imports, which reached $73.2 billion in October 2025, showing a 16.5% growth.

Life Insurance Corporation of India has developed a strong base near the 200-DEMA, indicating that the recent decline is stabilizing around a crucial long-term support. A bullish divergence on the hourly chart suggests that downside momentum is fading and buyers are gradually stepping in.

The long-term MACD has formed a bullish divergence, indicating weakening downside momentum and the possibility of a trend reversal. Price action is gradually showing early signs of recovery, while the 25-period ROC on the hourly chart has turned positive, affirming improving momentum.Given this confluence of technical signals, the stock presents a favourable risk–reward opportunity in the ₹2215–₹2200 zone for a potential move toward ₹2450.Doms Industries Ltd has established a strong base within the ₹2500–₹2580 consolidation zone, reflecting sustained accumulation at lower levels. On 14-11-2025, the stock confirmed a decisive breakout above the ₹2580 mark, signalling fresh buying interest and a likely continuation of the prevailing uptrend.

Legitimate refunds, he added, should be cleared “this month or by December”.Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of an event at Bharat Mandapam, Agrawal said the department is scrutinising a set of returns flagged by the system for questionable claims. “We have also written to taxpayers to file a revised return in case they have forgotten something,” he said.While low-value refunds are being released, the more significant ones are under verification. “We have analysed and found that some wrong refunds or deductions were being claimed.

Gold price prediction: Will gold prices continue to fall? Here's the outlook for coming days,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gold-price-prediction-today-where-are-gold-rates-headed-on-november-18-2025-and-in-the-near-term-mcx-gold-silver-prices/articleshow/125400331.cms,"Dip buying is advisable as December rate cuts can still happen and gold remains well supported on a multitude of factors, says Praveen Singh.. (AI image)

Gold price prediction:

Gold prices are expected to trade in a range in the coming days on global cues and buying on dips may work as a strategy for investors, says Praveen Singh, Senior Fundamental Research Analyst- Currencies and Commodities at Mirae Asset Sharekhan.

The analyst shares his views on gold and silver price outlook and what levels investors should watch out for:

Gold Performance:

In the week ending November 14, spot gold despite plunging 2.64% in the last two trading days on Fed rate cut uncertainty, closed with a weekly gain of nearly 2% at $4,084. Earlier, the yellow metal surged to $4245 on November 13 on inflation concerns as the US Treasury Secretary Bessent said that President Trump's plan of sending $2000 tariff rebate checks was still under consideration, though only those Americans who are earning less than $100,000 per annum would be eligible. Thereafter, shiny metal underwent a huge sell-off on uncertainty over the Fed rate as a host of Fed officials opposed the idea of next Fed rate cut in December. The US data fog due to the government shutdown intensified the uncertainty.

At the time of writing this article, the yellow metal was trading at $4080, down 0.1% for the day as investors turned cautious ahead of the US data deluge. The MCX December gold contract at Rs 123,022 was down 0.44%.

Data roundup:

US Empire manufacturing (November) released on November 17 came in at 18.70 (highest since November) Vs the estimate of 5.80. Construction spending (August) at 0.2% beat the estimate of -0.1%.

China’s data released on November 14 were disappointing. Although retail sales (October) rose 2.9% Vs the estimate of 2.7%, industrial production at 4.9% y-o-y fell short of the forecast of 5.5%. Similarly, the fixed asset investment at -1.7% YTD lagged the forecast of -0.8% as home prices slumped further. Even China’s credit expansion in October was the weakest in more than a year.

US Dollar Index and yields:

At the time of writing this article, the US Dollar Index was hovering around 99.45, up 0.15% for the day.

2-year US yields were steady at 4.61%, while 10-year yields at 4.12% were down by 0.50%.

Gold ETF and COMEX inventory:

As of November 14, total known global gold ETF holdings stood at 97.39 MOz, up 0.15MOz for the week but down 1.55 MOz from the cycle peak of 98.94 MOz observed on October 21. Nonetheless, gold ETF holdings are up 17.54% YTD (452 tons), near 3-year high.

COMEX Gold eligible inventory at 17.90 MOz as of November 14 is down 2% from the cycle peak of 22.45 MOz noted in April in the wake of 'Liberation Day' tariff volatility as investors take delivery.

Fedspeak:

On November 17, the US Federal Reserve Vice Chair Philip Jefferson said he sees increased downside risks to employment, but he cautioned against the December rate cut as interest rates approach neutral.

Last week, Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City President Schmid, Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland President Beth Hammack and Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis President Musalem spoke against December rate cuts as inflation remains elevated. Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco President Mary Daly said it is too soon to decide whether policymakers should lower rates in December. Minneapolis Fed President Kashkari sees current inflation running at 3% to be too high.

Geopolitics watch:

China-Japan tensions have flared due to Japan's PM Sanae Takaichi's statement that if military force were to be used in a Taiwan conflict, including the use of warships, it could be considered as a 'survival-threatening situation for Japan. As Ms Takaichi is expected to maintain her nationalist stance, she may not recant her statement, which means that tensions may continue to run high for quite some time.

Taiwan will distribute millions of civil defence handbooks to households across the island this week to prepare its residents for potential emergencies that also include the possibility of a Chinese attack.

Upcoming data:

Upcoming US data include ADP weekly employment estimate, Import and export price indices, industrial production, NAHB housing market index, TIC flows (Nov. 18), housing starts, FOMC minutes of October meeting (Nov. 19), September nonfarm payroll, weekly jobs, leading index, existing home sales (Philadelphia Fed Business Outlook (Nov. 20), PMIs and Michigan sentiment (Nov. 21). Apart from the US data, focus will also be on Eurozone and UK CPI (Nov. 19) and Eurozone and UK PMIs (Nov. 21).

National Economic Director Kevin Hassett said that the October job report will not include the unemployment rate as the household survey was not completed. October CPI report is unlikely to be released, which would make the Fed’s call in its December 9-10 FOMC meeting a tough task.

Outlook:

China-Japan tensions and disappointing China’s data, particularly property data, are positive for the yellow metal.

Focus will be on US tech earnings and September nonfarm payroll report.

December Fed rate cut probability, currently at 41%, is down sharply from 63% probability as seen on November 12, which is bearish for the metal.

Gold is expected to range trade ahead of tech earnings and September payroll report. Rate cut probability can quickly change in reaction to the US data and comments from the US Administration and the Fed officials.

Dip buying is advisable as December rate cuts can still happen and gold remains well supported on a multitude of factors.

Support is at $4050/$4000/$3936. Resistance is at $4160/$4200/$4260.

Silver:

In the week ending November 14, the grey metal rose quite sharply to test the strong resistance around $55 for the second time as it extended its recovery; however, rate cut uncertainty weighed on the metal, which sent the metal nearly 7% down; however, despite the correction, the grey metal was up 4.67% for the week as it closed at $50.58.

Spot silver, at the time of writing, is trading at $50.91, up nearly 0.6% for the day.

Total known global silver ETF holdings jumped by around 6 MOz (187 tons) last week, which is positive for the metal.

Improved risk appetite on encouraging tech earnings may support the metal.

Support is at $50/$49.30/$47.50. Resistance is at $52.30/$55.

Dip buying is the preferred trade unless gold or risk assets fall sharply lower.

**Note: Positive news on US-India trade deal will support the Indian Rupee, which can exert downside pressure on prices of domestic precious metals

US SHUTDOWN OVER! Heated Debate On Healthcare In HOUSE Ends In SHOCKER For Dems | Watch

according to news agency AP

reported AP

The Federal Aviation Administration will lift all flight-reduction orders at 40 major airports from Monday, allowing airlines to return to normal operations after weeks of shutdown-triggered disruptions.In a joint statement, transportation secretary Sean Duffy and FAA administrator Bryan Bedford said regular schedules can resume from 6 am EST on Monday.The FAA had imposed the unprecedented limits from November 7 due to growing staffing shortages at air-traffic control facilities during what AP described as the country’s longest government shutdown.The cuts initially stood at 4%, rising to 6%, before being reduced to 3% on Friday as staffing improved following the shutdown’s end on November 12,Major hubs in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles and Atlanta were among those affected.Cancellations fell to their lowest point this weekend, with aviation analytics firm Cirium showing fewer than 1% of flights cancelled.The FAA said its safety team recommended lifting the order after “detailed reviews of safety trends and the steady decline of staffing-trigger events.” However, it noted reports of carrier non-compliance during the emergency period and said enforcement options were being assessed.The worst disruption came on November 9, when more than 2,900 flights were cut due to the FAA order, controller shortages and severe weather,Controllers, who worked without pay during the 43-day shutdown, had missed two paychecks.According to NBC News, staffing levels have now “stabilised,” enabling the emergency order to end.Staffing-trigger events dropped sharply—from 81 on November 8 to just one on Sunday.Other restrictions, such as limits on visual flight rule approaches and commercial space launches, will also end.Under the original emergency order, reductions were set to climb to 10%, but officials froze them at 6% on Wednesday before scaling them down to 3% on Friday.Duffy said the agency can now “refocus” on controller hiring and building a “state-of-the-art air traffic control system the American people deserve.”","The Federal Aviation Administration will lift all flight-reduction orders at 40 major airports from Monday.

PhysicsWallah made a strong entry into the stock market on Tuesday, with its shares rising sharply above the issue price and prompting immediate debate among investors over whether to buy, sell or hold.As per ET, the stock opened at Rs 145 on the NSE, about 33 per cent higher than its IPO price of Rs 109.On the BSE, it began trading at Rs 143.10, up 31 per cent, before climbing further to touch Rs 162.05 during the day.Company’s market value reached Rs 43,453 crore.Analysts said the upbeat debut reflects investor confidence in the edtech firm’s brand presence and hybrid teaching model.Shivani Nyati of Swastika Investmart was quoted by ET as saying that the company’s “strong brand recall, affordable test-prep offerings, and fast-growing hybrid model” had contributed to the strong listing.She added that PhysicsWallah benefits from a loyal student base, a broad exam portfolio and a scalable digital content system, though she warned of risks from larger rivals, regulatory uncertainty and profitability pressures.Nyati suggested that allottees may consider booking some profits while keeping part of their holdings for medium-term gains, with a stop-loss at Rs 130.The Rs 3,480–3,481 crore IPO — one of the largest from India’s edtech space — drew nearly twice the subscription by the final day, reported PTI and ET.The offer comprised a fresh issue of about Rs 3,100 crore and a Rs 380 crore offer for sale. QIBs drove demand with 2.86 times subscription, while retail interest stood at 1.14 times and non-institutional bidding was relatively soft.Employees subscribed 3.71 times, supported by a Rs 10 discount.Ahead of the IPO, the company raised Rs 1,563 crore from anchor investors, whose shares remain locked in until mid-December and mid-February.Founded by Alakh Pandey and Prateek Boob, PhysicsWallah has grown from a YouTube channel into a major edtech brand, with 13.7 million subscribers, 4.46 million paid learners and over 300 centres as of June 2025, according to ET.In FY25, revenue rose 51 per cent to Rs 3,039 crore and the company posted a net profit of Rs 243 crore after a loss in FY24. It remains loss-making in cumulative terms and reported a Rs 127 crore loss in Q1 FY26.As per news agency PTI, funds from the IPO will support expansion, technology upgrades, infrastructure and acquisitions.Brokerages offered mixed views before listing. Incred Equities recommended “Subscribe”, citing strong growth in both online and offline segments despite stretched valuations.SBI Securities took a neutral stance, while Swastika Investmart advised avoiding the issue.Analysts cautioned that although the debut was strong, modest subscription levels, competitive pressures and uneven profitability could lead to volatility once the initial excitement settles.PhysicsWallah is the first major pure-play edtech company to list on Indian exchanges, marking a milestone for the sector, reported PTI.","Company’s market value reached Rs 43,453 crore.

This group includes companies like Lenskart, Pine Labs and WeWork India.The smart gains in its stock price puts PhysicsWallah in the company of Groww, a financial tech platform whose stock has gained 88% over its IPO price since listing less than a week ago. Urban Company, another start-up that listed in mid-Sept, is up 41% over its IPO price, exchange data showed.In contrast, the gains in Lenskart, another tech-driven company that's into eyewear solutions, have been modest. Compared to its IPO price of Rs 402, the stock on Tuesday closed at Rs 419, a gain of just 4%. Pine Labs, that listed on Nov 14, is up nearly 9% while WeWork India, that listed on Oct 10, is down a little over 5% from its IPO price.During the day's session Physicswallah listed on the NSE at Rs 145, a 33% gain over its IPO price of Rs 109, touched an intra-day high at Rs 161 and closed the session at Rs 155.

""Now I am in the top 500 listed companies.""Public-market investors are tracking how PhysicsWallah balances its hybrid model as the coaching sector becomes more competitive and regulators scrutinise student welfare.The debut also comes as markets evaluate whether profitable or near-profitable tech companies can revive the digital education story at a time when several internet businesses are preparing to go public.","PhysicsWallah's stock price closed its debut session on the bourses on Tuesday up 44% over its IPO price.

Investors dump stocks of IT companies slow in AI race,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/investors-dump-stocks-of-it-companies-slow-in-ai-race/articleshow/125421402.cms,"Representative image

BENGALURU/ MUMBAI: Balancing growth with profitability is a tricky affair for companies. This is especially true for the fast-changing IT space, where tech-driven disruptions are almost a regular occurrence.In the Indian IT sector, leading firms have been navigating intense technological disruption driven by AI, cloud adoption, and advanced analytics. Some CEOs embraced these shifts and managed to grow shareholder value over the years. Others, however, continue to struggle, and their stock prices have barely moved.Consider this: Among the top Indian IT pack, in the last five years, shareholders in HCL Tech, which navigated the ongoing disruptions in the sector relatively well, saw their holdings jump nearly 95%. Tech Mahindra, Wipro, and Infosys, also among the Indian IT services leaders, followed closely as they also adapted to the changing landscape in the sector. Tech Mahindra's stock price is up nearly 70% during the comparable period, while Wipro is up 39%, Infosys 35%, and TCS 16%. In contrast, the stock price of Cognizant is under pressure and is down 6.5%. For the industry, represented by BSE's IT index, the gain was 67% (US-listed Cognizant is not a constituent of the BSE index).In the more recent past, however, most Indian IT companies have struggled to fully meet evolving global customer demands, and their stocks have underperformed. In the last one year, TCS is down 23%, Infosys down 18%, Wipro 13%, and HCL Tech 13%.According to industry analysts, balancing growth with profitability was not easy for top IT leaders, and many CEOs struggled to strike that equilibrium. In the process, several companies failed to deploy their large cash reserves effectively toward emerging technologies, unlike global peers. For instance, Accenture moved faster to build next-generation capabilities. Accenture highlighted that its early decision in FY23 to commit $3 billion over multiple years to lead in generative AI is paying off. In FY25, revenue from generative and agentic AI tripled from FY24 to $2.7 billion. Among its Indian peers, however, the adoption of AI at an enterprise level is still a major challenge, particularly due to pricing pressure, workforce readiness, and the difficulty of scaling proofs of concept from pilots to revenue.Phil Fersht, CEO of HfS Research, a US-based advisory firm, said investors were rewarding firms that converted AI into measurable productivity. ""Price moves across these major services firms reflect three things more than headline leadership changes: the mix of North America demand, exposure to discretionary deals, and how convincingly each firm is turning AI talk into AI revenue.""In the last year, the BSE IT index is down 14%, while the two benchmark indices are each up: Nifty is up 10% and Sensex 9%. According to Ram Medury, founder & CEO of Maxiom Wealth, a Hyderabad-based wealth management outfit, the Indian IT industry is clearly in transition. “If you look at the IT index, returns have been muted because most of these firms are now very large. Today, they are behemoths — and, in many ways, prisoners of their existing business models,"" he said. “As a fund manager, I've shifted focus to smaller, niche tech firms that use AI to solve specific problems. These players are far nimbler and better positioned to capture the next wave of growth,” Medury added. Larger Indian IT firms need to quickly raise their game at this critical juncture to reward shareholders handsomely.Ramkumar Ramamoorthy, partner at a tech growth advisory firm Catalincs, said that the top 5 India-centric IT services companies, on a combined basis, now have a less than 15% global market share. “So, the headroom for growth is significant. (These) companies should not be obsessed with managing downside risk but be fixated on capitalising on upside opportunities driven by AI and related digital technologies.” Ramamoorthy believes rather than expanding their margins and increasing payout to investors, these companies need to reinvest the margin dollars to reinvent themselves. “If not, they will continue to be challenged for long-term growth, and this will be reflected in their stock price and valuation.”","In the last five years, shareholders in HCL Tech saw their holdings jump nearly 95%.

Toxic smog chokes Delhi: Air quality turns 'severe' as AQI soars to 427 despite GRAP-III measures,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/toxic-smog-chokes-delhi-air-quality-turns-severe-as-aqi-soars-to-427-despite-grap-iii-measures/articleshow/125375137.cms,"Delhi Smog Worsens Two Days After Diwali, AQI Hits Very Poor Levels

(With agency inputs)

NEW DELHI: The national capital woke up to dense smog on Monday, with the average Air Quality Index (AQI) at 359 at 7 am — classified as 'very poor' — despite the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP)-III being in effect across Delhi and the National Capital Region (NCR), according to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB).A thick layer of smog continued to blanket Delhi on Monday, showing little improvement from Sunday’s AQI of 385.Bawana recorded the highest pollution level at 427, falling under the ‘severe’ category, while NSIT Dwarka reported the lowest at 225, according to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB).Iconic areas like India Gate and Kartavya Path were shrouded in toxic smog, with AQI readings of 341 (‘very poor’). Other hotspots included Chandni Chowk (383), RK Puram (366), ITO (394), Punjabi Bagh (384), Patparganj (369), Pusa (365), and Dwarka Sector-8 (356).Meanwhile, Anand Vihar remained engulfed in a layer of toxic smog, with the CPCB reporting an AQI of 383, classified as ‘very poor’.The thick smog, along with deteriorating air quality, mercury continued to hover around the 9 Degree Celsius mark, with some areas recording even lower temperatures.As per CPCB classification, an AQI between 0-50 is considered 'good', 51-100 'satisfactory', 101-200 'moderate', 201-300 'poor', 301-400 'very poor', and 401-500 'severe'.Following the deteriorating air quality in the national capital, the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) III was implemented on November 11 across Delhi by the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM). The measures aim to control emissions through stricter restrictions on construction, vehicular movement and industrial operations.Under GRAP-III, restrictions include a ban on most non-essential construction, limits on BS-III petrol and BS-IV diesel vehicles, suspension of in-person classes for students up to Class 5 with a shift to online or hybrid learning, curbs on industries using non-clean fuels, and a ban on non-emergency diesel generators.Earlier, the Supreme Court directed the governments of Punjab and Haryana to file a status report on the measures taken to curb stubble burning, which contributes to the air pollution crisis in the Delhi-NCR region.A bench of Chief Justice of India BR Gavai and Justice K Vinod Chandran ordered, ""We direct the state of Punjab and Haryana to file a report on what steps are being taken to curb stubble burning.""Since Diwali, air quality in Delhi and the NCR has remained in the 'very poor' to 'severe' categories in several areas, despite Stage III of the GRAP being in effect.","The national capital woke up to dense smog on Monday, with the average Air Quality Index (AQI) at 359 at 7 am.

It was last trading at $92,891 after hitting an intraday low of $89,286.75, reported Reuters.Data from CoinGecko shows the broader digital asset universe has seen about $1.2 trillion in market value erased over the past six weeks. Traders attribute the slide to uncertainty over future US interest rate cuts and a fragile mood across financial markets after an extended rally.“The cascading selloff is amplified by listed companies and institutions exiting their positions after piling in during the rally, compounding contagion risks across the market,” said Joshua Chu, co-chair of the Hong Kong Web3 Association. He warned that “when support thins and macro uncertainty rises, confidence can erode with remarkable speed.”Market specialists said selling pressure has been persistent but is hitting at a time when the buy side looks especially weak. Joseph Edwards of Enigma Securities said many small investors have stayed away since the October crash that triggered liquidations worth $19 billion across leveraged positions.Shares of major crypto-linked firms such as Strategy, Coinbase, Riot Platforms and Mara Holdings have also fallen amid the broader risk-off tone. Standard Chartered Bank has estimated that a further decline below $90,000 could result in about half of publicly listed companies’ bitcoin holdings turning “underwater”, meaning their holdings would be valued below acquisition cost.The corporate sector collectively holds around 4 per cent of all bitcoin and 3.1 per cent of ether in circulation, according to the bank. Strategy, the largest listed holder, has continued to expand its stash. Founder Michael Saylor said the company purchased 8,178 bitcoin on Monday, taking its total to 649,870 tokens acquired at an average price of roughly $74,433 per coin.Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency, has also been under sustained pressure and is now down nearly 40 per cent from its August high above $4,955.“All in all, sentiment is pretty low in crypto and has been since the leverage wipeout of October,” said Matthew Dibb, chief investment officer at Astronaut Capital.","The world’s biggest cryptocurrency, which touched a record high above $126,000 in October, has now surrendered all its gains for 2025.

Early trading saw the S&P 500 fall 0.3%, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropping 361 points and the Nasdaq composite declining 0.6%, AP reported.The weakness followed another volatile stretch for the US market. Home Depot was among the biggest drags after reporting summer-quarter profit below expectations, with the retailer attributing the shortfall to fewer major storms, anxious consumers and a continuing slowdown in the housing market. The company’s shares fell 3.1% and it cut its fiscal 2025 adjusted earnings guidance while raising its sales growth outlook.The rout in artificial-intelligence-related stocks continued to shape market direction. Nvidia, whose shares have fallen 8.6% this month, slipped another 1.1% ahead of its earnings announcement due on Wednesday after a 1.9% decline on Monday. Other chipmakers—including Micron, Intel and Qualcomm—lost between 1% and 2%.Among the tech giants, Microsoft slid 1.5% while Amazon dropped 1.8%.Cloudflare shares also weakened after a technical issue at the internet infrastructure provider triggered global outages affecting services such as ChatGPT. European and Asian markets followed Wall Street lower, with major indices in Germany, France and the UK down 1.4% by midday.Futures trading mirrored the cautious mood, with S&P 500 and Dow futures down 0.6% and 0.7% respectively, and Nasdaq futures retreating 0.7%.Investors are also bracing for the delayed US employment data, scheduled for release on Thursday after the prolonged government shutdown. The update is expected to influence the US Federal Reserve’s next interest rate move. While markets had anticipated continued rate cuts to support a weakening labour market, officials have pointed to the risk of worsening inflation, which remains above the 2% target.A strong jobs report could delay further rate cuts, while particularly weak numbers may raise concerns about economic momentum. Fed policymakers have also cited limited data availability due to the shutdown as a reason for adopting a more cautious stance.Across Asia, markets retreated sharply. Japan’s 30-year government bond yield surged to 3.31% as Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi prepared higher government spending plans and delayed efforts to reduce public debt.

AI’s impact on hiring and productivity

Trump administration’s stance and recent AI debate

Affordability concerns and grocery price debate

Artificial intelligence could be boosting worker productivity to a level where companies feel less pressure to hire, senior Trump administration economic adviser Kevin Hassett said on Monday.Speaking on CNBC’s Squawk Box, the National Economic Council director said he has noticed “mixed signals in the job market” but “really, really positive signals in the output markets,” as per CNBC.Hassett pointed to strong US GDP growth in the second quarter of 2025 and suggested that firms may be experiencing a “quiet time in the labour market” because AI is making staff significantly more efficient.According to CNBC, he said companies may feel they “don’t necessarily have to hire the new kids out of college and so on.”However, Hassett stressed that any AI-driven cooling in the job market would likely be short-lived.He explained that rapid output and income growth would allow the free market to “work out” these imbalances as new spending avenues emerge.While concerns about AI replacing entry-level roles are not new, they are rarely voiced by the Trump administration, which has strongly promoted the technology, reported CNBC.President Donald Trump has issued several executive orders aimed at reducing regulatory hurdles and expanding AI infrastructure such as data centres.Earlier this month, Trump’s AI and cryptocurrency “czar” David Sacks said there would be “no federal bailout for AI.”His comment followed OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar’s call for a federal “backstop” to support infrastructure investments, which she later walked back, reported CNBC.Hassett’s remarks also come as Trump and his allies try to shift attention to affordability after Democrats gained ground by focusing on cost-of-living issues, according to CNBC.He acknowledged that grocery prices have not fallen during Trump’s second term, despite the president’s claims. Hassett said Americans are still “trying to dig out from the big hole that was dug by the previous administration’s policies,” though he argued that prices have “gone up almost not at all” since Trump returned to office and that “purchasing power has gone up.”",National Economic Council director Kevin Hassett spoke on CNBC's Squawk Box.

What exactly did Berkshire buy?



Why is this investment important?

Who actually made the call—Buffett or his deputies?

What else was happening in Berkshire’s portfolio?

What does this mean going forward?

Alphabet’s shares climbed sharply this week after Warren Buffett ’s Berkshire Hathaway revealed a multibillion-dollar investment in the Google parent.The move is significant because Buffett has rarely backed fast-growing tech firms. Filings showed Alphabet is now one of Berkshire’s top ten holdings.A quarterly 13F filing showed Berkshire held around $4.3 billion worth of Alphabet shares as of 30 September.According to CNBC, this makes Alphabet the conglomerate’s 10th-largest holding.Berkshire purchased 17.85 million shares, valued at $4.93 billion based on last Friday’s close.Buffett has been cautious about traditional tech stocks for decades.As per CNBC, he only viewed Apple—Berkshire’s largest investment—as a consumer-products company rather than a tech business. This makes the Alphabet purchase unusual and closely watched.Alphabet is the best-performing “Magnificent Seven” stock this year, up 46%, according to Reuters.Even with those gains, it trades at a lower valuation than Microsoft, Nvidia or Broadcom, which may have appealed to Berkshire.While Buffett approves major decisions, CNBC reported that the Alphabet move likely came from portfolio managers Todd Combs or Ted Weschler.They have been behind several earlier tech-leaning investments, including Amazon in 2019.Both influence growing parts of Berkshire’s $300 billion equity portfolio.Why does Alphabet fit Berkshire’s value approach?Analyst quoted by CNBC said that Alphabet’s strong cash flows, dominant market position and more modest valuation compared to other AI-driven companies made it attractive.Google Cloud has also shifted from a loss-making unit to a key profit contributor. CFRA analyst Angelo Zino said Alphabet offers “high free cash flow potential” at a valuation Berkshire may find comfortable.According to Reuters, Berkshire trimmed its stakes in Apple and Bank of America during the same quarter. Its cash reserves hit a record $381.7 billion, showing Buffett’s cautious view on expensive markets.Against that backdrop, Alphabet appears to be one of the few large investments Buffett’s team was willing to make.Analysts quoted by Reuters said the Alphabet purchase aligns more closely with Berkshire’s traditional value-driven strategy than other AI-led tech stocks.The deal also comes as Buffett prepares to hand leadership to Greg Abel at the end of 2025, making it likely one of the final major portfolio moves under his tenure.Alphabet’s strong position in AI, its large advertising revenue base and its expanding cloud business appear to have given Berkshire enough confidence to make a rare big bet in the technology sector.",Berkshire Hathaway revealed a multibillion-dollar investment in the Google parent. The move is significant because Buffett has rarely backed fast-growing tech firms.

Big Relief For Indians: Donald Trump Clarifies $100K H-1B Fee Won’t Apply To Existing Visa Holders

Why are H-1B visas important?



Who benefits from H-1B visas in the US?

Approved H-1B petitions and denial rates for initial employment

Approved H-1B petitions and denial rates for continuing employment

Do H-1B visa restrictions really help the US? No!

Denial rate for H-1B petitions

H-1B visas, on which the Donald Trump administration is imposing increasing restrictions, are actually beneficial for the US economy and unlike some people who claim that they constitute ‘cheap labour’, evidence seems to suggest otherwise, says National Foundation for American Policy (NFAP) in its latest report.US President Donald Trump had in September announced a $100,000 fee for fresh H-1B visa applicants, a move that has added growing uncertainty to the employment prospects of several foreign nationals, including Indians, who wish to work in America. The Trump administration is also mulling a new wage-weighted system as selection criterion for H-1B visas, doing away with the current lottery-based system.The US Citizenship and Immigration Services has released guidance confirming that the $100,000 fee would be levied only on new H-1B visa holders coming into US and not people change from one visa category to another without leaving the United States; for example it would not be applicable if an individual moves from F-1 student status to H-1B status.A proposed rule by the Trump government, published in September 2025 would disadvantage international students in the H-1B lottery selection, NFAP says, arguing that increasing restrictions may be counter-productive. But first let’s understand why H-1B visas are important:H-1B visas are important: they are the route to getting highly skilled foreign nationals to work in the US. They serve as the main pathway for these foreign nationals, including international students, to get long-term employment in America, build their careers and potentially obtain permanent residency and citizenship in the US.The pool from which employers select highly skilled professionals with recent advanced degrees in key technical fields is composed largely of foreign nationals, says NFAP.Statistics quoted in the NFAP report show that international students actually constituted a huge 71% of full-time graduate enrolment in computer and information sciences programmes and 73% in electrical and computer engineering courses at US universities!USCIS data indicates that nearly two-thirds of recent H-1B visa holders have master's degrees or higher qualifications. Without the H-1B visa status, foreign nationals often must relocate to countries like China, India, Canada or other nations, the report says. The NFAP analysis indicates approximately 700,000 individuals currently reside and work in the United States under H-1B status.Importantly, critics of the H-1B visa system and proponents of increasing curbs on employing foreign nationals in the US argue that it is majorly ‘outsourcing’ firms that draw the maximum benefits from this category of visas. However the FY 2025 numbers present a completely different picture!In fiscal year 2025, Amazon bagged the highest number (4,644) of approved H-1B petitions for initial employment, whilst Meta Platforms, Microsoft and Google followed with 1,555, 1,394 and 1,050 approvals respectively, as per NFAP's examination of USCIS records. H-1B petitions for initial employment are primarily for new employment.This is actually the first time when these four big American technology firms have dominated the top positions for new H-1B petition approvals. According to NFAP, the recruitment activities are on the back of $380 billion investment in AI and associated capital expenditure in 2025.A notable trend has emerged: only three India-based firms appeared amongst the top 25 employers for initial employment H-1B petition approvals in FY 2025. The seven leading India-based companies secured only 4,573 initial employment H-1B approvals in FY 2025, showing a 70% reduction from FY 2015 and 37% decrease from FY 2024.Regarding continuing employment H-1B petitions in FY 2025, Amazon led with 14,532 approvals, followed by TCS (5,293), Microsoft (4,863), Meta Platforms (4,740), Apple (4,610) and Google (4,509). These figures do not correspond to individual employees, as H-1B holders may receive multiple continuing employment approvals within a year due to location changes. Combining initial and continuing employment figures for employers presents an inaccurate representation, says NFAP.Given the FY 2025 H-1B numbers, H-1B critics will likely need a new argument, says NFAP.NFAP is of the view that the fundamental issue with the H-1B category of US visas lies not in its organisation-wse distribution, but rather in its restrictive annual cap of 85,000! This cap is just 0.05% of the American workforce! This limit has consistently proved insufficient for over 20 years, NFAP says.NFAP points out that Trump’s first-term policies seem to be shaping the ongoing move for enhanced restrictions for foreign nationals working in the US. This could lead to higher denial rates for H-1B visas, causing challenges for businesses, cautions NFAP.According to USCIS data, H-1B professionals in computer-related roles earned an average yearly salary of $136,000 and a median of $125,000 in FY 2024, contradicting assertions that these workers constitute ‘cheap labour’.“Some policymakers who favor restrictive immigration policies have argued that foreign-born scientists and engineers may be “cheap labor.” However, the average annual salary for an H-1B visa holder in computer-related occupations in FY 2024 was $136,000, and the median salary was $125,000, according to USCIS statistics,” it says.The USCIS data show H-1B visa holders are paid high salaries, and it contradicts the idea that these are low-skilled people since employers would not pay people with low skills such high salaries,” says Mark Regets, economist at NFAP.Data and economics indicate it is a mistake to assume a fixed number of jobs and that foreign-born scientists and engineers prevent US engineers and computer specialists from gaining jobs.“The number of US-born workers employed in computer science and mathematical occupations increased by over 2.7 million, or 141%, between 2003 and 2024,” according to a National Foundation for American Policy analysis of Bureau of Labor Statistics data quoted by NFAP.Industry experts have emphasised that IT service providers that utilise H-1B visas actually contribute positively to US companies and consumers through enhanced productivity and competitiveness.NFAP notes that there is a valid reason why US companies are willing to pay such large sums for acquiring talent through H-1B visas - “The services provided, particularly by more established companies, are specialized and often involve substantial project-oriented contracts for several hundred million dollars or even $1 billion to provide technical skills, services or knowledge that US companies do not possess in-house or that do not make sense to staff in-house,” says NFAP.In a May 2020 study by the National Foundation for American Policy, economist Madeline Zavodny concluded, ""H-1B visa holders do not adversely affect US workers. On the contrary, the evidence points to the presence of H-1B visa holders being associated with lower unemployment rates and faster earnings growth among college graduates, including recent college graduates.""Limiting H-1B visas appears to push employment and innovation beyond US borders. ""[A]ny policies that are motivated by concerns about the loss of native jobs should consider that policies aimed at reducing immigration have the unintended consequence of encouraging firms to offshore jobs abroad,"" says research by Britta Glennon, an assistant professor at the Wharton School of Business at UPENN.""When US firms are denied H-1Bs, they go abroad, setting up new foreign affiliates and hiring talent there instead of in the US,"" Glennon notes. ""For the most global multinational companies, this is at almost a 1:1 rate. The results demonstrate an important unintended consequence of immigration restrictions: the movement of jobs and talent abroad, with major implications for US competitiveness.""Research by economist Giovanni Peri and colleagues indicates that the current low H-1B caps prevent firms from generating hundreds of thousands of positions for US workers by limiting business expansion and other opportunities.“Policies toward high-skilled foreign nationals in America remain more restrictive than those of other countries that the United States competes with for talent. The Trump administration is making US immigration policies more restrictive by implementing measures that officials proposed or enacted during Donald Trump’s first term. The policies could lead to fewer international students attending US universities and more companies sending work and resources outside the United States,” NFAP says.Though Donald Trump seems to have taken a U-turn a few days ago, contending that US needs 'certain talent', it remains to be seen whether the stance on H-1B visa restrictions will change.","US President Donald Trump had in September announced a $100,000 fee for fresh H-1B visa applicants.

Asian markets fell on Tuesday as caution spread across global equities ahead of several delayed US economic releases and shifting expectations around the Federal Reserve’s next move.The weakness followed a tech-led slide on Wall Street overnight, with investors watching closely for Thursday’s September nonfarm payrolls report to gauge the strength of the US economy.Stocks across the region opened lower. As per news agency Reuters, MSCI’s broad Asia-Pacific index excluding Japan was down 0.7%, while Japan’s Nikkei tumbled more than 2%.The Topix slipped 0.6%, South Korea’s Kospi dropped 0.64% and the Kosdaq 0.58%. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index declined 0.86%, and Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 lost 0.76%. Mainland China’s CSI 300 traded flat.Sentiment in Japan was also shaped by Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi’s first meeting with Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda since taking office, as per Reuters.Analysts at JBWere said markets were keen to see how the new leadership would balance easy-policy preferences with Ueda’s recent signals of a possible rate hike as early as next month.Takaichi and finance minister Satsuki Katayama have publicly backed keeping rates low until inflation stays near the BOJ’s 2% target.As per CNBC, Bond yields in Japan continued to climb, with the 20-year yield rising to 2.78%—its highest since 1999—while the 10-year yield hit 1.751%.Overnight in the US, the Dow lost 557 points, or 1.18%, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq fell 0.92% and 0.84%.Nvidia slipped nearly 2% ahead of its earnings due Wednesday, dragging other tech shares lower amid growing concerns about stretched valuations.Investors have dialled back expectations of a Fed rate cut in December, as per Reuters, with markets now pricing in roughly a 40% chance, down from over 60% earlier this month.The cautious mood kept the dollar index 0.2% higher at 99.545, while the yen weakened to 155.29 per dollar, its softest since early February.

TOI correspondent from Washington

India Brushes Off US Threats, Doubles Russian Oil Imports Amid Global Tensions | Watch

: In a landmark move to both bolster its energy security and mollify MAGA-infused Washington, India will buy 2.2 million tonnes of liquid petroleum gas (LPG) from the United States under an initial one-year contract.The agreement marks the first structured purchase of American gas for the Indian market, with global giants Chevron, Phillips 66, and TotalEnergies Trading SA expected to ferry the LPG to India in 48 very-large gas tankers. Effective from January 2026, with possible extensions, the state-run oil majors Indian Oil Corporation (IOCL), Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL), and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) will handle supplies at the Indian end.“A historic first! One of the largest and the world’s fastest growing LPG market opens up to the United States,” India’s minister for petroleum and natural gas announced on social media on Monday, even as US President Donald Trump threw his support behind lawmakers drafting a bill that would sanction countries purchasing Russian oil and gas to the tune of 500 per cent.The legislation still has some distance to go. US Senators Lindsey Graham and Richard Blumenthal, who first introduced the bill in April 2025, said in a joint statement on Sunday that “The ultimate hammer to bring about the end of this war will be tariffs against countries, like China, India and Brazil, that prop up Putin’s war machine by purchasing cheap Russian oil and gas.”India buys most of the gas it imports from the Gulf, mainly Qatar, UAE and Saudi Arabia, even as it is whittling down oil purchase from Russia to free itself from the punitive 25 per cent additional sanctions tariff related to this.The volume of U.S export represents only 10per cent of India's total annual LPG imports projected at around 22 MTPA to meet surging domestic demand as more Indians transition to the use of LPG. This effectively leaves room for more purchases subject to competitive pricing.Puri said the purchase is based on using Mount Belvieu – the premier US LPG pricing hub – as the benchmark. While exact figures remain confidential, analysts peg Mont Belvieu propane at roughly $650–$700 per metric tonne and butane at $550–$600 per tonne as of November 2025.For Indian consumers, this translates to subsidized 14.2-kg cylinders under the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY) staying affordable at Rs 500–Rs 550, thanks to government absorbing over Rs 40,000 crore in subsidies last year amid 60per cent global price spikes.“Our PSU oil companies have been providing LPG at the lowest global prices to all our mothers and sisters. Even as global prices soared by over 60per cent last year, Modi Ji ensured that our Ujjwala consumers continued to receive LPG cylinder at just Rs 500-550 whereas the actual cost of the cylinder was over Rs 1100,” Puri said.The LPG deal forms part of a nascent bilateral trade agreement (BTA), with five negotiation rounds completed and a first-phase closure imminent, as confirmed by Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal. ""This isn't just about energy; it's about fair, equitable ties,"" Goyal stated last week at the Udyog Samagam 2025 forum. Trump recently noted the two nations are ""pretty close"" to a ""fair trade deal,"" potentially easing tariffs in exchange for boosted US energy inflows.India's push for diversification stems from its heavy reliance on imports, which met over 67per cent of LPG needs in 2024—a sharp rise from 47per cent in 2015—driven by stagnant domestic production and redirection of refinery output to higher-margin petrochemicals. Total consumption hit 28.7 million tonnes last year, with monthly averages at 2.6 million tonnes in early 2025, fueled by PMUY's expansion to 10.3 crore beneficiaries and a total domestic customer base of 33 crores.Historically, India has leaned on Gulf partners for over 80per cent of its LPG imports. Qatar dominates with a 27per cent share (down from 32 percent in 2012–13), followed by the UAE at 26per cent and Saudi Arabia at 19per cent. These Gulf majors have been reliable, but volatility—exacerbated by Red Sea disruptions and OPEC+ cuts—prompted the US outreach, according to New Delhi.Months of talks, including site visits by IOCL, BPCL, and HPCL executives to American facilities, paved the way. ""We've shielded households from shocks; now, we're securing supplies,"" Puri emphasized on X, crediting Prime Minister Narendra Modi's vision.","India will buy 2.2 million tonnes of liquid petroleum gas (LPG) from the United States under an initial one-year contract.

Alphabet experienced a striking ascent on the news of Berkshire Hathaway’s investment.

Wall Street opened the week on a subdued note on Monday as investors braced for Nvidia’s much-watched earnings and the first US government economic data release in six weeks. Trading was mixed in early hours, with futures on the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average slipping less than 0.1 per cent, while Nasdaq futures nudged up by a similar margin.Alphabet shares jumped more than 4 per cent after Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway disclosed in a regulatory filing that it had taken a stake of more than $4 billion in the Google parent.Nvidia, which recently became the first firm to briefly cross a $5 trillion market capitalisation, will release quarterly results on Wednesday after market close. The stock has eased in recent weeks amid warnings that AI-linked valuations may have overheated.The earnings print is expected to be a key test. Analysts said companies often counter overvaluation worries by “delivering solid growth in profits”, raising the stakes for Nvidia’s summer quarter.A string of major US retailers — Home Depot, Target and Walmart — will also post results this week, offering clues to consumer strength in the absence of official economic indicators.The 43-day federal shutdown halted key releases, leaving the Federal Reserve and markets without fresh numbers on jobs, inflation and GDP since late summer.The Labor Department will publish September hiring and unemployment data on Thursday, marking the end of the data drought.European markets slipped at midday, with Germany’s DAX down 0.6 per cent, France’s CAC 40 off 0.5 per cent, and the UK’s FTSE 100 easing 0.2 per cent.Asia saw mixed moves. Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 edged down 0.1 per cent to 50,323.91 after Japan reported an annualised 1.8 per cent contraction in the July–September quarter. The dollar strengthened to 154.86 yen from 154.58 yen.Chinese markets declined, with Hong Kong’s Hang Seng dropping 0.7 per cent and the Shanghai Composite down 0.5 per cent.Analysts pointed to rising regional tensions after China reacted sharply to Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi’s comments suggesting Tokyo could respond militarily if Beijing moved against Taiwan.“China’s escalation against Japan over Prime Minister Takaichi’s Taiwan remarks has moved from a diplomatic irritant to a consequential macro input, with markets now forced to reprice Asia’s near-term risk curve,” said Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management.South Korea’s Kospi surged 1.9 per cent to 4,089.25 on strong buying in chip stocks following announcements of AI cooperation with Nvidia.

Air Côte d’Ivoire confirmed an order for four Embraer E175 jets.

Later, Air Senegal finalised an order for nine Boeing 787-8 MAX aircraft.

Dubai’s biennial Air Show opened on Monday with a headline announcement from hometown carrier Emirates, which placed a $38-billion order for 65 Boeing 777-9 aircraft, reinforcing its push to expand long-haul capacity amid record earnings and rising traffic through the city’s East-West hub, AP reported.The new order takes Emirates’ total commitment for the upcoming 777-9 to 270 aircraft, cementing its position as Boeing’s largest customer for the wide-body jet, even as the programme faces repeated delays. The agreement also includes GE Engines, bundled into the total deal value.Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum, chairman and chief executive of Emirates, described the purchase as a vote of confidence in the long-term partnership with Boeing and GE.“It’s a long-term commitment that supports hundreds of thousands of high-value factory jobs, and it reinforces our 40-year partnership with Boeing and GE,” he said. Emirates remains the world’s largest operator of the Boeing 777 fleet, all powered by GE engines.Sheikh Ahmed said he expected Emirates to remain the biggest 777 operator “for the years to come”, adding that airlines needed larger aircraft to keep pace with global travel growth.He said the carrier looked forward to receiving its first 777-9 from the second quarter of 2027, pointedly glancing at Boeing as he mentioned the date.Boeing Commercial Airplanes president and CEO Stephanie Pope did not specify an entry-into-service timeline but said the jet would “further support Emirates' mission to connect people and places around the globe like never before”.Officials took no questions from the media following the announcement.New deals and regional ordersBoeing also announced a series of additional orders at the event:Dubai Air Show opens amid booming travel, military interestThe 2025 edition of the Air Show comes as Dubai witnesses unprecedented passenger volumes.

Donald Trump Signals Harsh Sanctions On Russia’s Trading Partners With India On List For Oil Trade

A new analysis by the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies has cautioned that the worldwide effort to move away from Russian gas is creating fresh instability in the market, largely because of tighter supplies and shifting political alignments.The report says that cutting reliance on Moscow has pushed several countries to depend more heavily on the United States, describing the shift as an increased dependence on “an increasingly volatile ally in the US.”According to news agency ANI, sanctions on Russian energy have pushed global demand towards American LNG, placing the US in a position to dominate LNG supply growth. Its export capacity is expected to almost double by 2030, at a time when the global gas market is already facing upheaval.The study warns that although a new wave of LNG supplies may ease pressure later this decade, price swings are likely to worsen in the near term.Gas is increasingly being used to back up renewable power, and delays in new investments could trigger shortages. Such pressures, the report notes, could fuel political friction, especially if major producers accuse the EU of adding regulatory and pricing uncertainties.The institute also highlighted concerns over Washington’s push to expand markets for US LNG — a trend particularly strong under the Trump administration — saying this could politicise gas trade and undermine long-term buyer confidence.The long-term outlook for natural gas is already uncertain, with renewables challenging it in Europe and China, and coal remaining competitive in India and parts of Asia.Another risk flagged in the report is the United States’ influence over global energy flows through the dollar-clearing system, which enables it to impose unilateral or secondary sanctions.This power, the study says, increases the chance of disruptions and is encouraging countries like Russia, China, India and Iran to explore trade in local currencies.Globalised gas markets have further amplified these vulnerabilities. As per ANI, interconnected benchmarks now mean that a supply shock in one region can instantly raise prices elsewhere. After the Ukraine conflict, European and Asian gas prices effectively converged, turning Europe’s energy crisis into Asia’s.The volatility has raised concerns among major Asian buyers, including China and India, about whether LNG can be relied upon for power generation and industrial use in the long run.India on Monday announced that it signed a significant one-year agreement to source 2.2 million tonnes of LPG from the United States — around 10 per cent of its annual imports — as part of its wider strategy to diversify fuel supplies.The deal comes amid strained India–US ties following President Donald Trump’s decision to raise tariffs on India to 50 per cent.","New analysis by the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies has cautioned that the worldwide effort to move away from Russian gas is creating fresh instability in the market.

Pakistan’s central bank has introduced new restrictions to reduce the cash outflow of US dollars and protect the value of the Pakistan rupee.The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has instructed banks not to hand out cash dollars to anyone who does not hold a foreign currency (FCY) account, meaning customers without such accounts can no longer buy cash dollars from banks.According to new agency PTI, the SBP circular states that all foreign currency sale transactions meant for deposits will now be completed through bank-to-bank transfers.The circular said: “In order to promote cashless economy , it has been decided that, henceforth, all FCY sale transactions to resident citizens of Pakistan for the purpose of deposit into FCY account will be executed through account-to-account transfer.”This effectively ends cash payouts for dollar purchases intended for deposit.Banks will now transfer dollars directly into a purchaser’s FCY account, while exchange dealers can give only $500 in cash without verification.Any higher amount will require customers to present documents, state their purpose, and complete biometric verification. Even those travelling for Hajj, Umra or studying abroad will need full documentation to buy more than $500.Exchange companies must also follow stricter procedures.Sardar Naseem of Galaxy Exchange was quoted as saying by PTI that customers buying dollars for deposit will receive cheques instead of cash, which banks will then credit to FCY accounts.He said the move is aimed at controlling the outflow of dollars and preventing money changers from keeping large dollar reserves in bank accounts.Currency experts cautioned that buyers of euros or pounds may face delays, as cheques issued for these currencies could take five to seven days to clear.Pakistan’s financial pressures have been mounting, as the country’s total public debt climbed to $286.832 billion (PKR 80.6 trillion) by June 2025, nearly 13% higher than the previous year.According to the finance ministry’s Annual Debt Review, the debt-to-GDP ratio rose to about 70%, driven largely by weaker-than-expected economic growth and subdued inflation.Domestic debt jumped 15% year-on-year while external debt increased by 6% to $91.8 billion, supported by IMF disbursements, a $1 billion ADB-guaranteed commercial loan, and fresh inflows from multilateral lenders.Provincial debt also rose, led by Punjab and Sindh, while overall 84% of the country’s external public debt sits with the federal government.Despite some signs of recovery—such as a current account surplus, higher reserves of $16.64 billion, and modest GDP growth—the rising debt burden underlines Pakistan’s fragile economic position.",State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has instructed banks not to hand out cash dollars to anyone who does not hold a foreign currency (FCY) account. Customers without FCY accounts can no longer buy cash dollars from banks.

"Global equity outlook: Goldman Sachs projects 7.7% decade returns; earnings, payouts fuel forecast",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/global-equity-outlook-goldman-sachs-projects-7-7-decade-returns-earnings-payouts-fuel-forecast/articleshow/125381682.cms,"Representative image

Global equities are expected to generate strong long-term gains even though market valuations remain high, with Goldman Sachs forecasting an annualised return of 7.7 per cent in US Dollar terms over the next decade.The projection comes from the investment bank’s latest Global Strategy Paper titled Building Long-Term Returns: Our 10-Year Forecasts.According to news agency ANI, Goldman Sachs said its estimate is close to the historical median and is supported by structural factors such as nominal growth, profitability and shareholder payouts.The bank noted, “We expect global equities to deliver a 10-year total return of 7.7 per cent in USD,” despite pricey starting valuations.The firm’s building-block model derives long-term returns from earnings growth, dividend yield and valuation changes.Earnings remain the key driver, with Goldman Sachs expecting global earnings — including buybacks — to grow at roughly 6 per cent annually, ANI reported.Dividends are likely to contribute about 2 per cent, while valuations may slightly weigh on returns over the decade.Goldman Sachs acknowledged that current market valuations, at around 19 times forward earnings, are elevated but said “valuation, however, is not the whole story” and pointed to higher margins and improved return on equity as support for these levels.Regional returns over the next 10 years are expected to vary significantly. Emerging Markets are projected to deliver the highest returns at 10.9 per cent, driven by strong earnings growth in China and India.Asia ex-Japan may generate 10.3 per cent, supported by 9 per cent earnings growth and a 2.7 per cent dividend yield.Japan is forecast to give 8.2 per cent, helped by reforms and 6 per cent EPS growth. Europe may return 7.1 per cent, with about half coming from dividends and buybacks, as per ANI.The United States is expected to lag at 6.5 per cent due to expensive valuations and modest dividend payouts.While the report does not directly model the impact of artificial intelligence, Goldman Sachs said AI could offer further upside, with benefits likely to be broad-based rather than limited to US technology companies.The bank added that its baseline does not factor in “extreme shocks or blue-sky optimism”, though alternative scenarios range from 3.6 per cent to 10.5 per cent annualised returns.Despite uncertainties, Goldman Sachs said investors can anticipate favourable long-term outcomes: “We expect global equities to deliver solid long-term returns despite elevated valuations.”","The projection comes from the investment bank’s latest Global Strategy Paper titled Building Long-Term Returns: Our 10-Year Forecasts.

NEW DELHI: More than 1.14 lakh startups in India have created over 12 lakh jobs so far, the finance ministry said in its latest review of the Indian economy.In the report titled, ‘The Indian Economy: A Review January 2024’, the Department of Economic Affairs said that the 1.14 lakh startups recognised by the government under the 'Startup India initiative’ created more than 12 lakh jobs (as of October 2023).The state-owned e-commerce platform Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) clocked more than 63 lakh transactions till November 2023, the document read.Despite facing global challenges in 2023 like valuation issues, few IPOs, regulatory changes and macroeconomic and geopolitical trends, India remains the third largest tech start-up ecosystem globally, with over 950 tech startups founded last year.The cumulative funding for more than 31,000 tech start ups has exceeded $70 billion (from 2019 to 2023), according to a recent report by Nasscom in collaboration with Zinnov.“In 2023, despite facing global economic and regulatory challenges, Indian tech startups have prioritised the imperative of enhancing their business fundamentals, driving profitability and growth,” said Debjani Ghosh, President, Nasscom.“The proliferation of tech startups in tier 2 and 3 cities marks the ecosystem's resilience,” she added.Navigating 2024, tech startup founders expect to continue the revenue growth path with measured steps focusing on optimising expenditure and maximising profitability for B2B tech startups.Investments in deeptech will continue an upward trend in 2024. With generative AI (GenAI) acceleration, 70 per cent of start-up founders are embedding artificial intelligence (AI) in their solutions.As funding becomes scarce for the Indian startup ecosystem in general, the explosion of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has given a new lease of life to entrepreneurs and founders in the country, as the Centre extends support to the sector.","The state-owned e-commerce platform Open Network for Digital Commerce clocked more than 63 lakh transactions till November 2023.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September.

Space sector start-up Sisir Radar to develop SAR on L/P band SAR,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/space-sector-start-up-sisir-radar-to-develop-sar-on-l/p-band-sar/articleshow/104558111.cms,"CHENNAI: Space sector startup, Sisir Radar Private Ltd has hit success at the prestigious iDEX DefSpace Challenge with its projects for development of “L/P band Continuous Wave SAR (synthetic aperture radar) payload for LEO Small Satellites” and “Unfurlable, Electronically Steering Antenna for L/P band SAR payload” for Indian Air Force (IAF), said a top company official.The company is promoted by former Director at the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) Tapan Misra and the brains behind the Indian space agency’s RISAT series of SAR satellites as well as the Dual Frequency SAR on the Chandrayaan 2 orbiter that is currently circling the moon.""A grant of Rs 3 crore is also there for development of the products,"" Misra told IANS.Synthetic Aperture Radar or SAR is a special kind of imaging radar technology that can provide extremely accurate high resolution imagery of the terrain through clouds, smoke and dust even in pitch dark conditions. SAR imagery provides much higher resolution than other forms of remote sensing technology such as hyperspectral and multispectral. SAR is a critical technology for strategic reconnaissance and planning as well as for disaster management.According to Misra, winning the challenge in just over a year of floating the company is a major booster.He said L and P band SAR have an advantage over other frequencies (like X band) when it comes to penetration capabilities through rain, clouds, foliage and vegetation in a tropical country like India, and underground penetration capabilities in dry terrain.Continuing further, he said the L band SAR will provide 1 metre resolution, spotlight resolution in Stripmap mode. The current industry standard is 5-10 metre in L band. Misra said both the L and P band will operate simultaneously from a satellite borne SAR. Recently, Sisir Radar successfully developed and tested the world’s highest resolution L-Band SAR fitted on a drone. With 0.2 metre resolution, this is by far the highest L band SAR in the world, he said.","Space sector startup, Sisir Radar Private Ltd has hit success at the prestigious iDEX DefSpace Challenge.

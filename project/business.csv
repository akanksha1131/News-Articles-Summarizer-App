Boost for ‘Make in India’! iPhone parts maker looks at supply chain shifts toward India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/boost-for-make-in-india-iphone-parts-maker-looks-at-supply-chain-shifts-toward-india/articleshow/118385699.cms,"Apple has been expanding production beyond China. (AI image)

Murata Manufacturing Co., a producer of iPhone components, is considering relocating some production facilities to India, signalling a shift in global supply chains towards the world's largest population centre.Apple has been expanding production beyond China, recently initiating trial production of AirPods in India. Additionally, numerous Chinese mid-range smartphone manufacturers are anticipated to establish facilities in India, attracted by its substantial workforce and growing consumer expenditure.According to a Bloomberg report, Murata, the Kyoto-based manufacturer of multilayer ceramic capacitors anticipates increased demand in India and is analysing potential investment scenarios in the region, according to company President Norio Nakajima .Nakajima explained that whilst their newest capacitors are primarily manufactured in Japan, clients are requesting increased overseas production, partly for business continuity considerations.Murata's components are essential in virtually all electronic devices, including Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co. mobiles, Nvidia Corp. servers and Sony Group Corp. gaming systems. The firm has also contributed to NASA's Mars helicopter project. Currently, Japan produces nearly 60% of their MLCCs, though this figure is expected to decrease to approximately 50% in coming years, according to 63-year-old Nakajima. Murata leads globally in supplying capacitors, which manage power distribution to electronic components.Responding to customer movements and support from Narendra Modi's administration, Murata has secured a facility in OneHub Chennai Industrial Park in Tamil Nadu, planning to commence capacitor packaging and distribution in the fiscal year beginning April 2026. The company has committed to a ¥1 billion ($6.6 million) five-year lease to evaluate long-term market potential before considering a comprehensive manufacturing facility, according to Nakajima.Infrastructure limitations in India currently prevent Murata from establishing a complete production facility, particularly due to power supply concerns, according to Nakajima. However, the company aims to develop some capacity there to align with their customers' production shifts and respond to growing electronics demand, as well as potential future manufacturing incentives, the Bloomberg report said.Nakajima indicated that whilst India expansion plans are underway, Murata does not intend to set up manufacturing units in the US. This decision stems from their capacitors being primarily incorporated into products assembled in Asia before being shipped to American markets.Although Trump's reciprocal tariffs policy has sparked internal discussions at Murata, their primary worry centres on the broader economic implications. Nakajima expressed concern that widespread consumer goods price increases could adversely affect capacitor orders.Murata anticipates steady annual smartphone shipment growth of up to 3%, driven by emerging markets' preference for low and mid-range devices. Nakajima highlighted that faster growth is expected from AI server demand. This outlook has contributed to a 15% rise in Murata's share value since their February quarterly results announcement.The company, recognised as a key indicator of gadget demand, forecasts global smartphone production to reach 1.18 billion units in fiscal 2024, representing a 3% year-on-year increase.","Murata Manufacturing Co., a producer of iPhone components, is considering relocating some production facilities to India.

'More of white noise': Why Trump’s reciprocal tariffs on India’s exports to US will have a ‘limited’ impact,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/more-of-white-noise-why-trumps-reciprocal-tariffs-on-indias-exports-to-us-will-have-a-limited-impact/articleshow/118382768.cms,"United States remains India's primary export market, comprising 17.7% of total exports in FY24.

India-US Trade Picture

The United States remains India's primary export market, comprising 17.7% of total exports in FY24.

Trade surplus with the US has grown substantially from $7 billion in 2000 to $45.7 billion in 2024.

The tariff relationship between both nations has evolved differently, with U.S. rates on Indian goods showing modest fluctuations.

Statistical data shows U.S. tariffs on Indian products increased from 2.72 per cent in 2018 to 3.91 per cent in 2021, before settling at 3.83 per cent in 2022. Conversely, Indian tariffs on U.S. imports showed a steeper rise from 11.59 per cent in 2018 to 15.30 per cent in 2022. (Check Tariff Rate Tables)

It's interesting to note that principal exports are directed at US markets, imports sourced from China

SBI’s analysis suggests that if the US were to announce a 20% uniform tariff on Indian exports, it would potentially reduce India’s GDP by 50 basis points. SBI is quick to note that this scenario is highly improbable.

India-US $500 billion Trade Plans

India’s Export Diversification A Savior?

US President Donald Trump’s decision to impose reciprocal tariffs on exports from India may have a limited impact, says a recent report. PM Narendra Modi met Donald Trump during his visit to the US last week. The meeting between Modi and Trump took place shortly after the American president declared a fresh reciprocal duty structure to counter elevated tariffs imposed by trading allies.During the tariff policy announcement, Trump highlighted India's position as a leading nation in terms of high duty rates. Previously, he had labelled India as a ""tariff abuser"" and ""tariff king"".So, what will be the impact of US’s reciprocal tariffs on India? Will the damage be extensive on the Indian economy which is already struggling with a slowdown in its GDP growth?A recent State Bank of India (SBI) report suggests that potential US tariff reciprocity would have limited effects on Indian exports, with an estimated decline of only 3 to 3.5 per cent, even with tariffs ranging from 15 to 20 per cent.“Tariff reciprocity may turn out to be more of white noise…Our estimates show overall incremental tariff levels even at 15%-20% imposed by USA would still limit the impact on exports to US only in the range of 3-3.5%,” said SBI in its report.The report also said that this impact would be negated through higher export goals, as India has diversified its exports kitty, pitched value addition, exploring alternate areas and works on new routes that transcend from Europe to USA via the Middle-East, redrawing new supply chain algorithms that foster strategic inclusivity.SBI calculated potential reductions in Indian exports should the US implement a 15% retaliatory tariff (triple the current aggregate) on India. This analysis helps understand how exports respond to tariff changes.India's 2022 tariff rate stands at 3.8% (possibly increasing to approximately 4% during the interim period). SBI’s calculations indicate that an increase to 15% could result in roughly 3% reduction in India's exports to the US, considering anticipated exchange rate depreciation.India and the United States have agreed to increase their bilateral trade to $500 billion by 2030, whilst developing a framework for a trade agreement aimed at reducing tariffs and enhancing market accessibility.Following discussions between PM Modi and Trump, a joint statement outlined their commitment to fostering a trade relationship that ensures equitable growth, safeguards national security and creates employment opportunities.""To this end, the leaders set a bold new goal for bilateral trade – Mission 500 – aiming to more than double total bilateral trade to USD 500 billion by 2030. Recognizing that this level of ambition would require new, fair-trade terms, the leaders announced plans to negotiate the first tranche of a mutually beneficial, multi-sector Bilateral Trade Agreement (BTA) by fall of 2025,"" it said.Whilst the U.S. remains India's primary export market, India is actively working to reduce its market concentration risk, says the SBI report.India is expanding its trade relationships across Europe, the Middle East, and other regions, whilst reinforcing its supply chain infrastructure to maintain export stability.In the chart below, it is evident that India’s total export basket shows India has diversified it across years...India's revised tariff approach demonstrates a calculated trade strategy, balancing international relations whilst safeguarding domestic sectors. The focus has shifted towards value-added exports, moving beyond raw materials to finished products.This enhanced value proposition helps maintain competitiveness in global markets whilst potentially offsetting the effects of increased tariffs.The report notes India's development of efficient trade routes connecting Europe, the Middle East, and the US, reducing transport costs and improving operational efficiency. This supply chain enhancement aims to strengthen India's international trade position.Despite potential US tariff increases, India's strategic trade approach, combined with export diversification and supply chain improvements, suggests continued export growth sustainability, the report says.","United States remains India's primary export market, comprising 17.7% of total exports in FY24.

But then we got hit with COVID, and we had to solve that problem, because I was doing it — and now I said, I want to come back and do the recipri- — because every country in the world almost — we have a deficit with almost every country — not every one, but just about, pretty close.

And — but every country in the world takes advantage of us, and they do it with tariffs. They makes — make it — it’s impossible for him to sell a car, practically, in, as an example, India. I don’t know if that’s true or not, but I think —

MR. MUSK: The tariffs are like 100 percent import duty.

THE PRESIDENT: The tariffs are so high —

MR. MUSK: Yeah.

THE PRESIDENT: — they don’t want to — now, if he built the factory in India, that’s okay, but that’s unfair to us. It’s very unfair.

And I said, “You know what we do?” I told Prime Minister Modi yesterday — he was here. I said, “Here’s what you do. We’re going to do — be very fair with you.” They charge the highest tariffs in the world, just about.

Q 36 percent?

THE PRESIDENT: Oh, much — much higher.

MR. MUSK: It’s 100 percent on — auto imports are 100 percent.

THE PRESIDENT: Yeah, that’s peanuts. So, much higher. And — and others too. I said, “Here’s what we’re going to do: reciprocal. Whatever you charge, I’m charging.” He goes, “No, no, I don’t like that.” “No, no, whatever you charge, I’m going to charge.” I’m doing that with every country.

MR. MUSK: It seems fair.

Tesla’s India Plans

Tesla India entry : Days after PM Narendra Modi met Tesla CEO Elon Musk, US President Donald Trump has said that any potential plans by the EV maker to build a factory in India would be ‘very unfair’. Trump's comments came as part of a conversation with Elon Musk on Sean Hannity's programme.During the interview, the US President, who commenced his second term in January, highlighted his persistent stance on global exploitation of the US through tariffs. He said, ""...every country in the world takes advantage of us, and they do it with tariffs. They makes — make it — it's impossible for him to sell a car, practically, in, as an example, India. I don't know if that's true or not, but I think —""Musk verified this by saying, ""The tariffs are like 100% import duty,"" to which Trump concurred, describing the tariffs as ""so high.""Both Musk and US President Donald Trump have in the past expressed concerns about India's steep import duties on automobiles.A White House fact sheet indicates that India levies a 100% tariff on US motorcycles, whilst the US imposes merely 2.4% on Indian motorcycles.Trump further elaborated, ""Now, if he built the factory in India, that's okay, but that's unfair to us.

Following a recent meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Elon Musk in the US, Tesla has begun advertising retail positions in Mumbai Sources told TOI that the initial phase will involve importing vehicles for sale through retail outlets in Mumbai and Delhi.This development appears to signal a serious intent from Tesla to establish operations in India, following years of tentative discussions.

Previously, Tesla had recruited some staff in India but had to terminate their employment when plans were suspended.Tesla, which has been evaluating Indian market opportunities for several years, is anticipated to utilise the EV policy with planned investments between $2 and $3 billion. The company previously indicated its intention to produce an affordable EV in India, targeting a price range of Rs 25-30 lakh, with plans for regional exports. The government views Tesla's proposals favourably, particularly following Apple's successful iPhone manufacturing and export operations in India.Last year's introduction of a new scheme to attract EV manufacturing investments was widely viewed as specifically targeting Tesla. The initiative offered reduced import duties of 15% for electric vehicles if manufacturers invested a minimum of $500 million and commenced production within three years. Companies could import up to 8,000 vehicles annually at this reduced rate.The recent Union Budget's decision to reduce import duty from 100% to 70% on vehicles priced above $40,000 (approximately Rs 35 lakh) may have further influenced Tesla's strategy.Although the basic customs duty decreased by 30%, the replacement of the 10% Social Welfare Surcharge with a 40% Agriculture Infrastructure and Development Cess (AIDC) maintained the overall tax burden.","US President Donald Trump has said that any potential plans by the EV maker to build a factory in India would be ‘very unfair’ Trump's comments came as part of a conversation with Elon Musk on Sean Hannity's programme.

New Income Tax Bill 2025 : Representing a historic milestone in India’s tax landscape, Hon. Finance Minister – Madam Nirmala Sitharaman has presented the Income Tax Bill, 2025 (Bill) in the Parliament on 13 February 2025.The current Income tax law - Income Tax Act, 1961 (the current Act) was enacted more than six decades ago. With passage of time there were multiple amendments made to the law. Many believed this resulted in the current Act becoming difficult to read, complex to interpret and resulted in unwarranted litigation as well. Hence, it was indeed an opportune time to embark on an exercise to simplify the same. While an attempt was made to this effect a decade ago with the draft Direct Tax Code (DTC) – it never became legislation.Globally as well, countries like the UK, Australia etc., had undertaken similar exercises to enhance clarity and compliance in their taxation laws. Hence, a new simplified income tax law in India was definitely the need of the hour.Also Read | ITR filing with latest income tax slabs post Budget 2025: Will taxpayers with income below Rs 12 lakh have to file tax return? The Bill is prepared by investing more than 60,000 man-hours and has 23 chapters and 2.6 lakh words in comparison to 46 chapters and 5.12 lakh words respectively when compared with the Current Act. The number of Sections has also dramatically reduced from 800 plus sections to 536 Sections only.Secondly the language used in the Bill at many places is extremely lucid and is reader friendly as it has tables and formulas as against the traditional verbose style.One of the most significant aspects of the Bill is the elimination of the concepts of ‘previous year’ and ‘assessment year’. India is trying to join the league of comparable tax jurisdictions by using one single term ‘tax year’. The current terms of previous year and assessment year was apparently leading to mistakes by taxpayers while filing forms/ challans etc. With now only one term “tax year” it will hopefully avoid confusion.Largely, there are no changes to the definition of residency or even salary related provisions for that matter. In fact the choice of the two tax regimes continues to be available to individual taxpayers. There is no change to the tax rates and capital gains tax regime also remains the same.Also Read | New Income Tax Bill 2025 explained: Top 30 FAQs every taxpayer should check TDS and TCS provisions have been made easier to comprehend by providing tables instead of the existing provisions which have lengthy texts that are open to interpretation issues and quite often difficult to understand. The Bill now also gives the ability for individuals to apply for a Lower or NIL rate of TCS while they purchase a car, pay for foreign tour, or make remittance abroad under the Liberalised Remittance Scheme (LRS) of the Reserve Bank of India.It is also interesting to note that elaborate provisions have been enunciated for dealing with transition from the current Act to the new law.There is a clear focus on encouragement of compliance with the mantra of “Trust first, scrutinize later” – as stated by Hon. FM in her recent Feb 2025 Budget speech.As and when the Bill is enacted, the administrative measures for implementing them will be made operational (e.g., publishing of rules, IT infrastructure revamp etc.), keeping in mind the convenience of taxpayers and all stakeholders. For the common man, it is anticipated that the Bill will help in easy understanding of law and smoother tax compliances.","The current Income tax law - Income Tax Act, 1961 (the current Act) was enacted more than six decades ago.

The committee, which includes top industry experts, is expected to submit its report in three months.Based on recommendations of the Khara committee, Irdai will propose changes to the Union finance ministry, after which the department of financial services will issue a new draft bill for stakeholder feedback.The committee includes Dinesh Khara, former SBI chairman; N Kannan, former CEO of ICICI Pru Life; Saurabh Sinha, former ED at RBI; Girish Radhakrishnan, former CMD of UIIC; Alok Mishra, MD and CEO of MFIN; Rakesh Joshi, former WTM at IRDAI; and legal expert L Vishwanathan.Industry sources said the formation of the committee suggests that insurance reforms may take longer than expected. The regulator appears to be laying the groundwork to facilitate the proposed changes in insurance laws announced by finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman.In the Budget, Sitharaman said govt would amend the Insurance Act to allow 100% foreign direct investment in the sector. She also said safeguards would be implemented to ensure that revenue from insurance sales remains within India.At a post-budget press conference in Mumbai, financial services secretary M Nagaraju said that apart from permitting 100% FDI, govt would also allow composite insurance companies to operate.

This will allow the company to import 8,000 cars annually at a highly-subsided 15% customs duty (against 110% now), only after it commits to invest Rs 4,150 crore (little less than) $500 million for a local factory, with additional domestic value addition (DVA) mandates.""There is excitement and nervousness in investment departments of key states as they scurry to attract the Tesla investments. The plan is to approach the company management as soon as possible and begin negotiations, including giving out any special benefits,"" a source said.Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra are already key automobile manufacturing hubs, and so is Gujarat where many companies have invested over the past decade. All three have an edge as they provide easier access to the port, seen as a must for Tesla's India factory, which will also be an export hub .In its initial plan to govt, the company had said that it plans to set up a 5 lakh capacity plant where it would invest between $2 billion and $3 billion. The company plans to make an all-new budget car for India, which is likely to be offered at Rs 20-25 lakh.The prospects of a mega investment from a high-technology company is a big attraction for various govts. ""Some of the states are already in discussions with the company's management, having initiated the talks last year, when the company looked close to entering India. The talks will now happen at a more advanced level as things have progressed much ahead from the previous levels. There is also an effort to understand demands of the company management, including issues around rail connectivity to the port,"" another source said.Asked about the govt's demand to not to import from China, one source said Tesla ""appears to be in sync"" with the request, considering the Indo-China diplomatic issues.

GenNext less focused on building companies: Uday Kotak,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gennext-less-focused-on-building-cos-uday-kotak/articleshow/118399347.cms,"MUMBAI: Veteran banker Uday Kotak has warned that India's economic 'animal spirits' are fading as the next generation of business families focuses more on managing investments than building and running companies.Kotak also called for a cohesive strategy from policymakers to counter the ""vacuum cleaner"" effect of US policies, which are pulling foreign capital away, straining the current account, and affecting the exchange rate and liquidity.Speaking at the group's flagship investor event, Chasing Growth 2025, he said, ""What concerns me is that many in this generation are taking the easy way out, especially in the post-Covid world. They claim to be managing family offices and investments, trading in the stock market, allocating funds to mutual funds, and treating it as a full-time job.""He added, ""If someone has sold a business, they should be thinking about starting, buying, or building another business. Instead, I see many young people saying, 'I'm running my family office.' They should be creating real-world businesses. Why not start from scratch?,"" he said.While acknowledging the importance of startup funding, Kotak questioned why individuals at 35 or 40 were not contributing directly. ""I would love to see this generation be hungry for success and build operational businesses. Even today, I firmly believe that the next generation must work hard and create businesses rather than becoming financial investors too early in life.""Kotak also highlighted the risks of relatively high stock valuations in India. ""Should we continue encouraging retail investors to keep buying? Retail investors in India are funnelling money into equities daily, contributing to domestic institutional flows. Money from individuals from Lucknow to Coimbatore is flowing to Boston and Tokyo,"" he said, noting that foreign companies were taking advantage of high valuations to book profits and repatriate funds.""The US dollar is acting like a vacuum pump, sucking capital out of emerging markets,"" Kotak said, pointing to the impact of a strengthening dollar and rising US Treasury yields above 4.5%, which are drawing capital from global markets. Indian stock valuations remain significantly higher than those in most other global markets.India's external account has three key components: foreign portfolio investment (FPI) at $800 billion, foreign direct investment (FDI), including both listed and unlisted capital, at close to $1 trillion, and $700 billion in external commercial borrowings. This brings the total repatriable capital stock to $2.5 trillion, while forex reserves - net of RBI's forward short positions - stand at $560 billion.India has seen exits from both FPIs and FDI. Companies like Whirlpool and Hyundai are reducing their holdings in Indian arms due to high valuations. In the financial sector, Prudential is looking to sell its stake in Prudential ICICI AMC through an offer for sale.""This $2.5 trillion has the potential to leave. Of course, not all of it will, but could 5% exit? Could $100 billion flow out in a year? We have seen that happen before. In such a scenario, two things could happen - RBI depletes its reserves, or the rupee weakens. I believe we could see a mix of both outcomes.""Kotak stressed the need for a strategic response. ""The decision lies between tightening domestic liquidity or allowing the rupee to depreciate. What should our national strategy be? How should we approach this challenge? Our policymakers - including the finance ministry, RBI, and Sebi - must develop a cohesive strategy to counter this 'vacuum cleaner' effect.""","Uday Kotak: Next generation of business families focuses more on managing investments than building and running companies. Kotak also called for a cohesive strategy from policymakers to counter the ""vacuum cleaner"" effect of US policies.

Automobiles on government's list for trade talks with US,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/automobiles-on-governments-list-for-trade-talks-with-us/articleshow/118399042.cms,"NEW DELHI: Automobiles are among the list of items identified by the commerce department for consultations with other departments and ministries ahead of negotiations for the proposed bilateral trade agreement with the US - an indication that govt is seeking feedback for a possible duty cut for bikes and cars such as Harley Davidson and Tesla.Sources told TOI that the commerce department is looking at the list of sectors where it can offer duty cuts following consultations and auto figures prominently.The discussions are being held at the level of commerce secretary Sunil Barthwal to identify India's offensive interests, meaning areas where it would seek a reduction in import duty from the US, as well as its defensive interests - where it may have to offer concessions.Ministries and departments, in turn, have been told to come back with feedback from industry so that a final view on the sector can be taken in a comprehensive manner.Given Trump's outbursts in recent weeks - as well as the move to impose up to 25% tariffs on auto imports into US - cars and bikes are seen as an area of defensive interest for India, especially as Americans see steel and automobiles among sectors where the world's largest economy should regain its dominant position that it has had to concede to China in recent years.Trump has repeatedly flagged high tariffs in India as a concern, including on Tuesday, and said that companies such as Harley Davidson and Tesla are left with little choice but to set up factories in India.This is despite govt slashing import duty on Harley Davidson and other bikes in the Budget, while lowering the basic customs duty on cars to 70%, although the effective levy, including cess, has been retained at 110%.For Trump, the other area of interest is easier access for American agricultural goods, such as pecan nuts and fruits, despite cornering a dominant share of almonds and pistachios.For India, sectors such as textiles and footwear, as also some of its farm products, will be areas of offensive interest with non-tariff barriers too expected to figure prominently in the discussions as the two sides seek to expand trade from less than $200 billion to $500 billion by 2030.",Automobiles are among the list of items identified by the commerce department for consultations with other departments and ministries.

Top stock market recommendations : According to Aakash K Hindocha, Deputy Vice President - WM Research, Nuvama Professional Clients Group, Axis Bank, Bajaj Finance and JSW Steel are the top buy calls for today. Here’s his view on Nifty, Bank Nifty and the top stock picks for February 20, 2025.Nifty made a fresh 8 month low in opening trade for this week but managed to recover as its 5 year trendline support continues to reel in range of 22650 – 22800. The index ended its 8 day losing streak at the start of this week. This was Nifty’s 6th attempt in a span of 3 weeks wherein it has traded between this support band and attempted to reverse. Bands mentioned above continue to hold on for this week session as well, fresh breakdown of cup and handle pattern on sustaining below 22780 while short covering could pick up only above 23150.Bank Nifty is forming a piercing pattern on weekly charts wherein the weekly candle broke below its previous week's low but reversed to pierce higher within its previous candle’s body signally a strong rejection to trade lower. Bank Nifty as well continues to trade largely in the band of 48800-49800 for the past 7 sessions. Sustained trade on either side is likely to allow for a fresh 1000 pt move.After forming a bullish engulfing weekly candle at the start of the month, AXIS BANK is maintaining its strength. This pattern has emerged near a breakout support, reinforcing the bullish outlook. The stock has retraced around 50% of its two-year uptrend and appears poised to resume its upward trajectory.BAJAJ FINANCE has successfully broken out of and retested a key ascending triangle pattern that has been forming since 2022. The retest has held, and the breakout is gaining momentum, positioning the stock for a potential move higher. This strength could drive the stock up by 6-8%, opening the door for new highs.JSW STEEL is regaining strength after retracing 61.8% of its prior up-move from the 52-week low to high. A strong bullish divergence on the daily chart reinforces confidence, while the stock’s decisive move above its 200-day moving average (placed approximately 4% away from current prices) further supports the optimistic outlook.","According to Aakash K Hindocha, Deputy Vice President - WM Research, Axis Bank, Bajaj Finance and JSW Steel are the top buy calls for today.

Kentucky leaders criticise the decision

KFC’s legacy

KFC , the fast-food giant originally known as Kentucky Fried Chicken, is relocating its corporate headquarters from Louisville, Kentucky, to Plano, Texas, reports BBC news.Parent company Yum! Brands announced the move, which will require around 100 corporate employees and 90 remote workers to relocate in the coming months.The decision is part of Yum! Brands' broader restructuring, aiming to create two main headquarters for its key restaurant chains. KFC and Pizza Hut will now operate from Plano, while Taco Bell and Habit Burger & Grill will remain based in Irvine, California.Texas has become a popular destination for corporate relocations, attracting companies like Tesla, Oracle, and Chevron due to its lack of corporate and personal income taxes. Kentucky, in contrast, imposes a 5% corporate tax, which some analysts believe may have influenced Yum’s decision.“These changes position us for sustainable growth and will help us better serve our customers, employees, franchisees, and shareholders,” said Yum! Brands CEO David Gibbs. He also emphasised that the move would strengthen collaboration and company culture.Kentucky governor Andy Beshear expressed disappointment over the relocation, saying, “I believe the company’s founder would be, too. This company’s name starts with Kentucky, and it has marketed our state’s heritage and culture in the sale of its product.”Louisville mayor Craig Greenberg shared similar sentiments, calling KFC “synonymous with Kentucky.”Despite the headquarters shift, Yum! Brands has pledged to maintain a corporate presence in Louisville. The KFC Foundation, which supports employee education, will remain in the city. Additionally, the company is providing a $1 million endowment to the University of Louisville’s College of Business for scholarships.Yum! Brands also hinted at plans to establish a flagship KFC restaurant in Louisville as a nod to its historic roots.KFC’s origins date back to the 1930s, when Colonel Harland Sanders started selling fried chicken at a service station in Corbin, Kentucky. The brand expanded rapidly, with the first franchise opening in Salt Lake City, Utah, in 1952. By 1991, the company rebranded as KFC to move away from associations with unhealthy fried food.Today, KFC operates more than 30,000 restaurants across 145 countries, with Colonel Sanders’ image still an iconic part of its branding.Yum! Brands, which spun off from PepsiCo in 1997 and later merged with Tricon Global Restaurants in 2002, has seen strong financial performance this year. Shares have risen over 10%, driven by successful earnings from Taco Bell and KFC’s international locations.","KFC and Pizza Hut will now operate from Plano, while Taco Bell and Habit Burger & Grill will remain based in Irvine, California.

"Porsche loses 'premium' tag in China, thanks to 'smarter' tech at budget price",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/porsche-loses-premium-tag-in-china-thanks-to-smarter-tech-at-budget-price/articleshow/118342225.cms,"BERLIN: After decades of dominating China's market for high-performance cars with precision engineering, German automakers are losing out to Chinese rivals that have shifted the definition of a high-end car to one that is electric, smart and affordable.Many new Chinese vehicles resemble their German rivals, including the popular Xiaomi SU7, which mimics Porsche's Taycan. The SU7 rivals the Taycan in power and braking, but also includes integrated artificial intelligence that can, for instance, help with parking and greet drivers with their favorite song. The cherry on top: It sells for roughly half the price of a Taycan. As a result, German automakers that for decades commanded China's premium car market are now seeing their sales dwindle, while Xiaomi - a leading Chinese smartphone manufacturer - last year sold more than 100,000 models of the SU7.Among the hardest hit has been Porsche, which reported last month that its deliveries in China plunged 28% in 2024. Although Porsche's sales were up in every other region around the world, the decline in China was significant enough to pull down its global deliveries for the year by 3%.For years, German automakers relied on the Chinese market to make up for weaker demand elsewhere, leading them to ignore deeper problems at home. Chief among them was a reluctance to adopt technology that has come to define driving in China: electric vehicles equipped with sophisticated software and, increasingly, artificial intelligence.Market experts said advances in software and features such as automated driving and remote control had become standard in Chinese electric cars , pressuring European automakers used to cashing in on their brand names to step up their game. ""I think Chinese consumers right now are ready to accept that Chinese companies can produce cars that are considered as premium to them,"" said an economist.This month, Porsche said it would part ways with its finance chief and a top sales executive, both of whom had come under pressure for poor performance, including in China. Last week, Porsche said it would cut up to 1,900 jobs in Germany over the coming years. The SU7 is not yet available for export, but a few models have reached the US. Ford Motor CEO James D Farley Jr. said he had one shipped to Chicagoand ""didn't want to give it up"".Xiaomi has also been testing pared-down versions of its SU7 Ultra, which will be released in China in March, on Germany's storied racetrack, the Nurburgring. In Oct, the car set a record for the ""fastest four-door sedan,"" and industry media and car fans cheered the news, excited that the SU7 had beaten Porsche's Taycan by 20 seconds. Racetrack officials, however, said the times were not comparable because the Chinese car was a preliminary version competing in an essentially open category, while the Taycan was a showroom-ready model and ran in a highly regulated category. Regardless, the message was unmistakable. nyt","Many new Chinese vehicles resemble their German rivals, including the popular Xiaomi SU7, which mimics Porsche's Taycan. The SU7 rivals the Taycan in power and braking, but also includes integrated artificial intelligence that can, for instance, help with parking and greet drivers with their favorite song.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118342236,imgsize-1359081,width-400,resizemode-4/118342236.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Amid Donald Trump's moves to redefine global trade rules, the resumption of negotiations for India's free trade deals with the UK and the European Union later this month are seen as indications that India as well as its two trading partners are willing to moving ahead with the much-delayed agreements in a bid to overcome the impact of protectionist American policies.Almost a year after negotiations had come to a halt, British minister of state for trade policy Douglas Alexander is scheduled to be in the Capital next week to restart the dialogue after elections in both countries.Towards the month-end, a team from EU will arrive, following signs of a broad agreement on the direction of talks after commerce secretary Sunil Barthwal and commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal held separate talks with their counterparts in Brussels, clearly articulating the need to recognise India's development status and sensitivities. Besides, India wants EU to budget for non-tariff barriers and not just focus the talks on duty cuts.The conclusion of the two deals can help India increase trade with these two crucial trade partners, although the talks with the EU are unlikely to be finalised in a jiffy, given the large membership of the trading bloc as well as the difficult ask in several areas.The eagerness to move is visible on the Indian side too, which has dropped its resistance in some of the crucial areas. For instance, in the Budget, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman agreed to revisit the model bilateral investment treaty , a major demand from the UK and EU.Similarly, by cutting the levy on bourbon whiskey and some varieties of wine as well as bikes over the last fortnight, govt has signalled its willingness to other trade partners that it can lower duties in case it gets something in return. The latest duty cut on bourbon has also resulted in demands from the local industry to ensure that doors also open for Indian goods in overseas markets.""Govt needs to safeguard the interests of Indian liquor manufacturers while deciding on issues related to customs duty cuts (basic customs duty and agriculture cess) and other concessions under FTAs. Though we have already recommended to govt to cut basic customs duty on spirits over a period of 10 years, we also want govt to ensure better international market access, especially the western countries, and safeguard interests of Indian companies against any dumping of products,"" said Anant S Iyer, director general of the Confederation of Indian Alcoholic Beverage Companies, which represents domestic manufacturers.","The resumption of negotiations for India's free trade deals with the UK and the European Union later this month are seen as indications that India is willing to move ahead.

What are reciprocal tariffs?

Are

Indian tariffs

actually high?

How will reciprocal tariffs work?

So, what next?

What's the implication for the US?

US President Donald Trump has vowed to impose what he calls reciprocal tariffs on countries, such as China, Brazil, France, the European Union, India and others, to ""restore the fairness in US trade relationships and countering non-reciprocal trading arrangements"". The ""Fair and Reciprocal Plan"" ostensibly seeks to ""correct long-standing imbalances"" in global trade and ensure fairness across the board and make US industry competitive.There is nothing like reciprocal tariffs in global trade rules. It's a term coined by US president Donald Trump during his election campaign seeking to hit out at trade partners, such as India, which he asserts have high tariffs on products such as automobiles and alcohol. The idea is to match duties. In simple terms, if Country A sees that Country B places a 20% tariff on goods imported from A, then Country A might decide to match that same 20% tariff on goods it imports from B.A White House Fact Sheet says the average applied US tariff is 5%, compared to 39% in India. It also says that India charges 100% duty on motorcycles compared with 2.4% in the US. The numbers do not factor in the lower tariffs announced for motorcycles in the budget - 40% in completely built form. Besides, Trump is also being selective with facts. Some footwear items attract close to 40% import duty in the US, certain varieties of peanuts are taxed at over 54%, while a few textiles products, such as some of men's and boy's trousers, breeches and shorts face tariffs of 28%. And, the import duty on certain types of tobacco is 350%. While the US cries foul over high duties on alcohol in India, which faces upwards of 100% duty, this is because govt treats it as a sin good, just like tobacco.As for complexity, which India is often criticised for, here is a sample from the US tariff schedule: Certain wrist watches have a specific duty, up to $2.3 each, in addition to 6.25% tariff on the case and strap and 5.3% on the battery. In any case, govt officials and trade experts pointed out that India's duties are in line with commitments undertaken by it at the WTO, which provides developing countries the flexibility to levy higher duties to allow nascent industries to develop. In contrast the caps on tariffs for developed countries are much lower.Trump's statement early Friday only suggests a tit-for-tat action, although it is open to interpretation. The US commerce department will produce the list by April 1. It could mean that the U S authorities prepare item-wise import duty based on what each country levies on American products. The White House Fact Sheet talks about Brazil levying 18% duty on ethanol compared with 2.5% by the US. Or EU imposing 10% duty on imported cars against 2.5% in the US. Some experts also suggested that it could mean product category-wise duties. But all of this is speculation since no details have been spelt out.Trump's statements have in fact added more complexities. He wants to budget for subsidies, other trade barriers and VAT. Now, WTO agreement deals with subsidies separately and is subject to safeguard action. As for VAT, global trade rules allow countries to impose the same level of VAT or GST on a product, that is applicable to a domestically produced item. And, it is over and above customs duty.Most trade experts see Trump's threats as a negotiating tool to get countries on the table. Countries are waiting for more clarity to emerge and some are expecting a trade war with American trade partners responding through other action and challenging the decisions at WTO's dispute settlement body. But successive US presidents, starting with Barack Obama, have made the WTO's dispute mechanism defunct and there is not much hope there.Higher tariffs on imports means that prices in the US will go up, something that Trump admits is a possibility in the short-term. But for the medium-term, he is selling the great American resurgence story, ignoring that wages in the US are so high that it is tough for it to compete with countries where they are lower.","US President Donald Trump has vowed to impose what he calls reciprocal tariffs on countries.

Howard Lutnick, Trump’s nominee for commerce secretary, said that his team is working to finalize the details, with tariffs expected to be ready by April 2.

The measure is likely to reshape America's trade relationships and has already sparked reactions from major economies, including India.

Trump’s move follows his campaign promise to crack down on what he sees as unfair trade practices by other countries. He has long accused nations—including allies like India, Japan, and the European Union—of imposing higher tariffs on American products while benefiting from lower US duties.

'Got Trump's Number...': Zelensky's 'Child-Like' Remark On U.S. President's Call Follows Russia Rant

Gone are the days of America being taken advantage of: this plan will put the American worker first, improve our competitiveness in every area of industry, reduce our trade deficit, and bolster our economic and national security. A White House factsheet on Trump's “fair and reciprocal plan” on trade

How would reciprocal tariffs work?

Tariff imbalances: If a country imposes high tariffs on US imports, the US will match those levies on goods from that nation.

Non-tariff barriers: These include government subsidies, stringent regulations that disadvantage foreign companies, VATs, and exchange rate policies that artificially lower the cost of exports.

Sector-Specific Adjustments: Tariffs may apply to individual products, industries, or as an overall rate on imports from a particular country.

For instance, Brazil currently imposes an 18% tariff on US ethanol imports, whereas the US allows Brazilian ethanol in largely duty-free. Under the new policy, Washington could either raise its own tariffs on Brazilian ethanol or pressure Brazil to lower its duties. Similarly, the European Union charges a 10% tariff on vehicle imports compared to the US’s 2.5%, prompting Trump to label the EU’s trade policies as “absolutely brutal.”

Why it matters

The reciprocal tariffs policy is expected to have a widespread impact on global trade, particularly on emerging economies with high tariff rates, such as India. While the intention is to level the playing field, it could also lead to higher inflation in the US and economic slowdowns in affected countries.

For India, which enjoys a trade surplus with the US, the new policy could mean: Higher costs for Indian exporters, particularly in industries like pharmaceuticals, textiles, and information technology, which are heavily reliant on the US market.

Potential retaliatory tariffs from India, leading to a tit-for-tat trade war that could hurt both economies.

Increased pressure on India to lower its trade barriers, which could lead to long-term shifts in economic policy.

Trump’s order also considers non-tariff barriers, such as value-added taxes (VATs), regulatory policies, and currency exchange rates, which could complicate trade negotiations further.

India has been just about the highest tariff nation in the world...hard to sell to India because of very strong tariffs...whatever India charges, we charge them. US President Donald Trump

The big picture

The US-India trade relationship is currently valued at over $190 billion annually, with a $50 billion surplus in India’s favor.

India’s average tariff rate is around 17%, one of the highest among major US trading partners, compared to the US’s 3.3% average rate.

Under the new policy, tariffs could be adjusted country by country and product by product, meaning Indian goods could face increased duties based on existing disparities.

The US government's decision to impose reciprocal tariffs in response to higher duties from its trading partners is unlikely to have a significant impact on India due to differences in their export profiles, according to economic think tank GTRI on Friday.

The Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI) provided an example, stating that if the US imposes a 50 percent reciprocal tariff on Indian pistachios because India does the same, it would have little effect since India does not export pistachios.

Furthermore, GTRI founder Ajay Srivastava noted that for 75 percent of US exports to India, the average tariff remains below 5 percent.

On the other hand, India faces steep US tariffs on many labor-intensive goods such as textiles, garments, and footwear, with rates ranging from 15 to 35 percent on several products, he added.

""Given the differences in the export profiles of the two countries, reciprocal tariffs may not have a significant impact...In the new Trump era, India may wait to see the US decision in April on reciprocal tariffs and then respond in equal measures as we did in June 2019,"" Srivastava said.

The US average applied Most Favored Nation (MFN) tariff on agricultural goods is 5%. But India’s average applied MFN tariff is 39%. India also charges a 100% tariff on US motorcycles, while we only charge a 2.4% tariff on Indian motorcycles. A White House factsheet on Trump's “fair and reciprocal plan” on trade

How it may impact India

1. Indian industries at risk

Pharmaceuticals: India is a leading exporter of generic drugs to the US, and higher tariffs could make Indian medicines less competitive in the American market.

Textiles: The US is one of the largest buyers of Indian textiles and garments. Increased duties could disrupt supply chains and affect Indian manufacturers.

Information technology: India’s IT sector depends on the US for business contracts, and while services are not directly affected by tariffs, trade tensions could spill over into tech policy.

Steel industry: According to a Reuters report, India's smaller steelmakers could be forced out of business by a further surge in imports resulting from sharp tariff increases imposed by Trump, industry executives warned.

""The increased tariffs may divert Chinese and other Asian exports to India while heightening competition, creating a downward pressure on domestic prices, and affecting small Indian producers with low-cost Chinese dumping,"" said Anubhav Kathuria, managing director of stainless steel producer Synergy Steels.

""We need to protect ourselves from other countries diverting steel to India because we do not have any safeguards,"" said one senior steel company executive, who did not wish to be identified because he was not authorised to talk to the media.

2. Trade deficit and tariff battles

Reducing tariffs on Harley-Davidson motorcycles, a longstanding Trump grievance.

Dropping retaliatory tariffs on US almonds, apples, chickpeas, lentils, and walnuts in 2023.

However, these moves may not be enough. Trump’s new policy could force India to make deeper concessions or risk losing access to the US market.

3. Potential retaliation from India

US agricultural products, such as soybeans and corn.

Energy exports, including oil and gas. India is a major buyer of US energy, and trade disputes could disrupt agreements.

Aerospace and defense deals, including purchases of Boeing aircraft and military equipment.

India has historically been cautious about trade wars, preferring to negotiate rather than escalate. However, if Trump's policies disproportionately hurt Indian businesses, pressure could mount on the Modi government to respond.

The leaders welcomed early steps to demonstrate mutual commitment to address bilateral trade barriers. The United States welcomed India’s recent measures to lower tariffs on US products of interest in the areas of bourbon, motorcycles, ICT products and metals, as well as measures to enhance market access for US agricultural products, like alfalfa hay and duck meat, and medical devices. India also expressed appreciation for US measures taken to enhance exports of Indian mangoes and pomegranates to the United States. Both sides also pledged to collaborate to enhance bilateral trade by increasing US exports of industrial goods to India and Indian exports of labor-intensive manufactured products to the United States. The two sides will also work together to increase trade in agricultural goods. India - US joint statement

Between the lines

Trump’s tariff move is as much about domestic politics as it is about trade. By pushing for tougher tariffs, he appeals to American manufacturing and agriculture sectors, which he sees as crucial for his re-election strategy.

India’s global trade strategy could shift as a result. With growing ties to the European Union, Middle East, and Southeast Asia, New Delhi may seek new trade agreements to offset US pressure.

The China factor: Trump’s tariffs have historically focused on China, but expanding them to other countries signals a broader protectionist agenda. India must navigate this carefully, balancing its own trade policies while maintaining strong US ties.

What’s next?

Trump’s tariff strategy could go in several directions:

Negotiation and compromise: India and the US could engage in talks to lower tariffs on both sides, preventing a full-scale trade war.

Gradual escalation: If the US raises duties, India might respond selectively, targeting politically sensitive sectors to push for a better deal.

Broader trade realignment: If tensions persist, India could explore alternative markets to reduce reliance on US trade.

India’s diplomatic approach will be key—whether it chooses to push back, negotiate, or make strategic concessions.

President Donald Trump signed an order on February 13 directing his administration to propose “reciprocal tariffs” on US trading partners, a move that could significantly impact global trade. The tariffs, expected by April, aim to match or offset tariffs and other trade barriers imposed on US goods by foreign nations.In trade terminology, “reciprocal” tariffs typically refer to policies ensuring that countries impose similar levies on each other’s goods, aiming for fairness in trade relations. Historically, reciprocity in trade often meant the mutual reduction of trade barriers to facilitate economic growth and global integration. The US Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act of 1934, for instance, marked a shift away from American protectionism, enabling the US and its trading partners to negotiate lower tariffs on each other’s products.However, the Trump administration sees the current global trade landscape differently. It argues that many US trading partners have maintained policies that disadvantage American businesses, whether through high tariffs, non-tariff barriers, or other regulatory practices. The administration asserts that these policies unfairly benefit foreign exporters while putting American manufacturers at a disadvantage.During Trump’s first term, commerce secretary Wilbur Ross floated the idea of raising US tariffs to match those of its trading partners. Under this “ideal” trade system, the US would lower its tariffs only if other nations did the same. The newly proposed reciprocal tariffs are expected to operate along these lines but with a broader scope, factoring in non-tariff barriers such as value-added taxes (VATs), exchange rate manipulations, and industrial subsidies.Unlike the blanket tariffs Trump previously considered, reciprocal tariffs would be tailored on a country-by-country basis. According to a White House memo distributed to trade officials, the policy will account for several elements beyond simple tariff comparisons. It aims to counterbalance:The impact of Trump’s reciprocal tariffs on India will be determined by how far the US goes in adjusting duties and how India responds.India has a trade surplus of around $50 billion with the US, meaning it exports more to America than it imports. Trump has repeatedly criticized this imbalance, arguing that it reflects unfair trade practices.India has already taken steps to ease tensions, such as:If the US imposes higher duties on Indian goods, India could retaliate with counter-tariffs on American exports. This could affect:(With inputs from agencies)","The measure is likely to reshape America's trade relationships and has already sparked reactions from major economies, including India.

TikTok returns to Apple and Google app stores in US after Trump delays ban,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/tiktok-returns-to-apple-and-google-app-stores-in-us-after-trump-delays-ban/articleshow/118232709.cms,"TikTok is back on Apple and Google app stores in the United States after President Donald Trump delayed enforcing a ban on the short-form video platform for 75 days.The Chinese-owned social media platform was reinstated on Thursday evening, weeks after being removed in compliance with a newly enacted law prohibiting its operation in the country.Trump attempted to delay enforcement of the TikTok ban through an executive order, but companies hesitated to restore the app until they were certain it would not violate the law.The legislation, passed last year, mandated that ByteDance , TikTok's Chinese parent company, divest ownership to a non-Chinese entity by January 19. It also imposed significant financial penalties on app store operators and internet hosting providers that continued to distribute or support TikTok.According to The New York Times, TikTok executives expressed optimism during a briefing call on Tuesday that Apple and Google would soon reinstate the app. H. Lee Justine, a TikTok creator and author who participated in the call, confirmed the statement.""They said that the administration had given them a lot of information that they wouldn't be penalized and that they were really hopeful that any day now they would put it back in the app stores,"" she said in an interview.""It makes me very hopeful that they felt that they could do this because hopefully this means that long term there's not going to be issues and this will work out,"" she added.Despite Apple and Google preventing new TikTok downloads, previously installed versions continued functioning normally on American devices.TikTok's reinstatement on app stores is a promising development, granting the company until early April to secure a buyer. This marks a dramatic turnaround—just a month ago, it faced a ban with strong bipartisan support in Congress. The law had even received unanimous approval from the Supreme Court before being overturned by Trump.","TikTok is back on Apple and Google app stores in the United States after President Donald Trump delayed enforcing a ban on the short-form video platform for 75 days.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume.

Startups will play important role in helping India become 3rd largest economy: CEA Nageswaran,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/startups-will-play-important-role-in-helping-india-become-3rd-largest-economy-cea-nageswaran/articleshow/105332523.cms,"Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor ( CEA ) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran Udaan until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.Udaan built an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business still accounts for a very small part of India’s overall retail market but can balloon to $150 billion in sales and yield a 100% return on capital invested in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co. estimates published in the Mint newspaper.Bengaluru-based Udaan has also ventured into financing through its fintech unit which helps shopkeepers get working capital loans to buy inventory. That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says.

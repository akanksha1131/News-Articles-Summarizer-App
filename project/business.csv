Pumping up production

Chinese electronics component makers are offering price reductions of up to 5% to Indian companies as part of new sourcing contract negotiations, driven by concerns over the US trade conflict. US President Donald Trump has slapped a whopping 125% tariff on Chinese goods after China announced retaliatory tariffs.The US-China trade dispute has considerably reduced new orders to Chinese manufacturers, as global supply networks adjust to reciprocal tariffs, with the US imposing the highest rate of 125% on Chinese goods. The decreased American demand for Chinese electronics will also affect component requirements.The discounts being offered by Chinese companies are a substantial concession in an industry with slim 4-7% profit margins, according to an ET report. This could potentially allow Indian manufacturers to increase their profits by 2-3%, according to television, refrigerator and smartphone producers. Indian companies might transfer some cost benefits to customers to enhance sales.Chinese imports constitute approximately 75% of all electronics components used in Indian manufacturing.""Component manufacturers in China are under pressure,"" said Kamal Nandi, head of the appliance business at Godrej Enterprises Group. ""Prices will be renegotiated as export orders from the US slow down.""The electronics sector typically maintains raw material stocks for two to three months. Companies will initiate new orders from May-June onwards. According to a recent GTRI report, India's electronics component imports in FY24 increased by 36.7% to $34.4 billion compared to the previous year. Over five years, imports grew by 118.2% from $15.8 billion in FY19.Also Read | Apple looks to manufacture more iPhones in India as Trump’s tariffs hit China harder: Report Chinese manufacturers are experiencing surplus issues, according to Avneet Singh Marwah, chief executive of television contract manufacturer Super Plastronics.""There is panic.

""However, since domestic demand in India is not robust, companies may pass some as discounts."" In 2024, electrical and electronic equipment represented the largest segment of US imports from China, amounting to $127.06 billion.Chinese suppliers are encountering reduced demand in India due to production-linked incentives, quality control orders (QCOs) requiring Bureau of Indian Standards approval for overseas sourcing, and increasing import duties on components, which have promoted local manufacturing. The India Cellular and Electronics Association projects domestic components and sub-assembly manufacturing to reach $145-155 billion by 2030, following the government's announcement of the Electronics Component Manufacturing Scheme on Tuesday.

Technology stocks rose after the Trump administration announced a pause in tariffs for phones, computers and consumer electronics, though officials later downplayed the reprieve.Shares of Apple Inc. climbed more than 6% on the Robinhood trading platform. Nasdaq 100 futures jumped more than 2.3% in early Asian trading hours Monday before halving the advance.In Taiwan, iPhone assembler Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. gained as much as 7.1%. South Korean parts maker LG Innotek Co. , which gets the bulk of its revenue from Apple, surged as much as 8.9%. Nvidia Corp. supplier Advantest Corp. rose 6.3% in Tokyo.

US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick insisted it was only a pause, though the new tech levies will almost certainly be lower than the 125% rate on China. Chip tariffs are “coming in probably a month or two,” Lutnick added.“I think it is ‘net’ reprieve, as the bet that electronics will still be less than the 125% reciprocal on China and that companies get to build buffer now,” said Vishnu Varathan, head of economics and strategy at Mizuho Bank. The biggest beneficiary in Asia around this news will likely be China “temporarily, but I would not take too much solace in that as the guns are still trained on China.”Key Chinese stocks to watch include Luxshare Precision Industry Co. and Lens Technology Co., which get more than half of their sales from Apple.

State-run gas utility GAIL has invited expressions of interest for acquiring upto 26% stake in a US LNG (liquefied natural gas) project and a 15-year gas sourcing contract.The move comes within two months of talks between prime minister Narendra Modi and US president Donald trump in Washington, where both agreed to expand energy ties. India offered to increase its purchase of US oil and gas from $15 billion in 2024 to $25 billion in the coming years, contributing towards reducing the $45.7 billion trade surplus.India meets 85% of its oil requirement and 50% of gas needs through imports. The US is India’s fifth largest oil supplier of oil and second largest source of gas. Increased US energy imports fits well with the strategic interests of both sides, particularly New Delhi’s bid to diversify its energy souring, and boost efforts to double the bilateral trade to $500 billion over the next five years.Aligned with this roadmap, GAIL is looking to take equity in new or operational projects with capacities ranging between 5-10 million tonnes per annum or more and a long-term contract for sourcing one million tonne of LNG annually.The Trump administration cleared the way for such deals by lifting a ban on export permits of new LNG projects imposed by predecessor Joe Biden.GAIL is no stranger to the American shale industry as it had acquired stakes in US projects during the peak of shale boom. It was also the first Indian company to have signed pioneering long-term gas supply contracts in 2013 when nobody thought of the US as an option.The latest acquisition move comes amid the company’s bid to sell its entire 20% stake in the Eagle Ford shale project in Texas, because of no profit due to low gas prices.GAIL had acquired the stake in 2011 from Carrizo Oil & Gas Inc.",State-run gas utility GAIL has invited expressions of interest for acquiring upto 26% stake in a US LNG (liquefied natural gas) project.

From India to Dominica

How Choksi got Belgian residency

Next stop: Extradition to India?

In no case can the surrender be made unless the crime shall be punishable according to the laws in force in both countries with regard to extradition. India-Belgium treaty

NEW DELHI: Absconding diamond trader Mehul Choksi was arrested in Belgium on a request by India seeking his extradition in connection with the Rs 13,000 crore Punjab National Bank (PNB) loan fraud case.He was reportedly arrested on Saturday from a hospital in Belgium.After the Interpol Red Notice against Choksi was removed, Indian authorities — including the Enforcement Directorate (ED) and the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) — renewed efforts to extradite him from Belgium.The Belgian government had confirmed the presence of Choksi on its soil, stating that it is giving the matter ""great importance and attention"". This was after he had disappeared from Antigua last year.Choksi, along with his nephew Nirav Modi , their associates, and several bank officials, was booked by the ED and CBI in 2018 for allegedly orchestrating a massive loan fraud at PNB’s Brady House branch in Mumbai.According to the ED, Choksi, through his firm Gitanjali Gems and others, cheated the bank in collusion with certain officials by fraudulently obtaining Letters of Undertaking (LoUs) and enhancing Foreign Letters of Credit (FLCs) without following proper procedures — causing significant financial losses to the bank.So far, the ED has filed three charge sheets against Choksi, while the CBI has also submitted similar charges in the case.Choksi is believed to owe more than Rs 6,000 crore to 34 Indian banks. He allegedly secured the loans using fraudulent methods similar to those employed by his nephew, Nirav Modi. Following the exposure of the scam in January 2018, Choksi fled to the Caribbean nation of Antigua and Barbuda, where he acquired citizenship.In February 2018, the CBI initiated efforts to trace Choksi. A formal extradition request was sent through diplomatic channels to the Antiguan authorities in August that year after Choksi's presence was confirmed.Choksi challenged the extradition bid, claiming he was the target of a political conspiracy. He also raised concerns about prison conditions in India, along with his personal health and safety. Nonetheless, the Interpol’s Commission for Control of Files (CCF) rejected these arguments and approved the Red Notice.In May, 2021 he was detained again in Dominica for illegal entry. A CBI team traveled to the island nation to bring him back to India, but the effort fell through. In July 2021, the Dominica high court allowed him to return to Antigua for medical treatment.Later, on his second plea, the Interpol Red Notice was removed.In a related action, the Enforcement Directorate in February 2021 attached assets worth Rs 14.45 crore belonging to Choksi and his firm Gitanjali Group. These included a flat in Mumbai’s Goregaon, luxury watches, gold and platinum jewellery, precious stones, and a Mercedes-Benz car. The ED had earlier attached assets worth over Rs 2,550 crore in the same case.The diamond merchant's presence in in Antwerp, Belgium was confirmed last month. He was residing in Belgium, along with his wife, Preeti Choksi, after obtaining a residency card in the country, according to a report by the Associated Times. Indian authorities later requested Belgium to initiate his extradition.His wife Preeti is said to be a Belgian national.Citing unnamed sources, the report claimed Choksi submitted “false declarations” and “forged documents” while applying for residency in Belgium, failing to disclose his Indian and Antiguan citizenships.It also suggested that Choksi is planning to relocate to Switzerland, citing the need for treatment at a cancer hospital.India and Belgium have a longstanding extradition treaty that enables the transfer of fugitives accused of serious crimes such as murder, rape, manslaughter, bigamy, forgery, counterfeiting, embezzlement, and fraud.However, the treaty includes key conditions. Extradition can only be granted if the alleged offence is considered a crime under the laws of both countries. Additionally, neither country is obligated to extradite its own nationals, whether by birth or naturalisation, under any circumstances, the agreement states.""Provided that the surrender shall be, made only when, in the case of a person accused, the Commission of the crime shall, be, so established as that the laws of the country where the fugitive or person accused shall be found would justify his apprehension and commitment for trial if the crime had been there committed, and in the case of a person alleged to have been convicted, on, such evidence as, according to the laws of the country where he is found, would prove that he had been convicted,"" the treaty reads.""In no case can the surrender be made unless the crime shall be punishable according to the laws in force in both countries with regard to extradition,"" it says.","Mehul Choksi was arrested in Belgium on a request by India seeking his extradition in connection with the Rs 13,000 crore Punjab National Bank (PNB) loan fraud case. He was reportedly arrested on Saturday from a hospital in Belgium. Indian authorities — including the Enforcement Directorate (ED) and the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) — renewed efforts to extradite him from Belgium.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120269166,imgsize-874948,width-400,resizemode-4/120269166.jpg"

Top 100 listed companies in India have a large amount of free cash flows. Legislation to divert a portion of profits for deeptech investments or acquisitions will catalyse the ecosystem. Vinod Shankar, Founding Partner, Java Capital

Larger public companies in India have rarely acquired Indian companies for IP or product. Much of the scaling up of Indian enterprises has happened through the reinvention of business models or putting a lot of capital to task. Arpit Agarwal, Partner, Blume Ventures

People gravitate to AI, but the country needs way more work in Industry 4.0 to be able to create crores of jobs that our population needs in the coming years. Kaushik Mudda, Cofounder, Ethereal Machines

BENGALURU: At Startup Mahakumbh this month, commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal urged Indian entrepreneurs to pivot from “being the back office of the world to becoming a global technology and innovation powerhouse.” He added that India would make a “substantial allocation” towards deeptech through the govt’s Rs 10,000 crore fund of funds.It’s a timely boost. India’s deeptech ecosystem — comprising startups in artificial intelligence, spacetech, advanced manufacturing, and semiconductor design — added over 480 new ventures in 2023, up two times the previous year. The cumulative base now stands close to 4,000.In 2024, the sector experienced a remarkable surge in funding, with investments rising by 78% compared to the previous year. The sector’s expansion was fueled by supportive govt policies, rapid advancements in generative AI and breakthrough innovations from emerging companies, as per a report just released by Nasscom and Zinnov The report says the top 10 deeptech startup funding rounds in 2024 accounted for about $600 million of the total deeptech funding, which stood at $1.6 billion. Of these top 10, all but one were AI-powered software platforms solving for different use cases.These deeptech startups not only attracted more funding but also commanded higher investor confidence, with median ticket sizes matching or surpassing those of traditional tech startups.Yet, founders and investors warn that India risks squandering this momentum unless the ecosystem matures beyond early-stage support and builds robust demand, capital continuity, and meaningful exit pathways.“The best way to ensure Rs 10,000 crore reaches the right builders is to ally with the right venture capital funds who have a good track record,” said Kaushik Mudda, cofounder of Ethereal Machines, a Bengaluru-based startup that builds CNC machines critical to precision manufacturing. “Most funds or venture capitalists either try to rely on market reports and studies or western models that have worked to make investment decisions instead of spending time understanding underlying technologies.”Mudda sees the govt’s current push as a “real policy pivot,” one that signals long-term national ambition. But deeptech startups face a fundamental challenge — revenue often comes after years of R&D, and capital needs are front-loaded. “We’ve managed by being extremely frugal,” Mudda said. “Now I see a lot more startups having the benefit of raising larger rounds in deeptech, I hope that the funds are then used wisely before revenue kicks in.”Some founders argue that the bigger bottleneck lies in the lack of domestic market depth. Saurabh Chandra , founder of Ati Motors, a startup building autonomous industrial vehicles, said the lack of a domestic market also increases the capital requirements for a startup since global markets are the only viable option. ""This is the route we have also taken,” he said.India’s market reality forces deeptech startups to behave like Israeli ventures — building for the world from Day One — rather than following the domestic scale-first playbook common in China or the US. “The only way the domestic market for deeptech will open up is by increasing competition at the top,” Chandra said. “Few large companies dominate, and technology is not an edge that is required for them to win.”That structural imbalance also explains the tepid M&A environment. Chandra said if the domestic deeptech acquisition engine opened up, it would lead to capital chasing this space. “We have it backwards today by blaming lack of capital,” he said.Arpit Agarwal, partner in early-stage backer Blume Ventures, also noted that larger public companies in India have rarely acquired Indian companies for IP or product. “Much of the scaling up of Indian enterprises has happened through the reinvention of business models or putting a lot of capital to task,"" he said, and expressed optimism that over time, management and shareholders will be able to see more value in deeptech. Vinod Shankar , founding partner at Java Capital, also sees potential for India Inc to plug the gap — if nudged. “Top 100 listed companies in India have a large amount of free cash flows,” he said. “Legislation to divert a portion of profits for deeptech investments or acquisitions will catalyse the ecosystem.”He also pointed out that while India has a robust research pipeline, it lacks scale-stage funding. “India lacks capital at Series B and above in deeptech startups,” Shankar noted. “The capital needs to spread across incubators, early stage and potentially secondary funds, which can create liquidity for early investors to continue the virtuous cycle in deeptech.”To bridge the global demand gap, he suggests leveraging India’s overseas presence. “Deeptech startups’ products are typically global in nature. Demand side for deeptech companies in India is weak. I would suggest setting up trade offices in developed markets for deeptech startups to ensure the demand gap is bridged,” he said.While many founders continue to straddle both domestic and international markets, the latter remains more commercially viable. “We’re split evenly between local and foreign markets,” said Mudda. “We build CNC machines which are the bulwark of advanced manufacturing capabilities of any country. The technology is extremely critical to the mission of Aatmanirbhar Bharat and foreign players don’t have an incentive enough to build out in India.”India’s deeptech ambitions are no longer in question — the challenge now is whether the ecosystem can build the structures that sustain them.","India’s deeptech ecosystem added over 480 new ventures in 2023, up two times the previous year.

HDFC Bank trims savings account rates to 2.75%,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/hdfc-bank-trims-savings-account-rates-to-2-75/articleshow/120265324.cms,"MUMBAI: HDFC Bank , India's largest private sector lender, has cut interest rates on savings accounts by 25 basis points to 2.75% to bring down its cost of funds and protect margins following the 25 basis point cut in the repo rate by RBI. For balances above Rs 50 lakh, the rate now stands at 3.25%, down from 3.5%. The move, while modest, signals a wider recalibration in deposit strategies across the banking sector.For nearly 14 years, HDFC Bank has not raised its savings rate, even as it periodically trimmed it from a peak of 4% in 2011 to the current level. The latest cut reflects a broader shift in depositor behaviour where customers treat savings accounts more as conduits for transactions than as a savings vehicle. Surplus funds are increasingly parked in fixed deposits, where returns are higher. This behavioural change has reduced the proportion of low-cost current and savings account (CASA) deposits in the banking sectors funding mix.The last sector-wide cut in savings rates came during the pandemic, when excess liquidity flooded the banking system. In April 2020, State Bank of India dropped its savings rate to 2.75% and trimmed it further to 2.7% in 2022.Banks typically resist adjusting savings rates through the interest-rate cycle, as the cost of these deposits remains below that of term deposits, despite their instant liquidity. According to HDFC Bank's investor presentation, the bank holds over Rs 6 lakh crore in savings balances. A 25 basis point reduction is expected to save the bank Rs 1,500 crore in annual interest payouts. The cut comes as the financial system transitions from a liquidity deficit to surplus. RBI has committed to maintaining liquidity at 1% of net demand and time liabilities, or roughly Rs 2.25 lakh crore.Earlier, HDFC Bank had reduced fixed deposit rates by 35-40 basis points for select tenures starting April 1 in anticipation of a rate cut. Yes Bank too had lowered its FD rates by 25 basis points. Bandhan Bank cut its savings account rates from 6% to a range of 3-5%, depending on balances. Bajaj Finance also reduced FD rates by 0.25% for longer tenures.Bank of India has withdrawn its 400-day special deposit scheme, which offered 7.3%. The highest rate for a similar tenure is now 6.75%, a 55 basis point reduction.","HDFC Bank has cut interest rates on savings accounts by 25 basis points to 2.75%.

NEW DELHI: The caste census report submitted to the Karnataka Cabinet has recommended increasing reservations for Backward Communities from the existing 32% to 51%, government sources told PTI on Saturday.The recommendation is based on the findings of the socio-economic and educational survey, also known as the caste census, which highlights that Backward Communities make up nearly 70% of the state's population.The report also proposes extending this 51% reservation to educational institutions in Karnataka. It draws comparisons with states like Tamil Nadu and Jharkhand, which currently provide 69% and 77% reservations respectively, in line with their backward class populations.According to the survey, the total population of Other Backward Castes (OBCs) stands at over 4.16 crore out of a surveyed population of approximately 5.98 crore.The report also places the Scheduled Caste population at over 1.09 crore and the Scheduled Tribe population at over 42 lakh.The caste census was initially launched in 2015 under H Kantharaj and was later completed by the Karnataka State Commission for Backward Classes under the leadership of K Jayaprakash Hegde.The final report was submitted to chief minister Siddaramaiah in February 2024.","The recommendation is based on the findings of the socio-economic and educational survey, also known as the caste census.

Marshmallows instead of eggs? Why Jet-Puffed’s Easter decorating kit is gaining buzz amid soaring egg prices,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/marshmallows-instead-of-eggs-why-jet-puffeds-easter-decorating-kit-is-gaining-buzz-amid-soaring-egg-prices/articleshow/120257795.cms,"AI generated image

With egg prices hitting record highs just ahead of Easter, some families — and even a few bunnies — may be looking for more affordable alternatives to keep the holiday tradition alive. One sweet solution? Marshmallows Priced around $2 a bag, marshmallows are emerging as a cost-friendly, dyeable substitute for eggs this season. Capitalizing on the trend, Kraft Heinz-owned Jet-Puffed has launched its first-ever “Dip and Decorate Dozen” kit — a pastel-themed marshmallow decorating set designed to bring Easter fun without the egg-spense, as reported CNN.In a press release, Jet-Puffed described the kit as a “festive, mess-free twist on egg decorating.” Priced at just $1.99, it includes six vibrant color packs, mini tongs for dipping, decorating pens, and a 24-ounce bag of extra-large marshmallows — roughly the same size as jumbo eggs. The kits are available exclusively on Walmart’s website and will be restocked daily ahead of the holiday.Jet-Puffed said the idea came in response to spiking egg prices, which have prompted many households to seek creative and budget-friendly alternatives.“Parents are looking for ways to keep the time-honored tradition alive without breaking the bank,” the company noted.According to the Consumer Price Index, retail egg prices jumped 5.6% last week to a record average of $6.23 per dozen — nearly 60% higher than a year ago. The rise follows an avian flu outbreak that killed about 30 million egg-laying hens this year.However, there may be signs of relief. The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) reports that wholesale egg prices have dropped to around $3 a dozen, as the bird flu outbreak has largely been contained. Still, the USDA cautions that it may take several weeks for those lower prices to reach store shelves.Consumer demand for eggs has also declined, contributing to the dip in wholesale prices. “Demand from egg products manufacturers is mostly light as many have been able to take advantage of a sluggish carton market to build supplies,” the USDA report stated.",Kraft Heinz-owned Jet-Puffed has launched its first-ever “Dip and Decorate Dozen’ kit.

"Trump’s tariff may shrink global trade by 3%, shift exports to India, Brazil: UN expert",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/trumps-tariff-may-shrink-global-trade-by-3-shift-exports-to-india-brazil-un-expert/articleshow/120233711.cms,"The new US tariff regime could shrink global trade by 3 per cent and significantly shift export flows from traditional markets like the US and China to emerging economies such as India, Canada, and Brazil, according to a top United Nations trade official, as PTI reported.Pamela Coke-Hamilton, Executive Director of the International Trade Centre, warned on Friday in Geneva that US President Donald Trump's aggressive tariff hikes—followed by China’s retaliation—are likely to cause long-term disruptions in international commerce and economic integration.“Global trade could shrink by 3 per cent, with significant long-term shifts in trade patterns and economic integration,” Coke-Hamilton told PTI. “Exports from Mexico—which have been highly impacted—are shifting from markets such as the US , China, Europe and even other Latin American countries, with modest gains instead in Canada and Brazil, and to a lesser extent, India.”The White House last week announced steep tariffs on imports, including a 145 per cent levy on Chinese goods. A 90-day pause on ""reciprocal tariffs"" has been granted to most countries, but not to China, which responded by imposing its own 125 per cent tariff on US imports.According to PTI, the ongoing tariff war is causing widespread reorientation of supply chains. Vietnamese exports are being redirected away from the US , Mexico and China, with notable increases to the EU, Korea, and Middle East and North Africa (MENA) regions.ALSO READ | Trump’s tariff rattles US importers; Woldenberg’s CEO calls it 'end of days' Coke-Hamilton cited the apparel sector as a key example. “Textiles is a top industry in terms of economic activity and employment for developing countries,” she said. Bangladesh, the world’s second-largest apparel exporter, would be hit with a 37 per cent reciprocal tariff if US measures proceed, potentially slashing $3.3 billion from its annual US exports by 2029.S he added that for developing nations to withstand such shocks—be it from trade policy shifts, pandemics, or climate disasters—they must prioritise diversification, value addition, and regional integration.“There are opportunities for developing countries not just to navigate times of uncertainty, but to proactively prepare for the long haul,” she said.Early economic modelling, developed with the French economics research institute CEPII, indicates that even before the latest wave of tariffs and China’s countermeasures, global GDP could be reduced by 0.7 per cent by 2040. Countries such as Mexico, China, Thailand, and nations in Southern Africa are among the most affected, along with the United States itself.Meanwhile, the Asia Society Policy Institute (ASPI) in Washington has warned of broader geopolitical implications. Wendy Cutler, ASPI Vice President and Managing Director, said, “With China’s announcement of further tariff hikes against US imports, it’s clear that hopes that China would blink first in this trade war are misplaced. China is in for the long haul.”Cutler noted that while Beijing may have reached the limit of symmetrical tariff retaliation, it likely has “other tools in its arsenal” that could be activated if tensions escalate.“The steep tariffs now in place—145 per cent for Chinese imports into the US and 125 per cent for US imports to China—virtually halt all goods trade between the two largest economies in the world,” she said.ASPI’s Vice President of International Security and Diplomacy, Daniel Russel, said Chinese President Xi Jinping is staying calm amid the crisis, waiting for Trump’s tariff policy to falter under domestic pressure.“He’s betting that Trump’s tariff tantrum will collapse under the weight of the US market response,” Russel said. “By declaring it will ‘ignore’ future US tariff hikes, Beijing is not trying to win the trade war—it’s trying to outlast it and outmanoeuvre Trump.”Russel added that China is pursuing a longer-term strategic advantage by shoring up ties with Southeast Asia, expanding its diplomatic clout, and subtly pressuring US allies. “Xi’s Southeast Asia tour is part of a strategy to reinforce economic partnerships while Washington lashes out and alienates its partners,” he said.","US President Donald Trump's aggressive tariff hikes are likely to cause long- term disruptions in international commerce and economic integration.

China responded by imposing its own 125 per cent tariff on US imports.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120233806,imgsize-669267,width-400,resizemode-4/120233806.jpg"
Trump’s tariff rattles US importers; Woldenberg’s CEO calls it 'end of days',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/trumps-tariff-rattles-us-importers-woldenbergs-ceo-calls-it-end-of-days/articleshow/120232687.cms,"Photo- AP

US businesses that rely heavily on Chinese manufacturing are reeling after former President Donald Trump imposed sweeping new tariffs on imports from China — raising them to an unprecedented 145% in retaliation for what he called unfair trade practices.As reported by the Associated Press, the dramatic tariff hikes — rolled out unpredictably and at speed — have stunned American importers. Rick Woldenberg, CEO of Learning Resources, a Chicago-area educational toy company, said he planned for a 40% tariff hike but was blindsided when the rate jumped more than threefold.Woldenberg’s company, which has made products in China for four decades, now faces an estimated $100 million tariff bill for 2025, up from $2.3 million last year. “Honest to God, no exaggeration: It feels like the end of days,” he told AP.Trump’s tariff escalation follows years of rising tensions between the US and China and is part of his push to bring manufacturing back to American soil. However, industry leaders argue that US infrastructure and labour markets are not equipped to replace China’s manufacturing capacity overnight.According to AP, China still dominates key consumer sectors — supplying 97% of America’s imported baby carriages, 96% of umbrellas, 95% of fireworks, and 90% of combs.Businesses that built their supply chains around Chinese factories now face an uncertain future. “American consumers created China,” said Joe Jurken of the ABC Group, which helps US firms manage Asian supply chains. “They got addicted to cheap pricing.”The tariffs are already having ripple effects:MGA Entertainment, maker of L.O.L. and Bratz dolls, says the price of some toys could double by the holiday season. CEO Isaac Larian told AP the tariffs are forcing the company to cut orders and reduce Chinese sourcing from 65% to 40%.The Edge Desk, a furniture startup, has scrapped production plans in China due to the tariffs and is now looking at Germany and Italy for manufacturing, despite higher costs.Even US -based brands like Little Tikes are affected because they depend on components sourced from China, highlighting how deeply integrated global supply chains have become.Trump has also signaled that other manufacturing hubs like India, Vietnam, and Cambodia could face similar tariffs after a 90-day grace period, further shaking global business confidence.The Associated Press noted that the White House initially said tariffs on Chinese goods would be 125%, before correcting the figure to 145% — including a previously announced 20% levy aimed at pressuring China over the fentanyl crisis.China responded by slapping its own 125% tariffs on US goods, effective Saturday.The unpredictability of the policy rollout is as damaging as the tariffs themselves, business owners say. “There is so much uncertainty,” Larian told AP. “And no business can run on uncertainty.”The economic toll could be significant. The Yale Budget Lab estimates that Trump’s tariffs could reduce US GDP growth by 1.1 percentage points in 2025. Inflation expectations are also climbing — the University of Michigan’s latest survey shows consumers now expect long-term inflation of 4.4%.For Woldenberg, the impact is both financial and existential. His company’s 10,000 molds, installed in Chinese factories over decades, are not easily relocated. “It’s not like you just bring in a canvas bag, zip it up and walk out,” he said.“There is no idle US manufacturing hub, full of skilled engineers, waiting to pick up this work,” Woldenberg told AP. “In an instant, snap of a finger, they’re kaput.”","US businesses that rely heavily on Chinese manufacturing are reeling after former President Donald Trump imposed sweeping new tariffs on imports from China.

"India, 62 nations back global carbon tax on shipping at UN maritime meet",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/india-62-nations-back-global-carbon-tax-on-shipping-at-un-maritime-meet/articleshow/120231825.cms,"Photo - AP

India joined 62 other nations in voting in favour of the world’s first-ever global carbon tax on the shipping industry, a landmark decision adopted by the United Nations’ shipping agency in London on Friday, PTI reported.The measure, passed after a week of intense negotiations at the International Maritime Organisation (IMO), aims to cut greenhouse gas emissions from ships and accelerate the transition to cleaner maritime technologies. The tax is set to take effect from 2028 and marks the first time a global carbon pricing mechanism has been imposed on an entire industry.Under the new framework, ships will either have to switch to low-emission fuels or pay a fee based on the level of pollution they produce. According to estimates, the tax could generate up to USD 40 billion by 2030.While hailed as a significant step forward for global climate policy, the agreement has also drawn criticism for failing to address the climate finance needs of developing and vulnerable nations. All funds raised will be used exclusively for decarbonising the shipping sector and will not be allocated to broader climate adaptation or loss and damage efforts.The pricing mechanism is expected to reduce shipping emissions by just 10% by 2030 — well below the IMO’s own target of at least 20%, PTI noted.India, along with China, Brazil and 60 other nations, voted in favour of the deal. However, several oil-rich nations, including Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Russia, and Venezuela, opposed the move. Notably, the United States delegation did not take part in the negotiations and was absent during the final vote.A coalition of over 60 countries — primarily from the Pacific, Caribbean, Africa, and Central America — had advocated for part of the revenue to be directed toward broader climate finance needs. These countries, many of them highly vulnerable to rising sea levels and extreme weather, voiced disappointment with the outcome.Tuvalu, speaking on behalf of the Pacific Island nations, criticised the lack of transparency in the talks and said the framework does not sufficiently incentivise a shift to clean fuels.Vanuatu’s Minister for Climate Change, Ralph Regenvanu, accused fossil fuel-producing countries like Saudi Arabia and the US of obstructing stronger measures that could have aligned shipping with the 1.5°C temperature limit outlined in the Paris Agreement.Under the adopted system, ships will be taxed according to the intensity of their emissions. In 2028, vessels using traditional fuels will pay USD 380 per tonne for the most polluting emissions and USD 100 per tonne for emissions exceeding set thresholds. The tax will be introduced in stages, progressively discouraging the use of fossil fuels, including liquefied natural gas.Though the overarching framework has been agreed upon, technical details — including the final structure for revenue use and distribution — are yet to be finalised. The policy is expected to be formally adopted in October 2025, PTI said.Environmental groups and representatives from smaller nations have pledged to continue advocating for a more equitable and ambitious framework.Laurence Tubiana, CEO of the European Climate Foundation and a key architect of the Paris Agreement, welcomed the IMO’s move as a step in the right direction. “Polluters must pay for the damage they cause to the climate,” she said, but also called the agreement inadequate, noting the absence of a dedicated shipping levy. “This was a missed opportunity,” she added, pointing to growing global support for taxing high-polluting sectors and the ultra-wealthy.","India joined 62 other nations in voting in favour of the world’s first-ever global carbon tax on the shipping industry.

Malaysian furniture exporters scramble to meet US demand before Trump’s 90 day tariff window closes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/malaysian-furniture-exporters-scramble-to-meet-us-demand-before-trumps-90-day-tariff-window-closes/articleshow/120229588.cms,"Photo credit - AP

Furniture manufacturers in southern Malaysia are rushing to fulfil orders for American customers, racing against time as they prepare for a potential tariff hike under former US President Donald Trump’s trade policy.Trump, who has proposed a 24% tariff on all imports from Malaysia, announced this week that most countries would instead receive a 10% rate for a 90-day period. Exporters in Malaysia have interpreted the move as a countdown to maximize shipments before steeper duties take effect, the Associated Press reported.In Muar, a major furniture production hub in Johor state, workers at factories were operating at full tilt Friday. The city is central to Malaysia’s furniture industry, and the United States is its largest export market — accounting for around 60% of total exports, according to AP.At the Corporate Specialist kitchen furniture factory, workers loaded container after container bound for the US“We are working overtime now and trying our best to motivate our workers, because these 3 months will be very busy,” said Chief Financial Officer Peihing Tsai, speaking to the AP.Tsai noted that in the past four days alone, the factory had shipped more than 30 containers — the same volume it typically sends in a month.Trump’s proposed tariffs could raise costs on a wide range of imported goods, including mobile phones, apparel, and furniture. Analysts say the move could mark the end of an era of low-cost consumer products that Americans have benefited from for decades.Tsai expressed concern that if tariffs rise above 10%, US distributors might abandon Malaysian manufacturers. But relocating production to the United States isn’t a viable solution. “The cost is astronomical,” Tsai told AP. “The increased price will have to be borne by our end consumers.”Candice Lim, general manager of furniture producer Natural Signature, suggested Trump’s tariff threats were more a negotiation tactic than a long-term policy shift.“It is unlikely to go on in this way,” she said in an interview with AP. “Otherwise, how can the American people stand it?”The next three months, manufacturers say, could prove crucial in shaping the future of Malaysia’s US -focused furniture trade.",US President Donald Trump has proposed a 24% tariff on all imports from Malaysia.

Foot-and-mouth disease outbreak prompts mass animal culls and border closures in Central Europe,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/foot-and-mouth-disease-outbreak-prompts-mass-animal-culls-and-border-closures-in-central-europe/articleshow/120229179.cms,"Photo credit- AP

Authorities across Central Europe are scrambling to contain an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease that has led to the culling of thousands of animals and prompted border closures between Hungary, Slovakia, and Austria.The outbreak was first detected in early March on a cattle farm in northwestern Hungary. Within weeks, cases were confirmed on three farms in neighboring Slovakia, as reported news agency AP. Additional infections have since been reported on three more farms in both Hungary and Slovakia — marking the first known outbreak of the disease in either country in over 50 years.Sándor Szoboszlai, a local entrepreneur and hunter in the Hungarian town of Levél — where nearly 3,000 cattle were culled — described the chaos the outbreak has caused. ""Everything is completely upside down,"" Szoboszlai told the Associated Press. “We didn’t even think such a thing could happen. Who could count on that? Nobody.”Foot-and-mouth disease is a highly contagious viral illness that primarily affects cloven-hooved animals, including cattle, pigs, goats, sheep, and deer. Though it poses little risk to humans, the disease can spread rapidly via direct contact, contaminated surfaces, or even through the air.In Hungary, disinfection operations are ongoing, with authorities placing chemical-soaked mats at the entrances and exits of affected towns in an attempt to prevent the spread of the virus. However, many of the mats have proven ineffective, drying out quickly or being swept aside by passing vehicles, AP observed.The Slovakian government has responded by closing 16 of its border crossings with Hungary and one with Austria, citing inadequate containment efforts by Hungarian authorities. Austria, which has not reported any infections, closed 23 crossings with Hungary and Slovakia last week.The Czech Republic, while further removed from the outbreak's epicenter, has imposed disinfection protocols at all five major border crossings for freight trucks entering the country.Jiri Cerny, an associate professor at the Czech University of Life Sciences in Prague, told the AP that the disease is most likely to spread through contaminated human objects — including vehicle tires, footwear, and food.Czech Agriculture Minister Marek Výborný stated that border restrictions could be lifted 30 days after the last infected animal is culled in Slovakia.In Hungary, no new infections have been confirmed this week. Agricultural Minister István Nagy told reporters Friday that disinfection efforts at the final infected sites are expected to be completed by Saturday.Earlier in the week, Hungarian official Gergely Gulyás, chief of staff to Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, raised concerns that the outbreak might have been caused by “an artificially produced virus,” suggesting a possible “biological attack.” Gulyás did not provide evidence for the claim, which he said was based on preliminary verbal assessments from a foreign laboratory analyzing samples.The Hungarian government has pledged to support affected farmers with financial aid, including a moratorium on loan payments and compensation for lost livestock.Szoboszlai, the Levél resident, became emotional when discussing the impact on a local farmer whose entire herd was culled. “I feel so sorry for him, because this is his life's work,” he said. “It will be very difficult to start over.""","Foot-and-mouth disease has led to the culling of thousands of animals in Hungary, Slovakia, and Austria.

Investors dumped US government bonds, the dollar tumbled and stocks seesawed Friday, capping a volatile week as President Donald Trump 's unpredictable tariff policy rattled market confidence.Trump triggered a massive market sell-off last week by announcing universal tariffs, and this week he sparked a huge but short-lived rally by pausing higher duties against scores of countries.But he kept China in his crosshairs, hitting Chinese goods with a 145 percent tariff.Beijing said Friday that it would hit back with 125 percent duties on American products, but suggested it would not retaliate further in the future.Wall Street indexes opened in the red Friday but rose shortly thereafter as investors sought to make sense of the latest trade war news, with the broad-based S&P 500 edging up 0.3 percent around midday.European markets also had a roller-coaster trading day, with Frankfurt closing 0.9 percent lower and Paris down 0.3 percent. London rose 0.6 as data showed the UK economy grew far more than expected in February.""The main driver of the renewed market pressure was an increased focus on the US-China escalation,"" said Jim Reid, managing director at Deutsche Bank.""Neither the US nor China are showing signs of backing down, with President Trump expressing confidence in his tariff plans,"" Reid said.The dollar plunged to its lowest level against the euro in more than three years as investors fled what is typically considered a key haven currency, though it later pared some of its losses.In a more worrying sign of cracking investor confidence in the US economy, the yield on the 10-year US Treasury bill rose sharply to 4.5 percent as its price tumbled.John Higgins, chief markets economist at Capital Economics, said it was a sign of ""concern that China might dump its vast holdings of Treasuries"" even if that risked losses for Beijing and driving the yuan higher against the dollar.With Treasuries being sold off, sending their yields higher and making US debt more expensive, there is a fear of a bigger exodus from American assets down the line.JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon on Friday rejected the notion that US Treasuries were no longer a haven.""If you're going to invest your money in something, America is still a pretty, pretty good place in this turbulent world,"" Dimon said in a conference call after his bank reported hefty first-quarter profits and revenue.The weaker dollar and the rush for safety sent gold to a record high above $3,220 an ounce.Oil prices rose slightly after huge falls on Thursday.""There remains considerable uncertainty around the impact of tariffs on economies and company earnings, and that could keep markets volatile for some time,"" said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell.Investors were also turning to more routine economic and business data, with the release of inflation data and corporate earnings.Official figures showed US producer inflation fell sharply last month before the tariffs took effect.JPMorgan Chase reported first-quarter profits of $14.6 billion, up nine percent from the period last year.In Asia, the Tokyo stock market shed three percent -- a day after surging more than nine percent -- while Sydney and Seoul were also in the red.Hong Kong and Shanghai rose as traders focused on possible Chinese stimulus measures.There were gains in Taipei and Ho Chi Minh City stocks as the leaders of Taiwan and Vietnam said they would hold talks with Trump.","Dollar plunges to its lowest level against the euro in more than three years as investors flee what is typically considered a key haven currency.

China-US trade war

Elon Musk-founded Tesla has discontinued accepting fresh orders for its Model S and Model X vehicles via its Chinese website, as reported by Reuters on Friday, amid escalating trade tensions between the world's leading economies.Customers can no longer place orders for these imported models through Tesla's WeChat mini programme account. Both vehicles are manufactured in the United States before being exported to China.The firm offered no explanation for this decision, which coincides with China's implementation of 84% tariffs on US products, following Trump's imposition of 145% duties on Chinese imports.The American automotive manufacturer produces Model 3 and Model Y vehicles at its Shanghai facility, serving both domestic Chinese market and European exports, which constitute the bulk of its sales.According to Li Yanwei, an analyst at the China Auto Dealers Association, China imported 1,553 Model X cars and 311 Model S cars in 2024.This comes amid an escalating trade war between the US and China, which began with President Trump hiking tariffs and China swiftly retaliating.The US, this week, dramatically raised tariffs on Chinese imports to 145% overall, citing unfair trade practices. China quickly retaliated with 84% tariffs on American goods.President Trump pulled back tariffs on other nations, offering a 90-day negotiation window, but held firm on China, declaring other countries are “lining up to negotiate.” In response, China accused the US of bullying and violating global trade norms, vowing to ""fight to the end.""China has stepped up its diplomatic efforts, especially in Europe and Southeast Asia, to build alliances. Premier Li Qiang and Commerce Minister Wang Wentao reached out to EU and ASEAN leaders, though responses have been mixed. Key nations like India, Australia, and even Russia have not joined China’s side.Markets reacted sharply — surging in Asia and Europe due to Trump's partial retreat, while US markets dipped slightly.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021.

Defence Spending Can Fuel Growth, Says CDS Anil Chauhan As India Rethinks Guns Versus Butter Debate

Defence Budget 2026 - 4 Point Approach

FICCI notes that in Budget 2025, the Ministry of Defence was allocated Rs 6,81,210.27 crore for FY 2025–26. This was a 9.53% rise over the Budget Estimates for FY 2024–25. The industry body suggests that while the government maintains the growth of approximately 10% in the overall budgetary support for the Ministry of Defence in the coming year, the share of capital outlay should be increased to 30% from around 26% earlier. “Additional capital outlay will help in modernisation of military infrastructure, particularly for investments in frontline assets, UAVs, counter UAV systems, electronic warfare systems and air defence systems in border areas,” it says.

FICCI is of the view that the budgetary allocation for the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) needs to be stepped up. Last year the budget was increased by 12.4% to Rs 26,816.82 crore in FY 2025–26. “The overall allocation for DRDO should be increased by Rs 10,000 crore in the upcoming budget. This will financially strengthen the DRDO in developing new technologies with special focus on fundamental research for frontier technologies in collaboration with private parties through flagship scheme of DRDO i.e. Technology Development Fund and will assist the development of Deep Technology in the defence sector.”

The industry body notes that under the Atmanirbhar Bharat initiative, the government has made notable progress in defence indigenisation through setting up of Defence Industrial Corridors in the states of Uttar Pradesh and Tamil Nadu. This momentum needs to be strengthened further, says FICCI, advocating for establishing an Eastern India Defence Industrial Corridor. “Synchronising with the ‘Purvodaya Scheme’ , it would rejuvenate the industrial clusters in Eastern India and shall spur job creation, stimulate R&D, and establish India as a global hub for defence exports, while securing national interests across all three borders,” FICCI says.

Budget 2026 should also focus on giving an impetus to defence exports which have risen at a compound annual growth rate of 46% between 2016–17 and 2023–24. This has largely been driven by higher exports from private sector firms. The central government aims to achieve defence exports worth Rs 50,000 crore by 2028-29. FICCI suggests that the government considers setting up a Defence Export Promotion Council (DEPC) that can co-ordinate with armed services, their foreign directorates, DPSUs, private manufacturers, MEA, Indian embassies, and MoD and communicate with foreign governments and buyers.

Budget 2026 for defence: Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman ’s Union Budget 2026 should look to prioritise growth-enhancing productive capital expenditure, with a special focus on the defence sector at a time when the global environment is marked with uncertainty, says FICCI in its pre-Budget memorandum.According to the industry body, India needs to lay special emphasis on technology-driven defence innovation. “India’s external security environment today is marked by heightened uncertainty and rise in disputes and conflicts. India’s adversaries are investing heavily in advanced military technologies such as autonomous weapons, hypersonic systems, UAV swarms, and AI-enabled warfare, posing heightened risks. A strong, modern, and well-resourced defence architecture has thus become critical for safeguarding India’s territorial integrity and preserving strategic autonomy,” FICCI has said in its Budget 2026 wishlist.FICCI has advocated for higher emphasis on ‘Atmanirbharta’ in defence, with modern techniques using artificial intelligence, and not just platform-driven enhancements.“Future warfare will be defined by technology-driven, multi-domain and information-centric operations. Conflicts will increasingly span land, air, sea, cyber, space and electromagnetic spectrum domains. For India, preparing for such challenges requires a shift from platform-centric to networked, integrated, AI-enabled capabilities backed by robust indigenous defence innovation,” it says.According to FICCI, increasing the defence budget should not just be about a budgetary choice but a strategic imperative. So what should the Union Budget 2026 for defence focus on? FICCI advocates a four-pronged approach:","In Budget 2025, the Ministry of Defence was allocated Rs 6,81,210.27 crore for FY 2025–26. FICCI has advocated for higher emphasis on ‘Atmanirbharta’ in defence, with modern techniques.

Budget 2026: Will old income tax regime be discontinued leaving new regime as the only option?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/taxation/budget-2026-income-tax-expectations-will-old-income-tax-regime-be-discontinued-new-regime-made-the-only-option/articleshow/126507077.cms,"Fundamentally, the government wants to move towards an income tax return regime with minimal deductions and exemptions. (AI image)

In a pre-Budget 2026 survey, most tax experts who spoke to Times of India Online said that the government may look to eventually do away with the old income tax regime, though the transition is likely to happen in a phased manner.

New vs Old Regime: The Fundamental Differences

New Regime Tax Slabs

Old Tax Regime Slabs

Why Was The New Income Tax Regime Introduced?

New Tax Regime & Its Growing Popularity

Will The Old Tax Regime Be Phased Out?

New Vs Old Income Tax Regime

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will present the Union Budget 2026 on February 1, 2026 and like every year common man and taxpayers, especially salaried are watching out for possible changes on the income tax front. One big factor when it comes to income tax is the regime under which you choose to file your income tax return.Ever since the new income tax regime was introduced a few years ago, one question that has played in the minds of taxpayers is: will the old income tax regime cease to be an option soon?The new and old income tax regimes differ on one basic fundamental: the former has lower tax rates at higher levels of income compared to the old tax regime and fewer deductions and exemptions.For example; the basic exemption limit under the new tax regime is higher. With the Section 87A rebate, the level of tax free income for salaried taxpayers goes to Rs 12.75 lakh (including standard deduction)! Simply put; an individual earning Rs 1 lakh a month needs to pay ZERO tax!On the other hand, the option to avail deductions and exemptions under the old income tax regime work in its favour, though over the last few years the government has increasingly made the new income tax regime more lucrative.Some of the common income tax exemptions and deductions available under the old income tax regime are: Section 80C benefits (up to Rs 1.5 lakh for popular investments such as Provident Fund, PPF), Section 80D for medical insurance, NPS contributions, House Rent Allowance (HRA), Leave Travel Allowance (LTA), Section 80 TTA (interest on bank deposits etc.), home loan benefits.To get a better understanding of the future of the old income tax regime, let’s understand why the new income tax regime was introduced. Fundamentally, the government wants to move towards an income tax return regime with minimal deductions and exemptions to simplify the filing process and reduce the need for maintaining records and paperwork.In her Budget 2020 speech FM Nirmala Sitharaman had introduced the new income tax regime saying, “Currently the Income Tax Act is riddled with various exemptions and deductions which make compliance by the taxpayer and administration of the Income Tax Act by the tax authorities a burdensome process. It is almost impossible for a taxpayer to comply with the Income-tax law without taking help from professionals. In order to provide significant relief to the individual taxpayers and to simplify the Income-tax law, I propose to bring a new and simplified personal income tax regime wherein income tax rates will be significantly reduced for the individual taxpayers who forgo certain deductions and exemptions. ”As Parizad Sirwalla, Partner and Head, Global Mobility Services, Tax at KPMG in India explains: When the new tax regime was introduced for the first time from FY 2020-21 it was then indicated by the government that there was a long-term intent to phase out the plethora of exemptions/deductions.Over the years, the government has in fact made the new tax regime - which disallows many widely claimed exemptions/ deductions under the old tax regime - increasingly more lucrative for individual taxpayers over the years.Surabhi Marwah, Tax Partner at EY India points out: recent data shows that for Assessment Year 2024‑25, around 72% of filers opted for the new tax regime, indicating broad acceptance of the simplified framework.“Given this trajectory, any move to retire the old regime, if considered, would likely be phased, allowing a cooling‑off period to support a smooth transition for taxpayers,” she tells TOI.The past two Budgets have reinforced the trends of trying to make the new income tax regime more popular, through more favourable new personal tax regime changes, including higher basic exemption and rebate limits in 2025, and increased standard deduction and NPS employer-contribution benefits in 2024.What’s interesting to note is that if 72% of taxpayers had opted for the new income tax regime by FY2025, the number will likely go up for FY 2025-26 after FM Nirmala Sitharaman tweaked tax slabs under the new income tax regime in last year’s Union Budget, and also made income up to Rs 12 lakh tax free.Some experts are of the view that exemptions and deductions are important especially when it comes to encouraging savings and providing home loan related tax benefits. However, a gradual phasing out of the old tax regime, with stagnation is seen.Preeti Sharma, Partner – Tax and Regulatory Services at BDO India told TOI, “The government has clearly shown its preference for the new income tax regime and has made it the default tax regime. However, an immediate abolition of the old tax regime is unlikely.”Why is the old income tax regime still relevant for many? The old tax regime continues to be beneficial for a certain group of taxpayers, particularly those who claim deductions such as House Rent Allowance (HRA), home-loan interest and benefits under Sections 80C and 80D, and especially for salaried taxpayers who claim deductions under Chapter VI-A.“As a result, the government is expected to follow a gradual approach, continuing with both tax regimes while nudging taxpayers towards the new tax regime,” she said.As Parizad Sirwalla of KPMG points out: many of the deductions (allowed under old regime) are basis long term commitment (e.g., renting a house/ buying a house, PPF, Life Insurance premium etc.) and hence complete deletion of old tax regime may have an impact on these long-term savings/ investment/ expenditure by the common man.“Additionally, prior to the New Income Tax Act being published there was expectation that the new Act may be a signal to do away with the old regime – however the final Act that has been passed continues the old tax regime as optional,” she says.Chander Talreja, Partner at Vialto Partners says that the government has given flexibility to the taxpayers to choose the best regime applicable for their case depending upon their personal situation and individual circumstances.“Few may find the old regime beneficial as a lot of deductions and exemptions help them to save tax and also ensure that they don’t hit the income ceiling where the surcharge becomes applicable,” he tells TOI.“Moreover, the government would also factor that there is a huge market for housing loans, various investments etc. which qualify for section 80C benefit and not allowing tax benefits for these may hamper their market demand. Hence, the flexibility to opt between the regimes would continue for some time,” he adds.On the other hand, Tanu Gupta, Partner at Mainstay Tax Advisors LLP finds merit in ending the old income tax regime to avoid confusion.She notes that while the government may not completely eliminate the old tax regime from the law, it is already moving toward making the new regime so attractive that the old regime could automatically become redundant.“Although the old regime still finds a place in the newly enacted Income Tax Act 2025, the changes introduced in last year’s budget—such as tweaking the slabs, raising the Section 87A rebate to Rs 12 lakh, and capping the surcharge at 25% for incomes above Rs 5 crore, while leaving the old regime unchanged—represent a significant step toward making the new tax regime beneficial for most taxpayers,” she told TOI.“For FY 2023–24, 72% of taxpayers opted for the new regime, and this percentage is expected to be significantly higher for FY 2025–26,” she adds.Tanu Gupta is of the view that two income tax regimes cause confusion, beating the purpose of simplification of tax filing. “Evaluating options by comparing the old and new regimes, and for business income taxpayers being allowed to switch only once in a lifetime, only adds to the confusion, contrary to the tax policy objective of simplification,” she says.“There have even been instances where tax officers, while processing returns under Section 143, inadvertently applied the old regime despite the taxpayer choosing the new regime, causing inconvenience and additional administrative burden. Therefore, there is merit in putting a final end to the old tax regime rather than letting it fade naturally by becoming redundant,” she explains.Radhika Viswanathan, Executive Director, Deloitte India sees a gradual stagnation of the old income tax regime. This is evident from the fact that one has to not only explicitly opt for the old income tax regime, it has not seen periodic updates to its slab rates and standard deduction.“The introduction of the Income Tax Act 2025 aims for simplicity. Keeping two parallel systems forever contradicts the goal of simplification. Hence, we may expect the old regime to remain for another 2-3 years to allow long-term investors (with 15-year PPF accounts or longer period home loans) to transition smoothly. However, it is increasingly becoming a legacy option unattractive for most taxpayers,” she tells TOI.Akhil Chandna, Partner and Global People Solutions Leader, Grant Thornton Bharat anticipates a gradual phase-out of the old regime over time.“Recent budget announcements have consistently enhanced the attractiveness of the new regime—through higher rebate limits and inclusion of standard deductions—while leaving the old regime unchanged. Consequently, the old tax regime is expected to become redundant in the coming years,” he says.","Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will present the Union Budget 2026 on February 1, 2026. The new and old income tax regimes differ on one basic fundamental: the former has lower tax rates at higher levels of income compared to the old tax regime.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126507342,imgsize-37050,width-400,resizemode-4/new-vs-old-tax-regime.jpg"

MUMBAI: Housing demand declined by 8.7% quarter-on-quarter during Oct-Dec even as supply rebounded by 3.4% across key cities, hinting at a phase of measured moderation in India's residential real estate market. Residential prices rose by 1.5% QoQ and 16.9% year-on-year during the quarter, the slowest pace of appreciation recorded during the last two years, according to Magicbricks PropIndex.The moderation in demand aligned with festive spending patterns and monetary policy transitions, as homebuyers adopted a wait-and-watch approach amid evolving interest rate expectations. However, housing supply gained momentum during the quarter, led by Greater Noida, Gurugram, Thane and Noida. The revival was concentrated in the mid- and upper-mid segments, as developers increasingly aligned new launches with end-user affordability thresholds.In 2026, market momentum is expected to be influenced by interest rate clarity, infrastructure execution, and continued alignment of new supply with affordability thresholds, Magicbricks said.",Housing demand declined by 8.7% quarter-on-quarter during Oct-Dec.

If Q2 marked the start of demand improvement and Q3 sustained it, what indicators give you confidence that this momentum will carry into 2026?

US Issues Blunt Warning To Indian Students: Breaking Laws May Cost Visas, Careers And Future Dreams

With discretionary spending still selective, are short-cycle and rapid-build AI projects becoming a growth lever?

With TCS headcount down about 31,000 over 2 quarters, should AI-led growth decouple from traditional headcount expansion?

Will TCS recalibrate its campus hiring target of 40,000 given AI-led productivity gains? Some peers are offering Rs 20 lakh entry-level salaries. Will TCS match that?

If fresh H-1B approvals are closer to 1,000, does that imply nearly $100 million in visa fees?

Are investors concerned that a debt-fuelled AI data-centre build-out exposes risks?

Bengaluru: TCS's performance in the December quarter came in below analysts' expectations on both revenue growth and earnings (Ebit) margins. Despite global uncertainty weighing on spending, demand for tech-led transformation remains resilient. In an interview with TOI, CEO K Krithivasan and CHRO Sudeep Kunnumal discussed the demand environment, hiring outlook, and the trajectory of its AI-led revenues. Excerpts:Krithivasan: The total contract value is good despite this being a seasonally weak quarter. On the AI front, a couple of quarters ago, there was a lot of experimentation; today, many real projects are going live in production. Customers are willing to sign new projects based on return on investment and payback periods. This gives us confidence that they are willing to engage, both on cost optimisation and transformation.Krithivasan: This quarter, our AI services revenue moved to $1.8 billion on an annualised basis from $1.5 billion last quarter.The reason we talk about these rapid AI-led projects is that they deliver defined, committed outcomes in a short period. While AI is incremental today, it will become material over time.Sudeep: Our demand for high-quality talent remains strong. We continue to hire while investing heavily in upskilling our existing workforce. We are hiring from campuses, laterals, and leadership roles globally.Sudeep: We don't want to commit to a specific number. Demand is robust, traction is strong, and we are actively hiring from campuses at scale. Over the last 2-3 years, we adopted a tiered salary and talent structure and the share of hires in higher tiers increased significantly.Sudeep: We applied in anticipation, but it is not necessary that we use all those visas. Over many years, we invested in building strong local employer brands. In the current quarter, most requirements were met through local hiring, reducing dependency on H-1Bs. We remain on track with our plan to hire around 15,000 people locally in the US in the next 3 to 5 years.Krithivasan: Our investment thesis is grounded in strong demand in the country. Data centre costs are about 30% lower than in western markets, thus making India attractive for AI training and inference. There is also a growing need for sovereign data centres. With a balanced mix of debt and equity, we do not see material downside risks.","TCS CEO K Krithivasan and CHRO Sudeep Kunnumal discussed the demand environment, hiring outlook, and the trajectory of its AI-led revenues.

Nvidia AI chips in China! US approves sale of H200 chips; commerce dept sets strict limitations,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/nvidia-ai-chips-in-china-us-approves-sale-of-h200-chips-commerce-dept-sets-strict-limitations/articleshow/126515749.cms,"Nvidia has received the green signal to export advanced artificial intelligence chips to China! The US commerce department on Tuesday, signalled a policy shift, approving the tech giant to sell its H200 chips to Beijing, under certain restrictions.The development follows an announcement by US President Donald Trump last month permitting exports of the H200, provided Nvidia can meet conditions, including showing that there is “sufficient” supply within the United States. At the same time, the department highlighted that the company’s most advanced processors will continue to be off-limits to Chinese buyers.The bureau of industry and security (BIS), which oversees export controls, said it has altered its licensing review process for the H200 and comparable chips. Instead of an automatic rejection, applications will now be reviewed on a case-by-case basis.Earlier on December 9, last year, Trump said that he reached an understanding with Chinese President Xi Jinping permitting Nvidia to sell the H200 in China, with the US government set to receive a 25% share of the revenue from those sales.However, even with the regulatory opening, the outlook for demand in China remains uncertain.Reports suggest Beijing has been urging technology firms to rely more heavily on domestically produced chips. According to The Information, Chinese officials have told some companies that approval to buy H200 chips would be granted only in specific situations, such as for university research or development laboratories, sources told AFP.The same outlet had earlier reported that Chinese authorities had asked companies to halt H200 purchases while considering whether to require firms to buy a fixed proportion of AI chips from Nvidia’s Chinese competitors.The policy change marks a clear break from the approach taken under former president Joe Biden, whose administration imposed sweeping restrictions on exports of advanced AI chips over concerns they could be used for Chinese military purposes. Democrats in Congress have since criticised the shift, calling it a serious error that could strengthen China’s military and economic position.Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang has publicly supported allowing sales of some advanced chips to China, arguing that it is important for AI systems worldwide to be built on US technology.The H200 chips are graphics processing units, or GPUs, which are essential for training AI models that underpin the generative AI surge that began with the launch of ChatGPT in 2022. Nvidia dominates the global GPU market and has become the world’s most valuable company amid intense demand and optimism surrounding AI.While the United States and China continue to compete for leadership in artificial intelligence, the H200 remains a step behind Nvidia’s latest offerings. The chips are estimated to be about 18 months behind the company’s most advanced products, which will continue to be off-limits to China.","US commerce department on Tuesday, signalled a policy shift, approving the tech giant to sell its H200 chips to Beijing, under certain restrictions.

Representatives of Venezuela's state oil company PDVSA said Tuesday they had appealed the US-forced sale of its prized Houston-based subsidiary Citgo to pay off creditors.Citgo is in the crosshairs of creditors seeking the settlement of debts in excess of $20 billion that cash-strapped Caracas has been unable or unwilling to pay.In late November, a Delaware court authorized Citgo's sale to settle a long-running legal dispute.Citgo's board requested ""the annulment of the court-ordered sale"" due to ""serious conflicts of interest"" in the US foreclosure process that it said were ""detrimental to the economic value of the asset.""The board estimates Citgo to be worth around $10 billion.Citgo has been under the control of the Venezuelan opposition since 2019, when Washington recognized then opposition leader Juan Guaido as Venezuela's rightful leader.The move aimed to force out authoritarian leader Nicolas Maduro but the 63-year-old socialist remained in power until his capture in a US bombing raid on Caracas on January 3 of this year.Maduro's vice president Delcy Rodriguez, now the country's interim leader, had rejected Citgo being put up for auction last year, referring to it as a ""forced sale.""But since Maduro's capture, she has stressed her willingness to cooperate with US demands for access to Venezuela's vast oil wealth.",Citgo is in the crosshairs of creditors seeking the settlement of debts in excess of $20 billion.

Trump 'DECLARES WAR' On Khamenei, 'INSTIGATES' Iranians To Carry Out Coup | 'VERY BIG PRICE TO PAY'

US President Donald Trump a visited a Ford Motor Co. assembly line in Michigan on Tuesday in an attempt to push his manufacturing agenda, as his administration works to counter voter anxiety over jobs, inflation and the cost of living.Trump walked the factory floor at Ford’s River Rouge complex in Dearborn, watching F-150 pickup trucks move through different stages of production. The F-150 is the bestselling domestically produced vehicle in the US. He observed how gas-powered and hybrid versions are assembled, along with the all-gas Raptor model built for off-road performance.Wearing a suit amid workers in reflective vests, Trump stopped to chat with assembly line employees, some of whom applauded as he arrived, and spoke with Ford executive chairman Bill Ford. “All US automakers are doing great,” Trump said, later adding that the “quality is unbelievable,"" as quoted by the Associated Press.After leaving the plant, Trump headed to MotorCity Casino, where he addressed members of the Detroit Economic Club. He framed the speech as a straightforward exercise in listing his administration’s accomplishments. “This is the easiest speech to make,” Trump said, explaining that all he was doing was “spewing off what the hell we’ve done.”“Right now I'm feeling pretty good,” he added.Despite the confident tone, recent election results suggest many voters remain unconvinced. Tuesday’s stop marked Trump’s third visit to a swing state since last month focused on economic messaging, following Republican losses in off-year elections in Virginia, New Jersey and other states where concerns about everyday expenses dominated.The White House said after the trip that Trump plans to travel more frequently to make his economic case directly to the public and address lingering financial fears.Trump previously dismissed affordability concerns as a “hoax” fueled by Democrats. At the same time, his administration has imposed sweeping tariffs on US trading partners, while selectively easing some measures affecting the auto industry, including extending import levies on foreign-made auto parts until 2030.Speaking on the factory floor, Trump highlighted tariffs on vehicles imported from China and said he hopes to prevail at the Supreme Court, which is reviewing the legality of his broader tariff strategy.He also downplayed the relevance of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, the North American trade deal he negotiated during his first term, suggesting it is no longer necessary for the US. The USMCA is scheduled for review this year.Earlier, before departing Washington, Trump had pointed to encouraging inflation data as evidence his economic approach is working. December figures showed inflation eased slightly as gas and used-car prices declined. Consumer prices rose 0.3 per cent in December from the previous month, matching November’s increase, according to the Labor Department. “We have very low inflation,” Trump told reporters on the White House lawn, adding that “growth is going up. We have tremendous growth numbers.”Even so, surveys continue to show Americans remain worried about inflation and rising daily expenses.Trump’s effort to refocus attention on economic growth comes amid controversy over his Justice Department opening a criminal investigation into Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Powell has described the move as a direct attempt to undermine the Fed’s independence on interest rates, a view echoed by former central bank leaders, economic officials and some Republican lawmakers.Asked about the investigation before heading to Michigan, Trump repeated his long-standing criticisms of Powell but declined to comment on the case itself.The Michigan visit also intersected with the administration’s rollback of electric vehicle policies. Ford announced in December that it was abandoning plans for an electric F-150, despite heavy investment in electrification, after the Trump administration cut targets for EV sales by 2030, eliminated tax credits and proposed easing emissions and fuel economy standards.Trump’s stop followed similar economy-focused appearances last month in Pennsylvania and North Carolina. In Pennsylvania, remarks about immigrants from “filthy” countries overshadowed his inflation message. In North Carolina, he argued that tariffs had strengthened the economy, even as residents complained of higher prices. Like Michigan, Pennsylvania’s event was also held at a casino, the Mount Airy Casino Resort.Trump carried Michigan in 2016 and again in 2024, after losing the state to Democrat Joe Biden in 2020. He marked his first 100 days in office with a rally-style speech outside Detroit, where he focused heavily on past political grievances rather than detailed economic plans.During that earlier visit, Trump also appeared at Selfridge Air National Guard Base and announced a new fighter jet mission, easing concerns about the base’s future. The move was welcomed by Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, who shared a hug with the president at the time.Democrats sharply criticised Tuesday’s trip. They pointed to national Republicans’ opposition to extending health care subsidies and recalled Trump’s comments during an October 2024 address to the Detroit Economic Club, when he warned that another Democratic term would leave the country in ruins. “Our whole country will end up being like Detroit,” Trump had said then. “You’re going to have a mess on your hands,” he added.Curtis Hertel, chair of the Michigan Democratic Party, accused Trump of political opportunism. “After spending months claiming that affordability was a ‘hoax’ and creating a health care crisis for Michiganders, Donald Trump is now coming to Detroit — a city he hates — to tout his billionaire-first agenda while working families suffer,” Hertel said in a statement. “Michiganders are feeling the effects of Trump’s economy every day,” he added.","Trump walked the factory floor at Ford’s River Rouge complex in Dearborn, watching F-150 pickup trucks move through different stages of production.

The researcher making music education personal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/the-researcher-making-music-education-personal/articleshow/126509898.cms,"Imagine a ten-year-old who hears a song and decides, for the first time, that she wants to learn piano. She's excited, motivated, ready to practice. But when she finds the sheet music, it's far too advanced. The pages of dense chords and rapid passages that would take years to master. Her options? Grind through beginner exercises that have nothing to do with the song she loves, or give up entirely. Most kids give up.This scenario plays out millions of times every year, and it points to a fundamental gap in music education: the music people want to play rarely matches the music they're ready to play. What if technology could bridge that gap by automatically adapting any song to any skill level, creating a personalized path from the first lesson to full performance?This is the problem Pedro Ramoneda has dedicated his career to solving. A researcher at the forefront of artificial intelligence and music, Ramoneda has developed breakthrough technology that can analyze how difficult a piece of music is to perform and then generate simplified versions tailored to a student's abilities. His work opens the door to a new era of truly personalized music education, where the curriculum adapts to the learner, not the other way around.Ramoneda completed his doctoral research at the Music Technology Group of Universitat Pompeu Fabra in Barcelona, one of the world's leading centers for music technology, under the supervision of Professor Xavier Serra.A talented pianist himself, he explains that his ""goal was to reduce the gap between the motivational spark a musician has to learn a song and the available tools students, teachers, and institutions had to kindle that spark into a flame. "" His approach ""places the performer at the center and understands music as a creative and educational activity, not only as a consumer product.""His research has earned recognition at the field's most prestigious international venues, including ISMIR, ACM Multimedia, and ICASSP, and has been published in leading academic journals. In 2024, Universitat Pompeu Fabra honored him with the Open Science Award for the best use of open data in a doctoral thesis. Dr. Dasaem Jeong, Professor at Sogang University in South Korea and one of Ramoneda's key international collaborators, describes him as ""one of the world's most talented music information retrieval researchers,"" noting that his work ""applying state-of-the-art AI/ML methodologies to music leveling has established himself as a global pioneer in the space. ""Ramoneda's expertise has also attracted the attention of the world's largest music technology companies. Sony's Computer Science Laboratories in Tokyo funded a research internship where he worked on AI-powered music generation, and he completed additional research at Yamaha's R&D division focused on creating personalized practice exercises for students. These collaborations reflect a growing industry recognition that adaptive music technology represents the future of how people learn to play.Now, Ramoneda is bringing his research from the lab to the real world. He recently joined Songscription , a U.S.-based education technology startup whose mission is to ""empower musicians worldwide to play, share, and learn the songs they love."" The company has developed AI that can automatically transcribe audio into sheet music and recently raised funding to expand its research team. Andrew Carlins, Songscription's Co-Founder and CEO, explains the hire: ""Most musicians—and most of our user base—are amateurs. Being able to turn any song into sheet music tailored for a specific level of play would be a complete game changer with the potential to finally make music accessible to millions of people who historically have been left out. We hired Pedro because we believed that if there was anyone in the world who could solve this problem, it was him.""The implications extend beyond Western classical training. Raman Khanna—Stanford University's former Chief Information Officer, current Managing Director of Dell Technologies Capital, and an angel investor in Songscription—sees potential for preserving and sharing musical traditions worldwide. ""Indian classical music has been an oral tradition with limited ways to notate,"" he explains. ""Songscription's technology creates a way to automatically transcribe ancient melodies so we can ensure they will be preserved for future generations. And if they can successfully develop technology that automates music leveling, it stands to make genres like Indian classical music more accessible to millions of amateur musicians globally.""For generations, music education has followed a one-size-fits-all model: standardized curricula, fixed progressions, and a long road before students get to play the music that inspired them in the first place. Ramoneda's research points toward something different: a future where learning music is as personalized as the playlists we listen to. That ten-year-old with a favorite song? She might finally have a way to start playing it on day one.",Pedro Ramoneda is a researcher at the forefront of artificial intelligence and music. He has developed breakthrough technology that can analyze how difficult a piece of music is to perform and then generate simplified versions tailored to a student's abilities.

US Threatens 25% Tariff on India-Iran Trade, Indian Rice Exporters Warn of Losses

US consumer inflation remained steady in December, suggesting that price pressures are gradually easing, even as core necessities like food and housing continue to burden American households, government data showed Tuesday.Consumer prices rose 0.3% from November, unchanged from the previous month, while core inflation—excluding volatile food and energy—also climbed 0.2%, according to the Labour Department, reported news agency AP.On a year-on-year basis, the CPI rose 2.7%, while core inflation increased 2.6%, both matching November’s figures.Economists said the data indicate inflation may have peaked. “The recent run of figures suggests inflation has peaked,” Michael Pearce, chief US economist at Oxford Economics, noted.Falling gas and used car prices helped moderate the overall increase, though grocery prices jumped 0.7% month-on-month, and food costs rose 2.4% compared with a year ago. Electricity costs increased nearly 7% and natural gas by 11% in 2025, adding to affordability pressures, reported news agency AFP.The Federal Reserve has reduced its key interest rate by a quarter-point in December but is expected to remain cautious before further cuts.John Williams, president of the New York Fed, said tariffs have likely raised inflation by about half a percentage point, though underlying trends are favourable, with inflation expected to decline toward 2% by 2027.Analysts highlighted that with inflation fears easing, the Fed may have flexibility to respond to downside risks in the labour market, but the recent DOJ grand jury investigation into Fed Chair Jerome Powell introduces additional uncertainty.President Donald Trump celebrated the inflation figures on social media, calling them “Great (LOW!) Inflation numbers for the USA” and urging Powell to cut rates “MEANINGFULLY!!!”He also praised estimates of solid fourth-quarter growth and claimed credit for tariff measures impacting the economy.Despite the moderation in headline inflation, persistent increases in essentials such as food, rent, and utilities continue to strain household budgets, highlighting the ongoing political and economic challenges facing the US administration and the Fed.","Consumer prices rose 0.3% from November, unchanged from the previous month.

Iran's Economy in Crisis: Unrest Driven by Collapsing Rial and Striking Merchants,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/currency-shock-will-a-collapsing-rial-be-undoing-of-irans-supreme-leader-khamenei/articleshow/126503562.cms,"TL:DR: Driving the news



The Iranian rial ’s plunge to roughly 1.4 million per US dollar in late December shattered already fragile markets and triggered strikes in Tehran’s Grand Bazaar.

’s plunge to roughly 1.4 million per US dollar in late December shattered already fragile markets and triggered strikes in Tehran’s Grand Bazaar. What began as merchant walkouts has cascaded into protests spanning students, truck drivers and ordinary households across all 31 provinces, amid rolling internet blackouts and power cuts.

US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency estimates at least 2,000 deaths and more than 10,000 arrests.

This is the largest and most economically broad-based challenge to the Islamic Republic since the regime crushed the 2022 “Woman, Life, Freedom” movement.

Why it matters



The current unrest strikes at the Islamic Republic’s most sensitive nerve: its ability to provide economic survival, not ideological legitimacy.

Unlike earlier uprisings centered on social freedoms, this revolt is pulling in lower-income Iranians and the shrinking middle class at the same time, a convergence analysts told Foreign Policy has long worried the regime.

Bazaar strikes carry historic weight. Merchants were pivotal in the 1979 revolution, when coordinated economic noncooperation accelerated the shah’s fall. The parallel is imperfect - but not lost on Tehran.

Regionally, Iran is more exposed than at any time since the revolution. Its proxy network has been degraded, Syria’s Assad fell in 2024, and Israel damaged Iran’s missile and nuclear infrastructure in the June 2025 war, per Bloomberg.

In short: the state is poorer, weaker abroad, and facing a broader domestic coalition than before.





The big picture



Zoom in: life under collapse



Water rationing now hits parts of Tehran for hours at a time, while other districts face rolling blackouts.

Food insecurity has spread into once-stable households. One source described seeing a man tear chicken wings off in a supermarket and flee - a scene echoed by similar accounts in Western reporting.

Inflation, already above 40% for years, has hollowed out wages. Economists cited by the NYT estimate purchasing power has fallen to a third or less of what it was a decade ago.

The protests’ geographic spread - from major cities to marginalized provinces already battered by drought and poverty - reflects this shared precarity.

What they are saying

Between the lines



What's next



Iran is again convulsed by nationwide unrest - but this time the spark is not culture or identity. It is money.The immediate trigger was a policy fight over Iran’s preferential exchange rate, set at 285,000 rials per dollar - a system widely viewed as a corruption pipeline for regime insiders.President Masoud Pezeshkian’s administration argued the rate fuels rent-seeking and distorts markets.When parliament rejected the budget proposal, confidence collapsed. The rial slid, inventories became impossible to price, and normal commerce froze - especially in import-heavy sectors like electronics and mobile phones.The graph from a currency tracker shows $1 equal to nearly 1,137,500 Iranian rials as of January 12. In purely technical terms, it’s just a graph. In political terms, it’s a snapshot of governance failing at the level of daily life: The point where normal pricing stops working, salaries become fiction, and a middle class realizes it is being pushed into survival mode.As one Iran-based source told Foreign Policy, the rage was twofold: Anger at corruption and fear that removing subsidies without safeguards would immediately spike food prices.That mix turned a technical debate into a street-level revolt.For many Iranians, the crisis is no longer about hardship - it’s about survival.The regime’s message is clear: sympathy on the surface, repression underneath.Judiciary chief Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejei vowed “no leniency” for those deemed “rioters,” urging judges to move quickly and “firmly”.Foreign minister Abbas Araghchi claimed the situation was “under total control,” blaming Israel and the US for violence while saying Iran remained “open to diplomacy” in comments carried by Al Jazeera.Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei warned the Islamic Republic “will not back down”.Outside Iran, President Donald Trump has raised the stakes. He warned publicly that if Tehran “shoots and violently kills peaceful protesters,” the US would strike Iran “very hard”.Tehran is taking it seriously after Washington’s seizure of Venezuela’s Nicolás Maduro.Despite appearances, the regime is not cornered - yet.The appointment of hard-liner Ahmad Vahidi to a senior IRGC role signals readiness to escalate. Sources say the Guards declared a “yellow” emergency, stopping short of full mobilization but tightening control.Crucially, senior bazaaris and regime-linked oligarchs remain on the sidelines. Wealthier merchants are insulated from daily currency swings and deeply embedded in patronage networks; they have far more to lose from chaos than from repression.The opposition remains fragmented. Analysts quoted by Bloomberg and Reuters describe bitter splits between monarchists backing Reza Pahlavi and rival camps wary of any single “savior.”As one political analyst put it: “Anger is abundant. Coordination is scarce.”History suggests three broad paths - none guaranteed.Economic shock absorber: Tehran could restore preferential exchange rates at a higher level, reopen rent channels and calm markets, relying on targeted arrests rather than mass bloodshed.Escalation and repression: If protests expand into sustained strikes in transport, energy and public services, the regime may calculate that overwhelming force is worth the cost.Slow unraveling: A prolonged stalemate - grinding poverty, intermittent unrest and tighter security - could hollow out the system without dramatic collapse.For regime change to become real, several things would need to shift at once: elite defections, protesters holding territory, disciplined nationwide noncooperation, and - most critically - a credible vision of the “day after” that reassures fence-sitters and neighbors alike.Iran’s proverb looms large: “Same donkey, different saddle.” Many Iranians don’t want a cosmetic swap at the top; they want a clean break from a corrupt machine.The Islamic Republic is arguably weaker than it has ever been. But as decades of uprisings show, weakness does not automatically translate into collapse - especially when fear of chaos still rivals hope for change.(With inputs from agencies)","Iran is again convulsed by nationwide unrest - but this time the spark is not culture or identity.

Trump's 25% Tariff Threat on Iran: Implications for US-China Trade Truce,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/25-tariff-threat-trumps-iran-move-rattles-beijing-will-it-upend-us-china-truce/articleshow/126501235.cms,"Tl;DR: Driving the news

Trump has thrown a fresh wildcard into global trade by threatening to impose 25% tariffs on any country that continues to do business with Iran - a move that could destabilize the fragile trade truce between the US and China.

In a social media post Monday, Trump wrote that “Any Country doing business with the Islamic Republic of Iran will pay a Tariff of 25% on any and all business being done with the United States of America,” adding the measure would be “effective immediately.” He did not spell out how the tariffs would be applied, what legal authority he would rely on, or whether specific sectors or products would be targeted.

Bloomberg reports the announcement immediately raised alarms in Beijing, where officials and businesses are acutely aware that China is Iran’s largest trading partner and the world’s biggest buyer of Iranian oil.

The timing is delicate: The threat comes just months after Washington and Beijing agreed to pause their bruising trade war, cutting tariffs and restoring access to strategic resources such as rare earth minerals.

Trump Threatens To ‘Strangle’ Iran Ahead Of Attack, Blackmails India, China With 25% Tariffs

The context: Iran is on edge

Why it matters

At stake is not just another tariff skirmish, but the durability of a US-China trade détente that both sides have incentives to preserve.

The October truce reached between Trump and Xi Jinping eased pressure on global markets and supply chains after years of tit-for-tat escalation. Bloomberg Economics estimates that the average US tariff rate on Chinese goods dropped to 30.8% from 40.8% following the deal.

That rollback helped stabilize prices for US consumers and reassured American manufacturers reliant on Chinese inputs. For Beijing, it delivered relief to exporters and reopened access to US technology and markets - while also ensuring continued US access to Chinese rare earths critical for electronics, clean energy and military hardware.

Trump’s Iran tariff threat now risks reopening wounds both sides had agreed to stitch up.

Wendy Cutler, a former senior US trade negotiator now at the Asia Society Policy Institute, told Bloomberg that the move “underscores just how fragile the trade truce is between Washington and Beijing.” She added that “even if Trump does not actually go through with this tariff threat, some damage has already been done” to bilateral trust.

The US-China trade truce under strain

What they are saying

Trump has framed the move as part of a renewed “maximum pressure” campaign against Iran, which is facing its most serious anti-government protests in years.

“This Order is final and conclusive,” Trump said in a separate social media post, according to Reuters, again without detailing the scope or enforcement of the tariffs.

China responded sharply. The Chinese embassy in Washington said Beijing would take “all necessary measures” to safeguard its interests and opposed “any illicit unilateral sanctions and long-arm jurisdiction.”

That language echoes China’s longstanding criticism of US sanctions policy, which it argues violates international norms and harms global trade.

Between the lines

What’s next

The biggest unanswered question is whether Trump’s threat becomes formal policy.

Reuters reports there has been no official White House documentation outlining how the tariffs would be imposed, which legal authorities would be used, or whether all of Iran’s trading partners would be targeted equally.

That uncertainty alone is enough to rattle markets and complicate diplomacy.

Bloomberg notes the risk is especially acute as Trump eyes an April visit to Beijing - a trip expected to reinforce the October truce and showcase a stabilizing US-China relationship.

Oil markets are already reacting. Prices climbed to seven-week highs on concerns that Iranian exports could fall if enforcement tightens or if buyers retreat to avoid US penalties.

For Beijing, the calculus is complex: push back forcefully and risk escalation, or wait to see if Trump follows through - a familiar dilemma after years of trade brinkmanship.

US President Donald Trump’s favorite economic weapon is back on the table, but this time it’s pointed in an unexpected direction: Iran.Iran is entering its third week of unrest with the kind of grim arithmetic that changes diplomatic equations: activists say over 600 people have been killed and more than 10,000 detained, while the state has tightened an information blackout that makes verification harder and escalation easier.Now the crisis is spilling outward - into the familiar geometry of US-Iran brinkmanship - with President claiming Tehran is looking for a way out, even as he threatens new punishment and keeps military options on the table.Trump told reporters his administration is preparing for talks but may not wait: “A meeting is being set up, but we may have to act because of what is happening before the meeting,” he said on Air Force One.. He also framed Iran’s posture as weakness under pressure: “I think they’re tired of being beat up by the United States,” Trump said. “Iran wants to negotiate.”Iran’s public tone suggests defiance, not retreat. Yet Iranian officials are also carefully signaling that diplomacy is not off the table - so long as it doesn’t look like capitulation.Iranian foreign ministry spokesman Esmail Baghaei said a channel to the US remained open, but talks must be “based on the acceptance of mutual interests and concerns, not a negotiation that is one-sided, unilateral and based on dictation.”While Iran looms large strategically, its economic footprint in China’s overall trade picture is relatively small - but highly concentrated.Reuters data show that China is Iran’s largest trading partner. Iranian exports to China totaled about $22 billion in 2022, with fuels accounting for more than half. Imports from China stood at roughly $15 billion.In 2025, China bought more than 80% of Iran’s shipped oil, according to Kpler data cited by Reuters, reflecting Tehran’s dependence on Beijing as sanctions have narrowed its customer base.For China, that discounted oil is essential. It fuels private refiners that operate on thin margins and supports an economy already grappling with slowing growth, property-sector stress and weak consumer confidence.Beyond oil, China exports machinery, vehicles, electronics, refrigeration equipment and industrial components to Iran. Those sectors could face indirect exposure if US tariffs were applied broadly to countries trading with Tehran.Still, two-way trade with Iran accounts for less than 0.2% of China’s total trade, Bloomberg notes - limiting the macroeconomic hit, but not the strategic implications.While China sits at the center of the Iran trade nexus, Trump’s 25% tariff threat casts a much wider net- putting pressure on a diverse group of US partners and rivals with very different exposure to Tehran.India is among the most sensitive cases. Reuters reports that India’s bilateral trade with Iran totaled about $1.34 billion in the first 10 months of 2025, dominated by Indian exports such as basmati rice, pharmaceuticals, fruits and vegetables. New Delhi sharply reduced Iranian oil imports in recent years due to international sanctions, but it still relies on Iran for regional connectivity projects and limited trade flows. A blanket tariff threat could complicate India’s effort to balance strategic ties with Washington against regional interests in the Middle East.For Japan and South Korea, the risk is less about volume and more about precedent. Both countries maintain only modest trade with Iran- mostly machinery, vehicle parts and small volumes of food products - and both finalized trade arrangements with the US last year. Reuters reports that officials in Tokyo and Seoul said they are closely monitoring the situation, signaling concern that secondary tariffs could undercut hard-won trade stability with Washington.Turkey faces a different dilemma. As a major regional trading partner of Iran, Turkey imported and exported billions of dollars’ worth of goods in 2022, according to World Bank data cited by Reuters. Ankara has historically resisted US pressure to fully sever economic ties with Tehran, and Trump’s threat raises the prospect of renewed friction between Nato allies over sanctions enforcement and trade retaliation.Beyond those countries, Reuters notes that Iran trades with more than 140 partners globally, including the United Arab Emirates and Iraq. Many of those economies act as transit hubs or intermediaries rather than direct end-users - raising complex questions about how Washington would define “doing business” with Iran, and whether indirect trade could also trigger penalties.Trump’s threat doesn’t just target Iran’s biggest buyers - it tests how far US allies and partners are willing to align with Washington’s Iran strategy when the cost could be tariffs on all their US-bound exports.The October agreement between Trump and Xi was narrowly constructed and always vulnerable to external shocks.It did not resolve deeper disputes over industrial policy, technology transfer or national security. Instead, it focused on freezing tariffs at current levels and restoring access to strategic materials - particularly rare earths, which China dominates globally.During the earlier trade dispute, Beijing imposed export curbs on rare earths, highlighting a choke point Washington is keenly aware of. The truce ensured US companies could again source those minerals, which are vital for everything from smartphones to fighter jets.Bloomberg Economics data underscore how meaningful the détente was: a nearly 10 percentage-point drop in average US tariffs on Chinese imports translated into billions of dollars in avoided costs for US firms.Trump’s Iran tariff threat jeopardizes that stability by introducing uncertainty over whether China could once again become a target - this time indirectly, via its ties to Tehran.Trump’s Iran tariff threat highlights a recurring pattern in his trade and foreign policy: maximalist rhetoric paired with ambiguous follow-through.Bloomberg points out that just months earlier, in June, Trump surprised oil traders and officials within his own administration by signaling that China could continue buying Iranian oil - a move that appeared to undercut Washington’s longstanding Iran policy.That mixed messaging reflects competing priorities. On one hand, Trump wants to squeeze Tehran amid domestic unrest and geopolitical confrontation. On the other, he is wary of actions that could spike oil prices, hurt US consumers, or destabilize relations with Beijing.History offers a clue. In August last year, White House adviser Peter Navarro downplayed the idea of further tariffs on China over its purchases of Russian oil. “We have over 50% tariffs on China,” Navarro said at the time, according to Bloomberg. “We don’t want to get to a point where we hurt ourselves.”The Iran tariff threat revives that same tension - between leverage and self-inflicted damage.(With inputs from agencies)",Trump threatens to impose 25% tariffs on any country doing business with Iran. The move could destabilize the fragile trade truce between the US and China. China is Iran's largest trading partner and the world's biggest buyer of Iranian oil. The threat comes just months after Washington and Beijing agreed to pause their bruising trade war.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126501650,imgsize-1100624,width-400,resizemode-4/trump-khamenei-xi.jpg"

Gold shines amid uncertainty

Asian share markets rose on Tuesday, led by a strong rally in Japanese stocks as investors bet on technology and AI-led growth. At the same time, uncertainty over the independence of the US Federal Reserve lifted gold prices and pressured the dollar.Japan’s Nikkei index surged after reopening from a holiday, jumping 3.4% to record highs as a weaker yen and expectations of fiscal stimulus lifted sentiment. Gains in Japan helped push regional markets higher, with South Korean and Taiwanese stocks also touching all-time peaks, while Chinese blue-chip shares climbed to a four-year high.MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.8% to a fresh record. In Europe, EUROSTOXX 50 futures gained 0.2%, Germany’s DAX futures added 0.1%, while FTSE futures were flat, according to Reuters.Analysts said that enthusiasm around artificial intelligence continued to support global equities.“We see global equities continuing to climb in 2026, targeting around 10% upside for the MSCI AC World by year-end,” Citi analysts said, while cautioning that high valuations leave little room for disappointment if earnings fall short.US stock futures edged lower ahead of key inflation data, with S&P 500 futures down 0.2% and Nasdaq futures off 0.3%. Markets are awaiting the December US consumer price index, with forecasts pointing to core inflation rising to 2.7%, though some expect a higher reading of 2.8%.The US earnings season also begins this week, with major banks including JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Bank of America due to report.Bank executives are expected to face questions over President Donald Trump ’s call for a one-year cap on credit card interest rates at 10% starting January 20. Banks have warned such a move could restrict access to credit for millions of households and small businesses.Investors were wondering how the US Justice Department’s criminal investigation into Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell could affect markets.

“US Using Tariffs To Pressure India” Sareen Slams Trump Over Russia Sanction Bill

US President Donald Trump on Monday warned that Washington could face severe financial repercussions if the Supreme Court rules his sweeping global tariffs illegal. The warning comes as the country’s top court prepares to hear the high-stakes case this week.In a post on Truth Social, Trump wrote: “If the Supreme Court rules against the United States of America on this National Security bonanza, we're scre***!”The nation's apex body is expected to issue rulings as early as January 14, though it does not announce in advance which cases will be decided. The challenge to Trump’s tariffs has emerged as a major test of presidential authority and could have wide-ranging implications for the US and global economy.Trump’s warning comes amid legal scrutiny of tariffs imposed under the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), which he invoked by declaring a national emergency over the US trade deficit.During oral arguments in November, a majority of judges had expressed skepticism about whether the law allows a president to impose broad global tariffs without congressional approval.In his Truth Social post, Trump said the financial exposure would go far beyond tariff revenues already collected.He argued that if the court rules against the government, the US could be forced to repay “many Hundreds of Billions of Dollars” in tariff revenue, along with additional claims tied to private investments made to avoid the levies.“The actual numbers that we would have to pay back if, for any reason, the Supreme Court were to rule against the United States of America on Tariffs, would be many Hundreds of Billions of Dollars and that doesn’t include the amount of “payback” that Countries and Companies would require for the Investments they are making on building Plants, Factories, and Equipment, for the purpose of being able to avoid the payment of Tariffs. ” Trump wrote.“When these Investments are added, we are talking about Trillions of Dollars! It would be a complete mess, and almost impossible for our Country to pay,” Trump further wrote.He rejected suggestions that refunds could be handled quickly, saying the process would be complex and drawn out.“Anybody who says that it can be quickly and easily done would be making a false, inaccurate, or totally misunderstood answer to this very large and complex question. It may not be possible but, if it were, it would be Dollars that would be so large that it would take many years to figure out what number we are talking about and even, who, when, and where, to pay,” his post read.According to government data, the federal government collected roughly $200 billion more in tariff revenue in 2025 as a result of Trump’s import duties. Tariffs are paid by companies when they bring goods into the US. More than half of that revenue has come from tariffs imposed under IEEPA.Trump has repeatedly argued that the tariffs strengthened US manufacturing and boosted investment.Lower courts have already ruled against the administration. A federal appeals court in August upheld a finding that Trump exceeded his authority by imposing global tariffs under emergency powers.The case now before the Supreme Court was brought by a group of businesses and 12 US states, most of them governed by Democrats, who argue that only Congress has the constitutional power to impose taxes and that IEEPA does not mention tariffs.Opponents also dispute whether trade deficits qualify as a national emergency. At the November hearing, Justice Amy Coney Barrett observed that any refund process could become a “complete mess,” a phrase Trump later echoed.Trump has said he is preparing a “Game 2 plan” to pursue his tariff agenda if the court rules against him, though he has acknowledged that alternative legal routes would be slower, according to USA Today.A ruling against the tariffs would deal a major blow to one of the centrepieces of his domestic and trade policy and could reshape US relations with key trading partners, including the European Union, Japan, South Korea, the UK and India.","US President Donald Trump on Monday warned that Washington could face severe financial repercussions if the Supreme Court rules his sweeping global tariffs illegal.

'Fed' up Trump launches probe into central bank chief,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/fed-up-trump-launches-probe-into-central-bank-chief/articleshow/126489018.cms,"Photo credit- AP

Trump Ignites WW3 Over Greenland? Denmark PM Warns Of ‘Decisive Moment’ As NATO ‘Readies’ Troops

: US President Donald Trump is on the warpath against Venezuela, Cuba, Iran, Greenland -- and the Federal Reserve. In a move that has rattled financial markets and political circles alike, the Trump administration’s Justice Department has launched a criminal investigation into Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, marking an unprecedented clash between the executive branch and the nation’s central bank.The probe, confirmed late Sunday by Powell himself, centers on statements he made during June testimony before the Senate Banking Committee about cost overruns on a long-running renovation of the Federal Reserve’s headquarters in Washington, DC, which Trump has characterized as a scandal. This development comes as the President has repeatedly expressed frustration with the Fed's reluctance to slash interest rates, a policy he claims is stifling economic growth.The investigation, which Powell says began with grand jury subpoenas served to the Federal Reserve, threatens the chair with potential criminal charges—a move he described in a video message as “unprecedented” and a threat to the independence of the Federal Reserve. He insisted that the subpoenas are being used as a tool of political pressure, not because there is credible evidence of wrongdoing.The controversy has its roots in a multi-year project to renovate the nearly 90-year-old Marriner S.Eccles Building and adjacent offices, a project first approved by the Fed’s board in 2017. Originally projected to cost about $1.9 billion, the current estimate stands near $2.5 billion, reflecting inflation, supply chain disruptions, asbestos abatement, and unforeseen construction challenges.Trump, who appointed Powell in 2018 and whose second term began in January 2025, has repeatedly assailed the Fed for its refusal to cut interest rates as aggressively as he desires. Lower interest rates are widely popular with investors and borrowers because they reduce borrowing costs and can stimulate economic growth—a key element of Trump’s economic strategy. But the Fed, tasked with controlling inflation and maintaining long-term economic stability, has kept rates at levels it deems appropriate given lingering inflationary pressures.Trump’s criticism of Powell intensified over the renovation costs after he took office last January. He has publicly derided the project as excessive and has even joked about firing Powell over it—though legally, the Fed Chair can only be removed “for cause,” and not at the president’s whim.Powell, in turn, has corrected the president’s public statements about the project’s costs, noting that Trump has, on occasion, overstated figures or conflated unrelated expenditures. Trump himself is splurging up to $ 400 million – from an initial estimate of $ 200 million – on a new ballroom attached to the White House, which critics say is over-the-top.The criminal inquiry was reportedly authorized last November by US. Attorney Jeanine Pirro, Trump’s appointee in the District of Columbia, and involves a review of Powell’s public testimony and internal spending records. Officials familiar with the matter say prosecutors have contacted Fed staff seeking documents related to the renovation.The legal escalation has galvanized lawmakers across party lines, including some from the GOP. Republican Senator Thom Tillis, a member of the Senate Banking Committee, vowed to block all Fed nominations—including Powell’s potential successor, possibly Trump surrogate Kevin Hassett—until the investigation concludes, warning that the move undermines both Fed and Justice Department independence. Some Democratic lawmakers and economists have drawn parallels to historical assaults on central bank autonomy, cautioning that politicizing the Fed could erode market confidence and destabilize the broader financial system.Markets reacted swiftly. US. stocks fell sharply, with the S&P 500 sliding more than 1 percent on Monday before recovering, as investors grappled with the uncertainty. The US dollar weakened, and gold prices surged to record highs above $4,600 an ounce, a traditional safe haven during times of institutional stress. Analysts warn that any perceived encroachment on the Fed’s independence could inject long-term volatility into stocks, bonds, and currencies.Supporters of the investigation, particularly among segments of Trump’s political base, argue that Powell should be held accountable if he indeed misled Congress or mismanaged federal resources. Conservative commentators have characterized the central bank as an unaccountable “fourth branch” of government, and some have cheered Trump’s willingness to challenge it.But critics—ranging from mainstream economists to former Treasury officials—say the probe risks undermining the very foundation of US monetary policy. The Federal Reserve’s independence, established by law and respected by both Democratic and Republican administrations for decades, is widely credited with enabling policy decisions insulated from short-term political pressures. Eroding that independence could complicate efforts to tame inflation or respond to future recessions, with repercussions across the globe.Powell, whose term as Fed Chair is set to expire in May 2026, has vowed not to resign and to continue fulfilling the Fed’s dual mandate: price stability and maximum employment. “Public service sometimes requires standing firm in the face of threats,” he said, defiantly pushing back against Trump.As Washington wrestles with this extraordinary confrontation between the executive branch and a cornerstone of the economic establishment, investors and policymakers alike are watching closely. What began as a dispute over interest rates and construction costs has ballooned into a national debate over institutional independence, democratic norms, and the future of US. economic governance.","The Justice Department has launched a criminal investigation into Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.

NEW DELHI: More than 1.14 lakh startups in India have created over 12 lakh jobs so far, the finance ministry said in its latest review of the Indian economy.In the report titled, ‘The Indian Economy: A Review January 2024’, the Department of Economic Affairs said that the 1.14 lakh startups recognised by the government under the 'Startup India initiative’ created more than 12 lakh jobs (as of October 2023).The state-owned e-commerce platform Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) clocked more than 63 lakh transactions till November 2023, the document read.Despite facing global challenges in 2023 like valuation issues, few IPOs, regulatory changes and macroeconomic and geopolitical trends, India remains the third largest tech start-up ecosystem globally, with over 950 tech startups founded last year.The cumulative funding for more than 31,000 tech start ups has exceeded $70 billion (from 2019 to 2023), according to a recent report by Nasscom in collaboration with Zinnov.“In 2023, despite facing global economic and regulatory challenges, Indian tech startups have prioritised the imperative of enhancing their business fundamentals, driving profitability and growth,” said Debjani Ghosh, President, Nasscom.“The proliferation of tech startups in tier 2 and 3 cities marks the ecosystem's resilience,” she added.Navigating 2024, tech startup founders expect to continue the revenue growth path with measured steps focusing on optimising expenditure and maximising profitability for B2B tech startups.Investments in deeptech will continue an upward trend in 2024.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor (CEA) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran Udaan until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.Udaan built an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business still accounts for a very small part of India’s overall retail market but can balloon to $150 billion in sales and yield a 100% return on capital invested in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co. estimates published in the Mint newspaper.Bengaluru-based Udaan has also ventured into financing through its fintech unit which helps shopkeepers get working capital loans to buy inventory. That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says.

SAR imagery provides much higher resolution than other forms of remote sensing technology such as hyperspectral and multispectral. SAR is a critical technology for strategic reconnaissance and planning as well as for disaster management.According to Misra, winning the challenge in just over a year of floating the company is a major booster.He said L and P band SAR have an advantage over other frequencies (like X band) when it comes to penetration capabilities through rain, clouds, foliage and vegetation in a tropical country like India, and underground penetration capabilities in dry terrain.Continuing further, he said the L band SAR will provide 1 metre resolution, spotlight resolution in Stripmap mode. The current industry standard is 5-10 metre in L band. Misra said both the L and P band will operate simultaneously from a satellite borne SAR.

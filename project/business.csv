'Largest' tax refunds? How much cash will actually hit Americans’ bank accounts?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/largest-tax-refunds-how-much-cash-will-actually-hit-americans-bank-accounts/articleshow/125923537.cms,"White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt

How much each Americans will get?



Americans, you can rejoice as your wallet just got good news, even before the world gets its hands on GTA 6.On Thursday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said that Americans can expect an extra amount in their bank accounts in the months ahead, all because of Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which he signed into law in July.Leavitt told reporters, “Americans can expect another boost in their bank accounts in the months ahead.” She added that 2026 tax refunds are “projected to be the largest ever thanks to President [Donald] Trump’s passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill.”Citing analysis from investment bank Piper Sandler, Leavitt said refunds “could be about one-third larger than usual, or roughly an extra $1,000 per filer.”On Wednesday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told reporters that working Americans would receive “very large refunds” next year, amounting to about $1,000 to $2,000 per household. He said the increased refunds were a direct result of the tax cuts in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.The cost of living has been a central concern for many Americans in recent months. Democrats have criticised the Trump administration over affordability issues, while Republicans have backed the president’s tax legislation as delivering relief.In an X post on December 4, the White House said, Largest tax refund season in American history.Thanks to extended tax cuts and retroactive tax relief provided by the Working Family Tax Cuts.Representative Brendan Boyle, a Pennsylvanian Democrat, said in a December 9 X post, Trump called the cost-of-living crisis a ‘con,’ but now he’s in Pennsylvania claiming he’s lowering costs. His empty promises are the real con — and Pennsylvanians aren’t buying it. This is the same guy raising prices with his tariff taxes and taking health care from Americans.House Speaker Mike Johnson said in a December 10 X post, This is a LIFE-CHANGING boost for America’s children. And remember: Nearly EVERY Democrat voted to block this from happening.Taxes are due on April 15-2026. Americans typically receive their tax refunds within weeks of filing.","White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said that 2026 tax refunds are “projected to be the largest ever thanks to President [Donald] Trump’s passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill.” She said refunds “could be about one-third larger than usual, or roughly an extra $1,000 per filer”","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125923620,imgsize-892020,width-400,resizemode-4/pic-22.jpg"

Silver continues to outperform gold this year, rising more than 3% last week while gold also surged significantly breaching the $4300 mark. After a sharp rally, silver ended the week with some profit booking, but the broader trend remains firm. Strong industrial demand, safe-haven flows, and tight physical supplies continue to support prices. Investor interest is clearly visible, with silver-backed ETF inflows since the start of this month.On the macro front, US core PCE inflation rose 0.3% m/m while the annual rate eased to 2.8%, in line with expectations, even as labor market indicators point to rising stress. Dovish Fed commentary has lifted the probability of a 25 bps rate cut at this week’s meeting to over 85%, supporting bullion sentiment.Gold remains supported amidst steady US yields, falling dollar index and rupee depreciation however, record high prices are weighing on physical demand, influencing jewellers to offer steep discounts.This week remains crucial for markets as multiple high-impact events line up.Alongside speeches from Fed officials, preliminary manufacturing and services PMI data, US jobs numbers, and CPI inflation prints will be closely watched.Together, these releases could significantly influence rate expectations and trigger heightened volatility across asset classes. As these data points are delayed amidst US shutdown, it is important to look at them through a skeptical lens however these data points could trigger volatility and also provide some clarity. Gold prices are well supported at last week's low of ₹1,32,000 any breach below the same could lead to a fall towards the next immediate support of ₹1,30,000. Similarly, resistance band of ₹1,35,000 – 1,36,000 is critical any breach of the same could provide further buying strength in prices. Hence, some dips could be expected continuing last Friday's fall, however, overall bias remains on the higher side.","Gold remains supported amidst steady US yields, falling dollar index and rupee depreciation.

Credit card loans continue to slow,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/credit-card-loans-continue-to-slow/articleshow/125994488.cms,".

Mumbai: Lending through credit cards has come under sharper scrutiny as banks turn cautious amid signs of stress in the segment along with two-wheelers, commercial vehicles and micro loans against property. However, overall retail asset quality remains stable, TransUnion Cibil’s credit data for the Sept quarter showed.“In recent quarters, credit card originations declined while delinquencies rose due to portfolio quality pressures and base effects,” said Bhavesh Jain, MD & CEO of TransUnion Cibil. “In the latest quarter, despite continued degrowth in new cards, portfolio quality has improved following corrective actions.”New credit card originations fell about 15% year on year in the Sept quarter, making cards the only major retail product to remain in contraction even as demand and supply picked up across most other segments. Lenders’ caution reflects their experience over the past year, when rapid growth in unsecured lending was followed by rising defaults. The stress in smaller-ticket and unsecured segments has reinforced a broader shift towards “premiumisation”, with lenders focusing on prime, credit-tested borrowers and higher ticket sizes.","Banks turn cautious amid signs of stress in the segment along with two-wheelers, commercial vehicles and micro loans against property.

"Cars, TVs over clothing, food: FMCG companies yet to see GST gains",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/cars-tvs-over-clothing-food-fmcg-companies-yet-to-see-gst-gains/articleshow/125993565.cms,".

MUMBAI: It has been nearly three months since the new GST rates have kicked in but the fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) sector is yet to see the full impact of the benefits of the tax cuts that drove down prices of a host of essentials.Consumers first rushed to buy durables and cars, where the cuts seemed more appealing given the higher price tags of the products, instead of adding more packs of biscuits and shampoos to their shopping bags. There have been some signs of demand revival, but the extent of the growth will be clear in the coming quarters, said industry executives. In FMCG, a part of the GST benefits (for small packs) has been passed on through grammage increases rather than direct price cuts in many other sectors.FMCG chiefs are divided over the ways in which the cuts will translate into demand. The broader consensus, however, is that the GST reductions should boost consumption as lower tax rates increase affordability, giving consumers more room to premiumise and move to branded products. “FMCG growth in the last 4-5 years have been puzzling for us. With Indian GDP at 7%-8%, one should see FMCG volume growth ahead of GDP growth, but it has been at 4%-5%.One doesn’t know whether the impact of GST is short-term or long-term. The long-term impact will be clear in a few months but in the short-term, we have seen (demand) benefits in categories where reductions have happened,” Sudhir Sitapati, MD & CEO at Godrej Consumer Products and chairman, CII National Committee on FMCG told TOI.The immediate benefit of the GST cuts has gone to categories such as durables and auto, said Saugata Gupta, MD & CEO at Marico, the maker of Saffola oats and Parachute coconut oil. “There the cut was substantial, something moving from 28% to 18%. And the significant outlay that was saved. For FMCG, the benefit will take time,” Gupta said at the CII FMCG summit here on Monday.Weak urban demand has been weighing on FMCG growth—high inflation in the past year nudged consumers in the cities to curb spending, especially in the low to mid-income segments, a key cohort for mass players such as HUL and Dabur. FMCG companies are betting on a mix of GST cuts, income tax benefits and low inflation to spruce up demand.GST cuts have a direct impact on FMCG, said Sudhanshu Vats, MD at Pidilite and co-chairman, CII National Committee on FMCG. “We will see a trajectory uplift as we go forward and this will be a multi-year phenomenon. Demand will come in far more robustly because there’s a job to be done on new category creation, premiumisation, penetration, everything gets a fillip with GST,” Vats said in an interaction.","GST cuts have a direct impact on FMCG, said Sudhanshu Vats, MD at Pidilite.

MGNREGA latest in series of UPA schemes renamed,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/mgnrega-latest-in-series-of-upa-schemes-renamed/articleshow/125993714.cms,"File photo

New Delhi: The govt’s move to replace the rural job guarantee scheme, MGNREGA , with VB-G RAM G is the latest in a series of UPA-era flagship schemes that have been renamed and restructured over the past 11 years. During the Covid-19, the National Food Security Scheme was rebranded as Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY). Similarly, the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana replaced the earlier Indira Awas Yojana; AMRUT became the successor to urban rejuvenation mission JNNURM; and Swachh Bharat Mission replaced Nirmal Gram Yojana.However, the schemes have not undergone just change of nomenclatures. Govt has restructured and expanded the ambit of schemes to make the changes significant and more impactful. “There has been an almost complete overhaul of schemes and programmes. If you consider the PM Awas Yojna, both in rural and urban areas, it’s a mammoth programme compared what the Indira Awas Yojna of 2004 envisaged for rural poor and Rajiv Awas Yojna of 2009 to make cities slum-free,” said a former urban development secretary.PMAY -Urban was launched in April 2016 and the rural segment was rolled out in April 2016 with a combined target to build over four crore houses under the Housing for All programme.The second phase of PMAY has a target to construct three crore additional rural and urban houses.Similarly, govt in 2020 carried out overhauling of National Food Security Scheme launched in Sept 2013, just months before the 2014 LS election, which entitled around 81 crore poor to get subsidised foodgrains of 5 kg per person at Rs 3, Rs 2 and Re 1 a kg for rice, wheat, and coarse grains respectively. During Covid-19 pandemic, Modi govt decided to make the foodgrains available for free. In Nov 2023, govt approved extension of the free foodgrain scheme under PMGKAY for five years till Dec 2029 with an approximate cost of Rs 11.8 lakh crore.One of the most successful flagship schemes of Modi govt, the Swachh Bharat Mission launched in Oct 2014, succeeded the earlier Nirmal Gram Puraskar (NGP) scheme, an incentive for villages achieving 100% sanitation launched in Oct 2003. “But the mission launched in 2014 by PM Modi was of a different scale with a set target to get rid of open defecation, which was achieved within the timeframe. This was the world’s largest behaviour change programme and can’t be compared with an earlier version,” said a former secretary involved in this mission.The other such major transformation of schemes included the National Rural Livelihood Mission of 2011, which was restructured and renamed as Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana — National Rural Livelihood Mission with effect from March 2016, to focus on poverty alleviation by empowering rural poor women through Self-Help Groups (SHGs) and financial access.New nomenclatures also are not just for the sake of renaming but are meant to convey a political message. The new names are in Hindi and their choice seems to be part of PM Modi’s push for de-colonisation or a push against the persisting influence of Macaulay to to fill Indians with a sense of inferiority towards everything non-English.",The National Food Security Scheme was rebranded as Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY) Swachh Bharat Mission succeeded the earlier Nirmal Gram Puraskar (NGP) scheme.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125993702,imgsize-35402,width-400,resizemode-4/screenshot-2025-12-16-080721.jpg"

"India, Canada assess trade pact scope",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/india-canada-assess-trade-pact-scope/articleshow/125993527.cms,".

New Delhi: India and Canada are assessing the scope of the proposed trade deal, factoring in the changed global situation since talks stopped in 2023, commerce secretary Rajesh Agrawal said Monday, while stating that govt is exploring the possibility of a preferential trade agreement with Mexico to help Indian exporters avoid paying steep tariffs of up to 50%.India’s top trade official said that talks were in advanced stages with several trade partners, including New Zealand and the European Union and reiterated that India and the US were “very close” to finalising the framework for their proposed bilateral trade agreement.He said that negotiations between India and the 27-nation bloc have entered the “most difficult” stage, and both sides are engaged to bridge the differences and close the talks soon. “We are in the most difficult stage, most difficult issues are on the table...we are trying to ease that out wherever we are finding a fine balance. There is a set of issues on the table...CBAM is definitely on the table,” he told reporters, adding that EU’s carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM) was also on the discussion table.Elaborating on the tariff increase for 1,455 products by Mexico, targeted at countries with which the American nation does not have a trade deal, Agrawal said that the move will impact around $2 billion of India’s exports, as against the coverage of $3.8 billion when the proposal was first moved a few months ago.“We are trying to see what is a good way forward and it is easier to sign a preferential trade agreement instead of a bilateral agreement (that covers multiple aspects). ”Asked about the talks with Canada, which have been discontinued, as the two countries seek to normalise ties after hostilities seen during Justin Trudeau’s tenure, Agrawal said chief negotiators of India and Canada will hold discussions this week to find a way forward.","India's top trade official said that talks were in advanced stages with several trade partners, including New Zealand and the European Union.

Tata Power in talks to buy out investors in Resurgent,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/tata-power-in-talks-to-buy-out-investors-in-resurgent/articleshow/125993509.cms,".

Bhubaneswar: Tata Power is in discussions to buy out the stakes held by sovereign wealth funds of Oman, Kuwait, and ICICI Ventures in Resurgent Power, which operates a thermal power plant in Uttar Pradesh and two transmission lines in northern India.Collectively, these three investors own 74% of Resurgent, which posted a profit of Rs 613 crore on revenue of Rs 6,004 crore in FY25. “The funds’ nine-year investment cycle in Resurgent is coming to a close. We are in discussions with them to buy their shares in the power platform,” Tata Power MD Praveer Sinha told TOI.The asking valuation for Resurgent, including debt, is around $2 billion. Sinha did not comment on the valuation. Tata Power holds 26% in Resurgent and if the deal is sealed, it will have full ownership of the company, solidifying its position in the sector. Resurgent was established in 2016 by the State General Reserve Fund of Oman, Kuwait Investment Authority, CDP Groupe of Quebec, Canada, and ICICI Ventures to buy distressed power assets in the country.Tata Power later bought a 26% stake in Resurgent, resulting in a change in shareholding with the four investors’ combined holding falling to 74% in the Singapore-registered entity.In 2019, the sovereign wealth funds of Oman and Kuwait bought CDP’s shares in Resurgent, leading to the Canadian pension fund’s exit from the company. Currently, the two Middle Eastern funds together own 64% of Resurgent, while ICICI Ventures holds 10%.Resurgent’s portfolio includes a 75% stake in Prayagraj Power Generation Co, which operates a 1,980 MW coal-fired power plant in Uttar Pradesh, as well as two power transmission companies in northern India. The South East UP Power Transmission Company operates within Uttar Pradesh, and NRSS XXXVI Transmission operates across the states of Uttarakhand, Rajasthan and Haryana.The proposed consolidation at Resurgent will benefit Tata Power as it aims to bid for distribution companies in Uttar Pradesh once the state officially invites bids. “Several states are experiencing financial stress in their distribution businesses, necessitating reforms and private sector participation,” said Sinha, adding that “When opportunities arise, we will participate in the bidding process.” Tata Power has already applied for electricity distribution licenses in Goa and certain areas of Maharashtra.

Ford EV reset: US carmaker scales back electric ambitions after Trump’s policy rollback; forecasts $19.5 bn write-down,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/ford-ev-reset-us-carmaker-scales-back-electric-ambitions-after-trumps-policy-rollback-forecasts-19-5-bn-write-down/articleshow/125993467.cms,"Ford has redrawn its electric vehicle roadmap, announcing that it will pull back from large EVs as the US carmaker transitions towards hybrids, petrol-powered trucks and a new battery storage venture. The auto giant also predicted profits to take a hit of almost $19.5 billion in the next few years.The US automaker, on Monday, said that several large electric models will be dropped, including the F-150 Lightning, as demand has failed to meet expectations amid rising costs and changes in regulation. The decision marks a clear departure from Ford’s earlier EV-heavy ambitions, at a time when the industry is reassessing the pace of the electric transition.“This is a customer-driven shift to create a stronger, more resilient and more profitable Ford,” chief executive Jim Farley said, adding that “the operating reality has changed, and we are redeploying capital into higher-return growth opportunities.”The announcement follows a move by US President Donald Trump to roll back stricter fuel economy rules introduced under former president Joe Biden, which had encouraged US carmakers to accelerate investments in electric vehicles.Farley welcomed the rollback, saying Trump was “aligning fuel economy standards with market realities” and calling it “a win for customers and common sense.”Trump has frequently criticised what he called an EV “mandate”, while Republican lawmakers have also scrapped clean-energy tax credits that had supported EV sales.Going forward, Ford said its electric vehicle development will be limited to smaller, lower-priced models. Production of the current F-150 Lightning has already been stopped, the company said. Its successor will be launched as a hybrid model, pairing an electric battery with a petrol engine and offering a driving range of more than 700 miles.Plans to introduce new electric commercial vans in Europe and North America have also been abandoned. Instead, Ford will produce petrol and hybrid vans at its Ohio assembly plant from 2029. In Tennessee, the company will retool its EV-focused factory, now to be renamed the Tennessee Truck Plant, to build affordable petrol-powered trucks from the same year.As part of its broader reset, Ford is also entering the battery energy storage market. A plant in Kentucky will be converted to manufacture storage systems for data centres and power utilities. The company expects to invest around $2 billion over two years in the project and aims to reach an annual capacity of 20 gigawatt-hours by late 2027, positioning itself as a significant player in the fast-growing sector.",The US automaker said that several large electric models will be dropped.

US President Donald Trump’s $100,000 price tag for new H-1B workers hired from outside the US will have punishing effects for the IT outsourcing and staffing industries that have long been a target of both parties.The fee is the biggest restriction the Trump administration has imposed so far on employment of skilled foreign workers.A Bloomberg analysis found it will have a disproportionate impact on multinational staffing firms that act as middlemen for companies seeking H-1B workers. Those middlemen include TCS Infosys , and Cognizant.Almost 90% of new H-1B hires at those three companies between May 2020 and May 2024 were approved at US consulates. The workers would have cost each of them hundreds of millions more if the fee had been in effect.More than 93% of new Infosys H-1B hires in that timeframe — upwards of 10,400 workers — would have been hit with the $100,000 fee, the Bloomberg analysis showed, adding up to more than a billion dollars in visa charges.TCS would have had to pay the fee for 6,500 workers over that period, or 82% of newly approved H-1B workers. Cognizant would be faced with the charge for more than 5,600 employees, or 89% of new H-1B hires.Even if legal challenges are successful in quickly blocking the fee, industry observers expect it will to lead to a steep drop in visa demand and drive placement of more workers overseas.Large tech and IT firms have traditionally dominated the H-1B programme, the primary pathway to US careers for foreign workers with at least a bachelor’s degree. They claim most of the 85,000 visa slots available each year.Both Republican and Democratic lawmakers have claimed that companies use the programme as a cheap alternative to American workers, although H-1B employees must be paid a “prevailing wage” for their industry and early-career H-1B workers typically garner well above the US median wage.Workers from outside the US, rather than recent international graduates of US colleges already in the country, accounted for more than four out of 10 new H-1B hires approved over the past four years, data analysed by Bloomberg showed.",The fee is the biggest restriction the Trump administration has imposed so far on employment of skilled foreign workers.

Mercosur hurdle: French objections and farm protests freeze EU trade deal; Brussels faces credibility test,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/mercosur-hurdle-french-objections-and-farm-protests-freeze-eu-trade-deal-brussels-faces-credibility-test/articleshow/125988255.cms,"Photo credit - AP

France’s last-minute opposition and mounting farmer protests are threatening to derail the European Union’s long-delayed free-trade agreement with South America’s Mercosur bloc, raising fresh doubts over whether the pact can be signed this year, AP reported.Angry European farmers, fearing cheaper agricultural imports and tougher competition, have taken to the streets in Brussels just as EU negotiators were hoping to close a deal that has taken nearly 25 years to negotiate. The agreement involves the 27-country EU and five Mercosur nations — Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay and Bolivia — and would gradually remove duties on most goods traded between the two blocs over 15 years.The accord, agreed in principle a year ago, still needs approval from all EU member states and the European Parliament. EU officials had planned for European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and European Council President António Costa to sign the deal in Brazil on December 20, but growing resistance now threatens that timeline.French Prime Minister Sébastien Lecornu said on Sunday that the current deal was “unacceptable” and that the “conditions have not been met” for EU leaders to authorise its signing this week, effectively seeking a delay that could push the decision to 2026 or later.While acknowledging steps taken by the European Commission to protect farmers and tighten food safety checks, Lecornu said France remained unconvinced.Poland, Austria, the Netherlands and France fear Mercosur exporters could undercut EU farmers who operate under stricter labour, environmental and sanitary rules, including pesticide restrictions, analysts told AP. France has been pressing for “mirror clauses” that would require Mercosur producers to meet the same standards — demands that have not been fully accepted.Alicia Gracia-Herrero, a senior fellow at the Brussels-based Bruegel Institute, said the standoff exposed limits to the EU’s political unity and global influence. “If we cannot get this done even with (US President Donald) Trump’s pressure, what can you expect from the EU?” she said, warning that further delays could undermine Brussels’ credibility in talks with partners such as Indonesia and India.The deal comes at a sensitive time for the EU, which has been seeking to diversify trade ties after Trump imposed tariffs of 15% on most EU imports earlier this year, AP reported. Brussels sees the Mercosur pact as a strategic counterweight to aggressive trade tactics by both the US and China.European Commission spokesperson Olof Gill said the bloc is pushing to conclude the agreement by year-end, arguing it would strengthen the EU’s geopolitical standing. “We’re talking about bringing together two of the world’s biggest trading blocs,” he said, citing cooperation on climate, economic security and reform of the global rules-based order.Agriculture remains central to the dispute. The EU exported 235.4 billion euros ($272 billion) worth of agricultural goods in 2024, and critics warn the deal could hurt local dairy and beef producers and cause environmental damage. Supporters counter that it would save businesses about $4.26 billion in duties annually and open markets for products ranging from French wine to German pharmaceuticals and Brazilian minerals.To calm opposition, the European Commission has proposed safeguards, including mechanisms allowing farmers to trigger investigations if Mercosur imports are priced at least 10% below EU products, tighter border inspections for banned pesticides, and reforms to distribute agricultural subsidies more equitably.These measures, however, have failed to ease French concerns or quell farmer anger. Agricultural unions are again planning demonstrations in Brussels as EU leaders meet later this week, underlining the political risks surrounding a deal that was once seen as a cornerstone of the bloc’s trade strategy.",France's last-minute opposition and mounting farmer protests are threatening to derail the European Union's long-delayed free-trade agreement with South America's Mercosur bloc.

‘Trump’s tariffs pushing India away’: Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal warns US may lose trade ally to Russia and China,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/trumps-tariffs-pushing-india-away-congresswoman-pramila-jayapal-warns-us-may-lose-trade-ally-to-russia-and-china/articleshow/125982593.cms,"‘Damaging India, Hurting America’: Jayapal Flags Tariff Crisis Hitting Both Nations

Indian-origin Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal criticised President Trump’s tariffs on Indian goods, saying they are raising prices for Americans and also pushing India closer to other global powers.In a post on X, Jayapal said, “Trump’s tariffs on India aren’t only raising prices for Americans — they are pushing India away as a trading ally and giving the country more incentive to partner with Russia and China. That hurts our economy and makes us all less safe.”During a congressional hearing, Jayapal questioned expert witness Sameer Lalwani about the impact of these tariffs and how India could feel its neighbouring countries, Pakistan and Bangladesh, have lower tariffs.She said, “In August, President Trump doubled tariffs on many Indian goods to 50%. How concerned is India over the fact that its neighbors, Pakistan and Bangladesh, have secured lower tariff rates than India, while India continues to actively negotiate? And how could the perception that the U.S. is no longer a reliable partner impact India’s relationship with BRICS and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization?”Lalwani responded that the tariffs are a significant concern for India, limiting export potential and increasing costs.He warned that the measures could push India closer to BRICS and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, running counter to the intended goals of the tariffs.Since August, Trump’s trade policy has raised duties on Indian imports, including textiles, gems, leather, and seafood, in some cases up to 50%. Indian officials and industry groups warn that these high tariffs could sharply reduce exports to the US, India’s largest export market, putting jobs in labour-intensive sectors at risk.","Since August, Trump’s trade policy has raised duties on Indian imports, including textiles, gems, leather, and seafood, in some cases up to 50%.

China’s $1 trillion trade surplus! Winning on the export front — how is Beijing dealing with Trump’s tariff hit,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/chinas-1-trillion-trade-surplus-winning-on-the-export-front-how-is-beijing-dealing-with-trumps-tariff-hit/articleshow/125969701.cms,"How China is surviving Trump’s tariff hit





Beijing's 'irresistible appeal' to the world — but how long will it last?



How are things back home



China posted an unprecedented $1 trillion trade surplus in the first 11 months of the year, brushing aside steep tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump and highlighting deep global appetite for low-cost Chinese goods.The record surplus comes a year after Chinese manufacturers rushed to ship goods abroad after Trump’s election victory, in predicting a renewed trade war. That fears materialised when Trump imposed heavy tariffs on Chinese imports to tackle America’s widening trade deficit.Yet instead of shrinking, China’s export machine accelerated.According to customs data cited by CNN, world's second largest economy recorded exports rising 5.7% year-on-year for the period between January and November. Meanwhile shipments to the United States fell sharply by 18.3% as exporters redirected goods to other regions. As a result outflows to Europe rose 8.9%, those to Southeast Asia jumped 14.6% and for Africa, the figure surged to 27.2% over the same period.The scale of the export rebound has reinforced Beijing’s belief that reliance on the US market can be reduced. It has also strengthened President Xi Jinping’s resolve to maintain a firm stance in trade negotiations with Washington.Although Trump and Xi agreed to ease tensions during talks in October, and both sides returned to a fragile truce, a comprehensive trade agreement has yet to emerge.Chinese exporters leaned heavily on strategies refined during Trump’s first term, shifting supply chains, rerouting shipments and aggressively expanding into markets where demand for cheaper goods remains strong. This approach, driven largely by companies rather than central directives, has allowed China to absorb the impact of US tariffs.At the same time, the export boom has been fuelled by structural pressures within China’s economy. Weak domestic demand and muted consumer confidence have pushed manufacturers to seek growth overseas. Imports, often seen as a proxy for internal consumption, rose just 0.2% in the first 11 months of the year.China’s dominance as the world’s manufacturing hub has made this export pivot possible. Years of heavy investment under Xi’s “Made in China 2025” strategy have expanded production capacity across both traditional and high-tech sectors. According to Nomura, China’s exports have climbed nearly 45% over the past five years, helped by a surge in global demand during the pandemic.However, that investment has also created widespread overcapacity, intensifying price competition at home and forcing firms to look abroad. In many developing economies, dependence on Chinese components and finished goods has continued to grow as competitors struggle to match China’s scale and pricing.Wang Jun, deputy head of the General Administration of Customs, said China’s trade performance reflected the strength of its industrial supply chain, the momentum of higher-tech industries and the resolve of exporters operating under pressure.Hu Xijin, former editor-in-chief of the Global Times, supported the view in a social media post.“The competitiveness of Chinese products cannot be wiped out by trade protectionism. Their quality and low prices offer an irresistible appeal, and market forces determine that China’s supply chain is unmatched in today’s world,” he wrote.Economists, however, have warned that some of the export growth may be overstated due to transshipments, goods routed through countries such as those in Southeast Asia for further processing before being re-exported to the US. While difficult to quantify, such practices have complicated tariff enforcement, even as Washington imposed additional levies and negotiated transshipment agreements with countries including Vietnam.Concerns are also mounting over whether China can sustain such rapid export expansion. While many analysts expect exports to remain resilient next year, the pace of growth is expected to slow.Zichun Huang, China economist at Capital Economics, said in a research note on Monday that China’s trade surplus is likely to widen further next year as rerouted trade supports exports while imports weaken amid soft domestic demand, CNN reported.China’s export surge has also heightened trade tensions beyond the US. Governments across the European Union, India and Brazil have raised concerns over Chinese “dumping”. The EU has already imposed tariffs and anti-dumping measures on Chinese electric vehicles and other products.During a visit to China last week, French President Emmanuel Macron described trade imbalances between Europe and China as “unbearable”, later warning in an interview with a French newspaper that additional tariffs could be imposed.Economic vulnerabilities persist in China. The property sector has been in decline for five years, eroding household wealth and curbing spending. Youth unemployment remains elevated, and limited social security coverage continues to restrain consumption.Deflationary pressures have also weighed on the economy throughout much of the year, driven by overcapacity and intense price wars in sectors including electric vehicles, e-commerce and construction materials. The competition became so fierce that authorities intervened to rein in manufacturers, though economists say deflation is unlikely to ease soon.With Beijing reluctant to deploy a major stimulus package, exports have become a critical support for growth.China’s Central Economic Work Conference, which concluded on Thursday, acknowledged the challenges ahead. An official statement said the economy faces “old problems and new challenges”.“The impact of changing external environment is intensifying, and there’s a noticeable contradiction between strong supply and weak demand domestically, along with significant risks in key areas,” it said, as cited by CNN.The government said a “more proactive fiscal policy” and a “moderately loose monetary policy” would continue next year.China is also preparing its next five-year economic plan, due to be released in March. Officials indicated at an October Communist Party meeting that priorities will include strengthening China’s “economic strength, scientific and technological capabilities, national defense strength” and accelerating development in “manufacturing, product quality, aerospace, transportation, and cyberspace.”",China posted an unprecedented $1 trillion trade surplus in the first 11 months of the year.

The figures missed Bloomberg's estimate, that had projected sales growth to hold steady at 2.9%, similar to October.Factory output also softened, with industrial production expanding 4.8% in November, missing Reuter's estimate of a 5% rise. A month earlier, the figures stood at 4.9%.Investment activity also remained under pressure, as fixed-asset investment declined 2.6% in the first 11 months of the year amid a continued collapse in property investment, according to Bloomberg. The urban unemployment rate was unchanged at 5.1%, indicating little improvement in labour market conditions.Annual car sales also plunged to 8.5% in November, marking the steepest decline in 10 months. The figures came as a disappointment to an industry that usually sees a strong sales in the last two months of a year, Reuters reported. It further added that even after the Singles' Day Shopping festival stretched across five weeks this year, failed to woo customers.China’s difficulty in reviving domestic consumption is making the economy more exposed to external risks. In recent months, growth has relied largely on overseas demand, even as the tariff war launched by US President Donald Trump continues to reshape global trade.At home, weak demand from consumers and businesses has dragged on the world’s second-largest economy for years, leading to deflation that has hit profits and wages. Recent trends, according to Bloomberg, point towards further headwinds, with loan growth slowing and investment registering a sharp and unexplained drop in recent months.These concerns were reflected in last week’s high-level economic meetings, where China’s leadership placed the expansion of domestic demand at the top of the agenda for the year ahead, citing uncertainty in foreign trade. While officials reaffirmed their intention to keep growth-supportive policies in place, they stopped short of signalling any immediate, forceful intervention.","Retail sales increased by only 1.3% from a year earlier, marking the slowest growth since the Covid period.

As the new year approaches, a clear theme is emerging on Wall Street, the technology giants that powered the bull market may no longer dominate market gains.Strategists at firms such as Bank of America and Morgan Stanley are advising clients to look beyond the so-called Magnificent Seven, a group that includes Nvidia and Amazon and shift toward less popular sectors. Health care, industrials and energy are now among the preferred picks for 2026, Bloomberg reported.For years, Big Tech stocks were seen as a safe bet, backed by strong balance sheets and robust profits. But doubts are growing over whether the sector can continue to justify its high valuations and heavy spending on artificial intelligence.Tech stocks have surged nearly 300% since the bull market began three years ago, but recent earnings from AI-linked firms Oracle and Broadcom, which fell short of lofty expectations, have added to investor unease.At the same time, optimism around the broader US economy is building, encouraging investors to rotate into lagging segments of the S&P 500 at the expense of megacap tech. ""I’m hearing about people taking money out of the Magnificent Seven trade, and they’re going elsewhere in the market,"" Craig Johnson, chief market technician at Piper Sandler & Co told Bloomberg.""They’re not just going to be chasing the Microsofts and Amazons anymore, they’re going to be broadening this trade out,"" Johnson added.Signs of this shift are already visible. Investors are moving into undervalued cyclical stocks, small caps and economically sensitive sectors.Since US equities hit a near-term low on November 20, the small-cap Russell 2000 Index has risen 11%, while a Bloomberg gauge of the Magnificent Seven has gained roughly half that amount. Over the same period, the S&P 500 Equal Weight Index has outperformed the traditional, market-cap-weighted index.Strategas Asset Management expects this trend to continue. Chairman Jason De Sena Trennert said the firm sees a ""great sector rotation"" into this year’s underperformers, such as financials and consumer discretionary stocks, in 2026. Morgan Stanley’s research team echoed that view in its year-ahead outlook.""We think Big Tech can still do OK but will lag these new areas, most notably consumer discretionary, especially goods and small- and mid-caps,"" Michael Wilson, Morgan Stanley’s chief US equity strategist and chief investment officer told Bloomberg.Wilson said the broadening of market leadership could be supported by an ""early-cycle backdrop,"" following an economic trough in April. Such phases typically benefit cyclical sectors like financials and industrials.Bank of America’s Michael Hartnett said markets are already positioning for a ""run-it-hot"" strategy in 2026, rotating into "" Main Street"" mid caps, small caps and micro caps from Wall Street megacaps.Fundamentals appear to support the case for a broader rally. Earnings growth for the S&P 493, the index excluding the seven largest companies, is expected to rise to 9% in 2026 from 7% this year. Meanwhile, the earnings share of the top seven firms is projected to fall to 46% from 50%, according to Goldman Sachs.Still, some investors want more proof. Michael Bailey, director of research at FBB Capital Partners, said investors will look for confirmation that the S&P 493 can meet or beat earnings expectations.""If jobs and inflation data remain status quo and the Federal Reserve is still easing, we could see a bullish move in the 493 next year,"" he said. The Federal Reserve cut interest rates for the third straight time this week and signaled another reduction next year.","Investors are moving into undervalued cyclical stocks, small caps and economically sensitive sectors.

"High-end car sales sink in China as its economy slows, taking a toll on European automakers",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/high-end-car-sales-sink-in-china-as-its-economy-slows-taking-a-toll-on-european-automakers/articleshow/125957975.cms,"'No Free Lift For India': PM Modi's Chief Economic Adviser Says China Won’t Repeat West’s Mistake

Chinese demand for foreign luxury cars is waning as customers opt for more affordable Chinese brand models, often sold at big discounts, catering to their taste for fancy electronics and comfort.That is bad news for European carmakers like Porsche, Aston Martin, Mercedes-Benz and BMW that have long dominated the upper reaches of the world's largest auto market.A slowing economy hits the luxury market A prolonged property downturn in China has left many consumers with little appetite for big purchases. Meanwhile, the well-to-do are becoming increasingly shy about publicly displaying their wealth, said Paul Gong, UBS head of China Automotive Industry Research.Many car buyers have been swayed by a 20,000 yuan ($2,830) trade-in subsidy offered by the Chinese government for purchasing electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles. People tended to purchase cheaper, entry-level cars where the discount will count more and those cars are mostly Chinese made, Gong said.""Slowing economic growth is one key driver behind weaker demand for premium cars,"" said Claire Yuan, director of corporate ratings for China autos at S&P Global Ratings, referring to a segment that typically counts car brands such as Mercedes-Benz and BMW.The market share of premium car sales in China, usually priced above 300,000 yuan ($42,400), more than doubled between 2017 and 2023 to about 15% of total sales, S&P said.That trend is now reversing. The share of premium cars sales fell to 14% in 2024 and to 13% in the first nine months of 2025, S&P said.Chinese automakers take a bigger bite While luxury auto sales have slowed, Chinese manufacturers, including electric vehicle maker BYD, have become more aggressive than many Western brands in technological innovation, frequently rolling out new electric vehicles and hybrids at cheaper prices, including premium vehicles, analysts said.""Their (Chinese carmakers') products are more competitive and more affordable even in the premium segment,"" Yuan said. ""That's why these foreign brands are gradually losing momentum.""The Chinese brands' share of passenger car sales climbed to almost 70% in the first 11 months of this year, according to China Association of Automobile Manufacturers. It reported Thursday that German brands held a 12% share, Japanese brands around 10% and U.S. brands nearly 6%.BYD already has overtaken Volkswagen as the biggest car seller in China in recent years. BYD is so far the best selling car brand this year in China for ""new energy vehicles,"" which include electric vehicles and hybrids, according to the China Passenger Car Association. BYD had cut prices of its electric and plug-in hybrid models by up to 34%, putting pressure on major rivals like Geely and Leapmotor.Mercedes-Benz's sales by units in China fell 27% from a year earlier in the July-September quarter, according to its latest earning report. The number of BMWs and its subsidiary-brand Minis sold in China dropped 11.2% year-on-year in the first nine months of 2025. Porsche and Aston Martin also cited pressure from weaker demand in China.Italian luxury carmaker Ferrari reported a 13% year-on-year drop in car shipments to mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan in January-September. It was the only region where sales declined during that time.Ola Kallenius, CEO of Mercedes-Benz, told investors in late October that ""hyper-competition in China is not going away anytime soon.""The ""market situation in the premium and luxury segment in China remained tense,"" the carmaker said.Used luxury cars going for cheaper The downturn in interest in luxury vehicles is hitting dealerships hard.Li Yi, a salesperson in charge of second-hand cars at a Beijing Porsche center, said a 2024 Panamera 2.9T with a mileage of about 20,000 kilometers (12,400 miles) was priced at 950,000 yuan ($134,300). The previous owner bought it for about 1.4 million yuan ($198,454).""It's mainly due to the sluggish economic situation,"" Li said. ""(It's) not only Porsche. Benz, BMW, Bentley and Rolls-Royce all face the same situation."" Porsche and Bentley are part of the Volkswagen group.At a used-car market in Beijing, four other car dealership representatives who spoke to The Associated Press described a similarly grim situation, with premium cars selling at significantly lower prices over the past year.China's monthly auto production in November surpassed a record of 3.5 million units for the first time, the CAAM reported Thursday, but domestic auto sales dropped 4% year-on-year under fading demand as some trade-in subsidies were halted in some regions.""Who still has money these days? People's pockets are cleaner than their faces,"" joked one used car salesperson who identified herself as Hao.Prices have been sliding for two years and she offers bigger discounts, said the salesperson, who did not give her full name as she was not authorized by her company to speak to the media.""Now they think hard before they spend,"" she said.","Chinese demand for foreign luxury cars waning as customers opt for more affordable Chinese brand models.

In a light-filled workshop in eastern China, a robotic arm moved a partially assembled autonomous vehicle as workers calibrated its cameras, typical of the incremental automation being adopted even across smaller factories in the world's manufacturing powerhouse.China is already the world's largest market for industrial robots, and the government is pouring billions of dollars into robotics and artificial intelligence to boost its presence in the sector.The first essentially humanlessfactoriesare already in operation, even as widespread automation raises questions about job losses as well as the cost and difficulty of transition for smaller and medium-sized companies.The answer for many is a hybrid approach, experts and factory owners told AFP.At the autonomous vehicle workshop, manager Liu Jingyao told AFP that humans are still a crucial part of even technologically advanced manufacturing.""Many decisions require human judgement,"" said Liu, whose company Neolix produces small van-like vehicles that transport parcels across Chinese cities.""These decisions involve certain skill-based elements that still need to be handled by people.""At the Neolix factory, 300 kilometres (186 miles) north of Shanghai, newly built driverless vehicles zoomed around a testing track simulating obstacles including puddles and bridges.In a closed-off room, workers assembled vehicles' ""brains"", testing their cameras and computer chips.""Automation... primarily serve(s) to assist humans, reducing labour intensity rather than replacing them,"" Liu said.But Ni Jun, a mechanical engineering expert at Shanghai's Jiaotong University, said China's strategy of focusing on industrial applications for AI means full automation is already feasible in many sectors.Among others, tech giant Xiaomi operates a ""dark factory"" -- where the absence of people means no need for lights -- with robotic arms and sensors able to make smartphones without humans.- Digital divide -Ni described a ""digital divide"" between larger companies with the funds to invest heavily in modernisation, and smaller businesses struggling to keep up.For Zhu Yefeng's Far East Precision Printing Company, part of China's vast network of small independent factories employing up to a few dozen people each, full automation is a distant dream.At the company just outside Shanghai, workers in small rooms fed sheets of instruction manuals into folding machines and operated equipment that printed labels for electronic devices.The company used pen and paper to track its workflow until two years ago, with managers having to run around the factory to communicate order information.""Things were, to put it bluntly, a complete mess,"" Zhu told AFP.The company has since adopted software that allows employees to scan QR codes that send updates to a factory-wide tracker.On a screen in his office, Zhu can see detailed charts breaking down each order's completion level and individual employees' productivity statistics.""This is a start,"" Zhu told AFP. ""We will move toward more advanced technology like automation, in order to receive even bigger orders from clients.""Financial constraints are a major barrier though.""As a small company, we can't afford certain expenses,"" said Zhu.His team is trying to develop its own robotic quality testing machine, but for now humans continue to check final products.- Employment pressures -The potential unemployment caused by widespread automation will be a challenge, said Jacob Gunter from the Berlin-based Mercator Institute for China Studies.""Companies will be quite happy to decrease their headcount... but the government will not like that and will be under a lot of pressure to navigate this,"" Gunter told AFP.Beijing's push to develop industrial robots will ""intersect with the need for maintaining high employment at a time when employment pressure is considerable"", he added.Going forward, manufacturers must strike a balance ""between the technical feasibility, social responsibility, and business necessity"", Jiaotong University's Ni told AFP.Zhou Yuxiang, the CEO of Black Lake Technologies -- the start-up that provided the software for Zhu's factory -- told AFP he thought factories would ""always be hybrid"".""If you ask every owner of a factory, is a dark factory the goal? No, that's just a superficial description,"" Zhou said. ""The goal for factories is to optimise production, deliver things that their end customers want, and also make money.""",China is already the world's largest market for industrial robots.

Venezuela's oil exports shrivel as US seizes tanker off its coast,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/venezuelas-oil-exports-shrivel-as-us-seizes-tanker-off-its-coast/articleshow/125951065.cms,"China, Russia SLAM Trump After U.S. Military 'HIJACKS' Oil Vessel Off Venezuela

CARACAS: Venezuela's oil exports have plummeted since the US seized an oil tanker off the country's coast this week and imposed new sanctions on shipping companies doing business with the embattled Latin American country, Al Jazeera reported.Oil tanker movements into and out of Venezuelan waters have almost come to a standstill, Al Jazeera's sources stated, after the US announced that it would seize more vessels as part of its military pressure on Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro.The seizure on Wednesday of the Skipper tanker marked the first US capture of Venezuelan oil cargo since Washington imposed sanctions on Caracas in 2019. It also comes amid a US military build-up in the Caribbean, which appears designed to remove Maduro from power.Threats of more seizures have now left tankers - loaded with about 11 million barrels of oil and fuel - stuck in Venezuelan waters and fearing to venture further, according to data and documents cited by Al Jazeera's sources.Only tankers chartered by US oil giant Chevron have left ports and sailed into international waters carrying Venezuelan crude since the seizure of the Skipper, according to Reuters. Chevron has US government authorisation to operate in Venezuela through joint ventures with state-run oil company PDVSA and can export its oil to the US.Chevron confirmed this week that it was operating in Venezuela ""without disruption and in full compliance with laws and regulations applicable,"" and had exported two cargoes of Venezuelan heavy crude to the US since the seizure of the Skipper.As the Skipper was taken to Houston, Texas, on Friday for the unloading of its confiscated fuel cargo, Trump reiterated that the US military will start carrying out strikes on land against drug trafficking targets in Latin America, as per Al Jazeera.Speaking at the White House, Trump said that US forces - which have been attacking vessels in the Caribbean Sea and Pacific Ocean for weeks, killing some 90 people - had stopped 96 percent of drugs trafficked to the US by water.The US also claims it is attacking drug trafficking vessels but has provided no evidence, while international law experts say the attacks amount to extrajudicial killings by Washington in international waters.","Venezuela's oil exports have plummeted since the US seized an oil tanker off the country's coast this week.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor (CEA) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas.

How India's GDP has been growing

What SBI report said on savings and investment

Incremental capital output ratio

NEW DELHI: India's gross domestic product (GDP) data for the third quarter (October-December 2022) received a word of caution from the former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan In an interview with news agency PTI, Rajan that India is ""dangerously close"" to the Hindu rate of growth in view of subdued private sector investment, high interest rates and slowing global growth.India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying"".However, a report released by the State Bank of India (SBI) economists on Tuesday dismissed arguments that India is dangerously close to Hindu rate of growth saying such statements are ""ill-conceived, biased and premature"".The term 'Hindu growth rate' was coined by late economist Raj Krishna in 1978 to describe the slow growth in the country.It basically refers to the low pace of economic growth rates during 1950s to 1980s. During this period, the Indian economy averaged 3.5%.A former lecturer at the Delhi School of Economics (DSE), Krishna noted that only if the rate of growth is persistently slow and accompanied by low per-capita GDP, then it will be known as Hindu rate of growth but it has to factor in population growth as well.Before economic reforms of 1991, India's economic growth remained stagnant and low, while per capita income averaged around 1.3%.Krishna termed this low growth situation to be a result of socialist policies of state control and import substitution.However, the economic situation changed when liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation (LPG) reforms came into effect in the year 1991, at a time when India faced balance of payment crisis.Over the years, many economists have strongly opposed the idea of 'Hindu growth rate' and the term never had universal acceptance.The Indian economy plunged into its very first technical recession in FY21 due to the impact of Covid-19 pandemic and the related nationwide lockdowns. GDP shrunk by an unprecedented 23.8% in the first quarter of the financial year 2020-21. However, due to spurt in economic activities in the subsequent quarters, the GDP decline started to narrow.However, if we look at the period before Covid-19 as well, India's growth curve shows a declining trend.From 8.26% in FY17, GDP growth plunged to 3.74% in FY20. Shutdown of economic activities in FY21 in wake of Covid-19 only made matters worse.As lockdowns started to ease and business activities resumed, India's GDP also started rising. In Q1 of FY22, growth jumped to 20.1% mainly on account of low base effect. By the fourth quarter of FY22, growth came down to 4.10%.Similarly, the new financial year 2022-23 brought fresh economic challenges in the form of Russia-Ukraine war that impacted almost all major economies of the world, slowed the pace of growth, pushed inflation to record highs.As a result, the central banks of all advanced economies spurred into action and opted for monetary policy tightening to curb the soaring inflation.With persistently rising interest rates, India's economy grew by 4.4% in Q3 of FY23, as the Centre revised upwards GDP growth for previous year to 9.10% from 8.7% earlier.The report weighed recent GDP numbers against the available data on savings and investments for the past decade and highlighted some interesting points.""Quarterly growth numbers are noisy and should be best avoided for any serious interpretation (on an average, India's GDP growth has witnessed Rs 2 lakh crore upward revision for the 3 year ended FY23),"" the report said.Gross capital formation (GCF) by the government touched a high of 11.8% in 2021-22, up from 10.7% in 2020-21.""This also had a domino effect on private sector investment that jumped from 10 per cent to 10.8% over the same period,"" it said.In fact, Ecowrap added that the trends in GCF to gross output ratio or the plough back of funds for creation of fresh capacity shows that for public administration the ratio attained fresh peak in 2021-22 owing to the emphasis on capital expenditure in recent budgets.At the aggregate level, gross capital formation is supposed to have crossed 32% in 2022-23, the highest level since 2018-19.According to the report, in 2021-22, gross savings have risen to 30% from 29% in 2020-21.""The ratio is supposed to have crossed 31 per cent in 2022-23, the highest since 2018-19. The household savings increased sharply during the pandemic period on account of sharp accretion in financial savings such as deposits,"" said the report by SBI's Economic Research Department.While household financial savings have since then moderated from 15.4% in 2020-21 to 11.1% in 2022-23, savings in physical assets have grown sharply to 11.8% in 2021-22 from 10.7% in 2020-21.The report further analysed Incremental Capital Output ratio (ICOR) -- which measures additional units of capital (investment) needed to produce additional units of output. It said that the ratio has been improving.""ICOR which was 7.5 in FY 12 is now only 3.5 in FY22. Clearly, only half of capital is now needed for next unit of output,"" the report noted.Such reducing ICOR in the current years reflects a relatively increasing efficiency of capital and shows that the economy is on a sound footing, the report said.""From that point of view, future GDP growth rates even at 7% could still mean a decent number by any standards!,"" it added.","India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.

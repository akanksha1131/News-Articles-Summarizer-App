Stock market recommendations:Bharti Airtel's FCF generation has surged to INR292b in 9MFY25, driven by tariff hikes and reduced capex post-5G rollout. The company has prepaid ~INR670b in high-cost spectrum debt since FY22, improving leverage. With FY25-27 FCF expected to reach ~INR500b annually, capital allocation becomes a key focus. Bharti's revenue/EBITDA is projected to grow at a 15%/19% CAGR over FY24-27, supported by tariff hikes and Indus consolidation. Key monitorables include FCF deployment and potential AGR relief.Management expects double-digit revenue growth in FY25, supported by strong demand from weddings, tourism, and MICE events. ARR and occupancy remain robust. The company’s expansion into spiritual tourism aligns with the government’s push to develop 50 key tourist destinations, with IH planning over 2,800 new rooms across Ayodhya, Hampi, Vrindavan, Ujjain, Prayagraj, and Makkah in the next three to five years. A healthy room addition pipeline, favorable demand-supply trends, and govt support for tourism position IH well for sustained growth. We expect revenue/EBITDA/adj. PAT to grow 31%/34%/26% YoY.","According to Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd, the top stock picks for the week (starting March 10, 2025) are Bharti Airtel and Indian Hotels.

Golden Visa Benefits:

In today's uncertain and dynamic global environment, affluent individuals seek alternative arrangements for themselves and their loved ones - arrangements that provide secure havens during turbulent times whilst enabling enhanced access to worldwide commercial and lifestyle prospects.

Golden visas serve as strategic tools for affluent individuals seeking to safeguard their wealth and enhance their global mobility. These programmes are said to offer a reliable safeguard against economic and political uncertainties in an unstable global environment.

The golden visa scheme enables high net worth persons to establish residence in financially advantageous jurisdictions whilst securing comprehensive residential rights, including access to employment, educational institutions and healthcare facilities in the host country.

Some Available Golden Visa Programmes for Indians

According to an ET report, despite tightening regulations, Indian applicants can still access several golden visa schemes:

Portugal continues to offer residency through investments in qualified funds, scientific research initiatives, or business expansion projects.

Greece has adjusted its programme, raising the real estate investment threshold to €400,000, whilst offering a €250,000 alternative route through local startup investments.

Spain's scheme remains accessible to investors who submitted applications prior to 2024, despite plans to discontinue the programme.

Malta maintains its citizenship by investment option, subject to thorough background checks.

Various Caribbean nations, including St. Kitts and Nevis, Grenada, Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica, and Saint Lucia, provide passports for investments beginning at $200,000.

The UAE golden visa programme continues to welcome Indian investors and professionals from essential sectors, including healthcare, technology, and business.

Singapore's Global Investor Program, whilst not technically a golden visa, enables permanent residency through substantial local business investments.

Golden visa programmes: Countries around the world are strengthening restrictions on unauthorised immigration, whilst maintaining pathways for investment-based residency. Investment visa schemes provide opportunities to obtain residential status or nationality through monetary commitments. Although traditionally popular amongst Chinese, Russian and Middle Eastern investors, these programmes now draw applicants from across the globe.Golden visas allow for investment-linked residency on a temporary or permanent basis. These are linked to applicants making qualifying financial contributions, including property acquisition, enterprise establishment or state fund deposits. The flexible residency requirements of certain programmes appeal to those seeking alternative options whilst retaining freedom of movement.A golden visa programme is a legal pathway where qualified individuals receive residential privileges in a country by making specified financial investments. This differs from citizenship-by-investment schemes, which provide complete citizenship benefits. Through golden visas, wealthy individuals can obtain legal residency status, allowing them to live, pursue employment, education and access healthcare services in their chosen nation.Nations increasingly provide residence and citizenship through investment schemes such as golden visa programmes, featuring diverse investment choices tailored to individual family needs.Golden passports provide ""citizenship by investment”. They deliver comprehensive citizenship privileges, frequently including admission to regional economic zones. Within the European Union, Malta's scheme enables investors to live, work and pursue education across all EU member states. In the Caribbean region, nations including St. Kitts and Nevis, Antigua and Barbuda, and Grenada provide competitive options beginning at approximately $200,000.US President Donald Trump has introduced the ""gold card"" scheme as a replacement for the existing EB-5 visa system. This initiative would grant residency rights and citizenship prospects in exchange for a $5 million investment. Unlike the current EB-5 programme, the proposed scheme suggests direct payment to the US government to address national debt. This arrangement could present an alternative solution for Indian investors facing extensive waiting periods in the current employment-based green card system.",Golden visas allow for investment-linked residency on a temporary or permanent basis.

"Some relief! Average cost of preparing vegetarian thali at home goes down in February, but chicken plays spoilsport for non-vegetarians",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/some-relief-average-cost-of-preparing-vegetarian-thali-at-home-goes-down-in-february-but-chicken-plays-spoilsport-for-non-vegetarians/articleshow/118834280.cms,"Vegetarian thali cost saw a 1% reduction year-on-year in February.

In February, the vegetarian thali saw a reduction in cost compared to the previous year, whilst the non-vegetarian thali showed an increase due to higher broiler prices.

The vegetarian thali saw a 1% reduction year-on-year in February, whereas the non-vegetarian thali registered an increase of approximately 6%:

The reduction in vegetarian thali cost was attributed to decreased prices of tomato and LPG cylinder

was attributed to decreased prices of tomato and LPG cylinder Tomato prices reduced to Rs 23/kg from Rs 32/kg, showing a 28% decrease year-on-year, due to 20% increased supply

LPG costs decreased by 11% year-on-year (to Rs 803 per 14.2 kg cylinder in Delhi from Rs 903) providing additional savings

The decline would have been more substantial if not for the increased prices of onion (11%), potato (16%) and vegetable oil (18%) year-on-year, says CRISIL.

In some relief for the common man, the cost of a home-cooked vegetarian thali declined year-on-year in February, according to CRISIL’s latest monthly indicator of food plate cost, RRR (Roti Rice Rate). The cost of a non-vegetarian thali, however grew approximately 6% due to rise in broiler (chicken) prices, the report said. On a month-on-month basis the cost of both vegetarian and non-vegetarian thalis came down.The calculation of an average thali's preparation cost at home by CRISIL considers input prices across different regions of India. Monthly variations indicate the impact on everyday household expenses. The analysis tracks price movements of essential ingredients including cereals, pulses, broilers, vegetables, spices, edible oil and cooking gas.The rise in non-vegetarian thali prices was primarily due to a 15% year-on-year increase in broiler (chicken) prices. Broiler (chicken), which constitutes approximately 50% of a non-vegetarian thali's cost, saw this increase due to previous year's low baseline when prices had fallen because of oversupply.Also Read | Q3 FY25 GDP grows at 6.2%; India sees 'highest growth in 12 years' in FY24 - top 10 data points to know Additionally, higher feed expenses, resulting from a 6% year-on-year increase in maize prices, contributed to the overall cost surge.During the month, both vegetarian and nonvegetarian thali costs decreased by 5% compared to the previous month. This reduction was attributed to fresh supplies causing price drops in onion (7%), potato (17%), and tomato (25%). Additionally, broiler (chicken) prices fell by an estimated 5% month-on-month due to reduced demand following bird flu concerns in southern India.","In February, the vegetarian thali saw a reduction in cost compared to the previous year.

MUMBAI: IndusInd Bank said valuation losses in its forex derivative contracts could impact the bank’s net worth by up to 2.4% or around Rs 1,530 crore. The announcement came hours after shares of the bank closed nearly 4% lower on Monday. The fall was triggered by RBI’s decision to approve only one-year extension for MD & CEO Sumant Kathpalia as against three years proposed by the board.Following a hasty board meeting on Monday, Kathpalia addressed investors in an analyst call. He could not explain the delay in recording the derivative valuation losses but said RBI may be ‘uncomfortable with his leadership skills’ in the context of his truncated tenure.The bank said it identified the discrepancies, which accumulated over time, by itself and assured that its profitability and capital adequacy could absorb the one-time impact. An external adviser has been appointed to investigate, with the review expected to conclude by fourth quarter.“As part of circular which came in Dec 22/Sep 23, we started reviewing our derivative book as effective April 24, new guidelines for internal trades had to be discontinued. We started observing some discrepancies in our business, which were identified between Sept and Oct, and we hired an external agency to review our business,” said Kathpalia. He said that all the discrepancies pertained to FY24 and earlier.RBI’s Dec 2022 circular restricted banks from allowing speculative or unregulated hedging for clients by ensuring that hedging is only permitted for actual or anticipated commodity price and freight risks. Banks also had to ensure that the hedge aligned with the entity’s exposure and was restricted to approved products, such as futures, swaps, and options.Forex derivatives are contracts used to bet on currency value changes, without buying or selling the currency. While useful for businesses to hedge against currency fluctuations , they can hurt banks if used for speculation, especially during sudden change in currency value. The rupee, which was steady against dollar for several years, had depreciated sharply after the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Those who would have bet on rupee remaining strong would have faced losses.IndusInd Bank said discrepancies stemmed from internal trades related to foreign currency positions, which were initially used to balance the bank's foreign currency books. Had the losses been identified in time the bank would have taken a hit in its trading income and interest income. The issue, however, was only discovered in last few months, despite multiple audits over the years.","IndusInd Bank said valuation losses in its forex derivative contracts could impact the bank’s net worth by up to 2.4% or around Rs 1,530 crore.

MUMBAI: The size of funds collectively raised by investors for allocating to Indian startups dropped to a four-year-low of $2.7 billion in 2024 as big players like SoftBank and Tiger Global refrained from making big bets, largely issuing smaller follow-on cheques for portfolio companies and remained cautious on overall deployment of capital.In 2023, investors had raised $4 billion, about 33% higher, a report by Bain & Company and Indian Venture and Alternate Capital Association ( IVCA ) showed.A global tech downturn, which had gripped markets in parts of 2022 and 2023 nudged venture capital (VC) and growth funds to go slow on investments — this basically meant that they could not deploy all the funds raised earlier and are still sitting on significant capital, readjusting their new fund targets.“Leading VC funds had sizeable fundraises in 2022 and 2023 and deployments were measured in H2 (second half) of 2022 and 2023. Most of the top VCs did not see the need to raise another big fund,” Prabhav Kashyap, partner at Bain & Company told TOI.In fact, the number of $100 million plus funds raised shrunk to four last year from 10 in 2023. VC firm Accel was an outlier though, having closed a $650 million fund to back local startups. “Fund-raising declined as top investors (barring Accel) tempered activity….crossover funds remain subdued. Tiger Global maintained its focus on backing existing portfolio companies without making new bets. SoftBank marked its return to Indian startups after an 18-month hiatus by exclusively funding existing investments,” analysts at Bain said.To give a broader perspective, Tiger Global’s last venture capital fund closed in early 2024 and raised $2.2 billion, short of its initial target of $6 billion and lower than its previous $12.7 billion fund raised in 2022. “From a value creation and returns perspective, funds want to focus on topline growth and margin expansion, and not multiple expansion. In India, the valuation multiples are still elevated compared to most other markets despite a correction,” said Kashyap.With big global investors on the sidelines, local family offices and India-focused hedge funds like Hornbill Capital are driving startup investments. And, the trend will continue, analysts said. Nearly 50% of $100 million plus deals last year were led or co-led by such players and a few emerging global VCs like StepStone and Glade Brook. Zepto’s $350 million funding in Nov was fully backed by domestic investors, including a clutch of family offices, while PhysicsWallah’s $210 million funding was led by Hornbill Capital.Startup funding, which has been tepid so far this year is expected to pick up pace in the coming months. The subdued sentiment prevailing in the public markets has spilled over to private markets, leading to some cautious funding, analysts said.","In 2023, investors had raised $4 billion, about 33% higher, a report by Bain & Company and Indian Venture and Alternate Capital Association ( IVCA ) showed.

US stocks tumbled Monday as ongoing tariff disputes and concerns over a potential federal government shutdown fueled fears of a looming recession.Last week's sharp selloff continued, gaining steam throughout the session, with all three major indexes posting steep losses.The S&P 500 is now down over 8% from its February 19 all-time high, and the Nasdaq Composite has officially entered correction territory after falling more than 10% from its December peak. A mix of economic uncertainty, fears of a potential recession, and escalating trade tensions has led to a wave of selloffs, wiping out trillions in market value.Also read: BSE Sensex sinks over 400 points; Nifty50 below 22,350 Key factors contributing to this decline include high stock valuations compared to historical averages, economic uncertainty triggered by shifting trade policies, and disappointing corporate earnings. Tesla, for example, saw its market value drop by more than $125 billion in a single day. Additionally, companies like Delta Air Lines have cut their profit forecasts, citing concerns over economic conditions. Investors remain on edge as they monitor upcoming inflation reports, interest rate policies, and potential government actions to stabilize the economy.The recent selloff is driven by multiple factors, including trade policy uncertainties, fears of a potential recession, and concerns over high stock valuations. As Peter Orszag, CEO of Lazard, explains: ""The amount of uncertainty that has been created by the tariff wars with regard to Canada, Mexico and Europe is causing boards and C-suites to reconsider the pathway forward.""The S&P 500 has fallen over 8.6% from its February 19 high, erasing more than $4 trillion in market value. The Nasdaq Composite is officially in correction territory, down over 10% from its December peak.Technology stocks have suffered the most significant losses. Tesla lost $125 billion in value in a single day, while Apple and Nvidia both fell about 5%. The S&P 500’s technology sector dropped 4.3% overall. Meanwhile, Delta Air Lines' stock plunged 14% after it cut its first-quarter profit estimates by half.Read also: What could be the impact of Trump's tariff flip flop on Indian stock market? Yes, investor concerns about a potential recession have intensified.In an interview broadcast on Sunday, US President Donald Trump described the current situation as “a period of transition” and didn't dismiss the possibility of a recession. When asked on Fox News' “Sunday Morning Futures With Maria Bartiromo” whether he anticipated a recession this year, Trump replied, “I hate to predict things like that. There is a period of transition because what we’re doing is very big.”Ross Mayfield, an investment strategist at Baird, noted: ""The Trump administration seems a little more accepting of the idea that they’re OK with the market falling, and they’re potentially even OK with a recession in order to exact their broader goals.""The White House has pushed back against recession fears , insisting that the economy remains strong despite the market downturn. Kevin Hassett, head of the National Economic Council, said: ""There are a lot of reasons to be extremely bullish about the economy going forward. But for sure, this quarter, there are some blips in the data.""He also suggested that the uncertainty around tariffs would be resolved soon, emphasizing that tax cuts would help boost investment and real wages. However, investors remain skeptical, with ongoing market volatility reflecting broader concerns.Investors are keeping an eye on several key factors, including the upcoming inflation report, interest rate decisions from the Federal Reserve, and potential government measures to stabilize the economy. A further retreat in investor confidence could push markets even lower. As Dan Coatsworth, an investment analyst at AJ Bell, said: ""Many people have been worried about elevated valuations among US equities for some time and looking for the catalyst for a market correction.""With market volatility continuing, investors should stay informed and consider diversification strategies to manage risk.","The S&P 500 has fallen over 8.6% from its February 19 high, erasing more than $4 trillion in market value.

What's Daylight Saving Time

?

When does it begin?

Is Daylight Saving Time worth it? Debate rages on

What Trump said

Trump Asked When He Will Get Rid Of Daylight Saving Time, Says It Is A '50/50 Issue'

Clocks in the US will jump an hour on Sunday, marking the start of Daylight Saving Time . This annual practice moves clocks forward by one hour during the summer months.It’s an yearly practice in the US and Europe to move clocks forward during summer, extending evening daylight to optimise energy use and better align daily schedules with natural light.In North America, Daylight Saving Time 2025 will begin on Sunday, March 9, at 2:00 AM local standard time and will end on November 2 at 2:00 AM.At that moment, clocks will move forward one hour to 3:00 AM local daylight time. This change extends evening daylight but shortens the morning hours. While most of the United States observes DST, some regions do not follow the springtime adjustment.In Europe, Daylight Saving Time will start on March 30, 2025, at 1:00 AM GMT, with clocks moving forward by one hour. Most European countries follow this change to extend daylight hours during the spring and summer months.After winning the election last year, Trump had said he and Republicans would work to “eliminate” daylight saving time, calling it inconvenient and costly.However, when asked in the Oval Office on Thursday about eliminating Daylight Saving Time, Trump said, “It’s a 50-50 issue, and when something is split like that, it’s hard to get excited about it.”Trump said he figured most people would prefer more daylight in the evening but acknowledged that “some people want more light in the morning because they don’t want to take their kids to school in the dark.”","Clocks in the US will jump an hour on Sunday, marking the start of Daylight Saving Time.

Artificial intelligence at work



Stay informed with the latest business news, updates on bank holidays and public holidays.





Almost every day, Grant Lee, a Silicon Valley entrepreneur, hears from investors who try to persuade him to take their money. Some have even sent him and his co-founders personalised gift baskets.Lee, 41, would normally be flattered. In the past, a fast-growing startup like Gamma, an artificial intelligence company he helped establish in 2020, would have constantly looked out for more funding. But like many young startups in Silicon Valley today, Gamma is pursuing a different strategy. It is using AI tools to increase its employees’ productivity in everything from customer service and marketing to coding and customer research.That means Gamma, which makes software that lets people create presentations and websites, has no need for more cash, Lee said. His company has hired only 28 people to get “tens of millions” in annual recurring revenue and nearly 50 million users. Gamma is also profitable. “If we were from the generation before, we would easily be at 200 employees,” Lee said. “We get a chance to rethink that, basically rewrite the playbook.”The old Silicon Valley model dictated that startups should raise a huge sum of money from venture capital investors and spend it hiring an army of employees to scale up fast. Profits would come much later. Until then, head count and fundraising were badges of honour among founders, who philosophised that bigger was better.But Gamma is among a growing cohort of startups, most of them working on AI products, that are also using AI to maximise efficiency. They make money and are growing fast without the funding or employees they would have needed before. The biggest bragging rights for these startups are for making the most revenue with the fewest workers. Stories of “tiny team” success have now become a meme, with techies excitedly sharing lists that show how Anysphere, a startup that makes the coding software Cursor, hit $100 million in annual recurring revenue in less than two years with just 20 employees, and how ElevenLabs, an AI voice startup, did the same with about 50 workers.The potential for AI to let startups do more with less has led to wild speculation about the future. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has predicted there could someday be a one-person company worth $1 billion. His company, which is building a cost-intensive form of AI called a foundational model, employs more than 4,000 people and has raised more than $20 billion in funding. It is also in talks to raise more money.With AI tools, some startups are now declaring that they will stop hiring at a certain size. Runway Financial, a finance software company, has said it plans to top out at 100 employees because each of its workers will do the work of 1.5 people. Agency, a startup using AI for customer service, also plans to hire no more than 100 workers.“It’s about eliminating roles that are not necessary when you have smaller teams,” said Elias Torres, Agency’s founder. The idea of AI-driven efficiency was bolstered in Jan by DeepSeek, a Chinese AI startup that showed it could build AI tools for a small fraction of the typical cost. Its breakthrough, built on open-source tools that are freely available online, set off an explosion of companies building new products using DeepSeek’s inexpensive techniques.“DeepSeek was a watershed moment,” said Gaurav Jain, an investor at the venture firm Afore Capital, which has backed Gamma. “The cost of compute is going to go down very, very fast, very quickly.” Jain compared new AI startups to the wave of companies that arose in the late 2000s, after Amazon began offering cheap cloud computing services. That lowered the cost of starting a company, leading to a flurry of new startups that could be built more cheaply.Before this AI boom, startups generally burned $1 million to get to $1 million in revenue, Jain said. Now, getting to $1 million in revenue costs one-fifth as much and could eventually drop to one-tenth, according to an analysis of 200 startups conducted by Afore. “This time, we’re automating humans as opposed to just the data centers,” Jain said.But if startups can become profitable without spending much, that could become a problem for venture capital investors, who allocate tens of billions to invest in AI startups. Last year, AI companies raised $97 billion in funding, making up 46% of all venture investment in the United States, according to PitchBook, which tracks startups. “Venture capital only works if you get money into the winners,” said Terrence Rohan, an investor with Otherwise Fund, which focuses on very young startups.",Gamma is using AI tools to increase its employees’ productivity in everything from customer service and marketing to coding and customer research.

China retaliated against President Donald Trump's tariffs with an additional 15% tax on key American farm products, including chicken, pork, soybeans and beef.The escalating trade tensions punished US markets Monday as investors fearful of the damage from from Trump's trade wars put their money elsewhere.The Chinese tariffs, announced last week, were a response to Trump's decision to double the levy on Chinese imports to 20% on March 4. China's Commerce Ministry had earlier said that goods already in transit would be exempt from the retaliatory tariffs until April 12.Imposing tariffs on imports is a key part of Trump's agenda. He believes the import taxes can raise money for the Treasury, protect American industries and pressure foreign countries to do what he wants in a range of issues, including immigration and drug trafficking.On Wednesday, Trump is set to remove exceptions on 25% steel tariffs he imposed in 2018 - effectively raising the taxes - and raise his levy on aluminum from 10% to 25%.In a bewildering series of announcements last week, Trump slapped tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports, then delayed many of them for 30 days. Next month, he could plaster ""reciprocal tariffs'' - meant to raise U.S. tariffs to match higher tariffs imposed by foreign countries - on a wide range of imports from around the world.Economists warn that tariffs raise prices for consumers and make the US economy less efficient as protected American companies have less incentive to innovate.There's also the threat of retaliation, and farmers, who are among Trump's most loyal supporters and also have vigilant defenders in Congress, make a tempting target.China also hit American farm products during the president's first-term trade wars. US farm sales to China plummeted, then recovered after the two countries reached a truce in January 2020 and Beijing promised to buy more from US farmers. American farm exports to China peaked at $38 billion in 2022, then fell to $29 billion in 2023 and $25 billion last year. In January, they were down 56% from a year earlier, according to the US Department of Agriculture.During his first term, Trump spent tens of billions of dollars in taxpayer money to compensate farmers for lost exports.","China retaliated against President Donald Trump's tariffs with an additional 15% tax on key American farm products. The Chinese tariffs, announced last week, were a response to Trump's decision to double the levy on Chinese imports to 20% on March 4. China's Commerce Ministry had earlier said that goods already in transit would be exempt from the retaliatory tariffs until April 12.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118855271,imgsize-49548,width-400,resizemode-4/118855271.jpg"

Wall Street’s sell-off deepened Monday, with growing concerns about the economy and President Donald Trump’s tariffs driving US stocks further from their recent record highs.In early trading, the S&P 500 dropped 1.4%, following its worst week since September. As of 9:35 a.m. Eastern time, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 430 points, or 1%, and the Nasdaq composite had fallen 2.1%, according to news agency AP.The primary US stock market measure is now headed for its seventh swing of more than 1%, up or down, in the last eight days, after a tumultuous period dominated by fears that Trump’s on-and-off tariffs could either directly harm the economy or create enough uncertainty to paralyze US companies and consumers. The S&P 500 is down 7.4% from its all-time high reached on February 19.The economy has shown signs of weakening, mainly reflected in surveys indicating increased pessimism. Additionally, a real-time collection of indicators compiled by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta suggests the US economy could already be contracting.When asked over the weekend about the possibility of a recession in 2025, Trump told Fox News Channel, “I hate to predict things like that. There is a period of transition because what we’re doing is very big. We’re bringing wealth back to America. That’s a big thing.” He added, “It takes a little time. It takes a little time.”On the same weekend, US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick stated on NBC’s “Meet the Press” that 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum imports would take effect Wednesday.While the US job market remains stable and the economy ended last year with solid growth, economists are lowering their forecasts for 2025. For instance, at Goldman Sachs, David Mericle revised his US economic growth estimate to 1.7% from 2.2% for the end of 2025, primarily due to higher-than-expected tariffs. He now sees a one-in-five chance of a recession in the next year.The sell-off has notably hit some of Wall Street’s biggest stars the hardest, particularly Big Tech stocks and companies benefiting from the artificial intelligence boom in recent years.Nvidia dropped another 2.6% on Monday, bringing its year-to-date loss to 18.3%, a stark contrast to its nearly 820% surge in 2023 and 2024.Apple also saw a 3.2% decline, making it the heaviest drag on the S&P 500 after confirming that it would delay the AI update to its Siri personal assistant until 2026.The downward trend isn't limited to Big Tech; investors are also pulling back on various investments that had previously seen unstoppable momentum, including bitcoin. The cryptocurrency’s value has dropped to around $83,000 from more than $106,000 in December.In the midst of this uncertainty, investors have flocked to US Treasury bonds as a safer bet. This surge in demand has led to higher Treasury prices and lower yields.The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.24% from 4.32% late Friday. It has been on a downward trend since January when it was nearing 4.80%, amid growing economic concerns.On Wall Street, Redfin saw a sharp 77% increase after Rocket announced it would acquire the digital real estate brokerage in an all-stock deal valued at $1.75 billion. Rocket’s stock, however, sank 9.7%.Internationally, European indexes also dropped, following a mixed session in Asia.Indexes in Hong Kong and Shanghai fell 1.8% and 0.2%, respectively, after China reported that consumer prices fell in February for the first time in 13 months. This marks the latest indication of weakness in the world’s second-largest economy, as weak demand was exacerbated by the early timing of the Lunar New Year holiday.","The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 430 points, or 1%, and the Nasdaq composite had fallen 2.1%.

Consumer prices fell in China in February for the first time in 13 months, as persistent weak demand was compounded by the early timing of the Lunar New Year holiday.The National Bureau of Statistics said Sunday that the consumer price index dropped 0.7% in February compared with a year ago. On a monthly basis, prices were down 0.2% from January.While many other countries wrestle with inflation, China's policymakers face flat to falling prices, and the possibility they could evolve into a deflationary spiral that would drag down the economy. The government stressed the need to increase domestic demand and consumer spending in an annual report last week to its ceremonial legislature, the National People's Congress, but held back on unveiling any dramatic new steps to boost the economy.The Lunar New Year, a time when spending rises for travel, dining out and entertainment, came in late January this year instead of February, as it's based on the cycles of the moon. Holiday spending helped drive the consumer price index up 0.5% in January, but it then fell last month compared with 2024's elevated level.Factoring out the impact of the holiday, the index rose 0.1% last month, Dong Lijuan, a statistician at the government's statistics bureau, said in a written analysis.That is still far lower than ideal. Last week's government annual report included an inflation target of 2% for this year, but it is likely to fall far short of that goal. The consumer price index was flat in 2024, rising 0.2%.Besides the early Lunar New Year, two other factors contributed to falling prices in February, Dong said: Better weather boosted farm production, driving down the price of fresh vegetables and automakers also stepped up promotions to try to boost sales, reducing prices for new cars.The producer price index, which measures the wholesale price of goods, fell 2.2% in February, the statistics bureau said. Producer prices have been falling more sharply than consumer prices, putting pressure on companies to cut labor and other costs.The falling prices are a symptom of both weak consumer spending and a massive expansion of factories to build electric vehicles, solar panels and other green-energy products, encouraged by government subsidies.A burgeoning trade war with the United States could add to China's economic challenges, which include a prolonged real estate market crisis that is weighing on consumer confidence.Government ministers, speaking to journalists at the National People's Congress on Sunday, pledged continued efforts to stabilize the real estate market and said that expanding employment in the current economic environment would be ""a heavy task.""The employment situation is showing signs of improvement but the foundation for economic recovery remains unstable, said Wang Xiaoping, the minister of human resources and social security.""The pressure on total employment remains unchanged,"" she said, noting that people are facing difficulties finding work and raising their incomes.For real estate, a portion of this year's 4.4 trillion yuan ($600 billion) in special local government bonds would go toward purchasing completed but unsold housing projects and converting them to affordable housing, apartments for young people, staff dormitories and other uses, said Ni Hong, the minister of housing and urban-rural development.The government will also expand a program to rehabilitate older housing including adding all compounds built before 2000 to its urban renovation scheme, he said.","Consumer prices fell in China in February for the first time in 13 months.

Donald Trump’s latest tariff threats have added volatility to global stock markets, with India emerging as a key player in the US president’s trade realignment strategy.India put a 9.5% tariff on US goods, while the US imposes just 3% on Indian products. As reciprocal tariffs loom, industries like automobiles, pharmaceuticals, textiles, and steel are at risk. Despite a short rally this week, the Nifty remains down 14% from its peak, with smallcaps in bear market territory. Over $15 billion has been pulled out by Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) in 2025 alone.Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) have maintained their selling trend in Indian equities this March, with total equity outflows reaching Rs 24,753 crore as of March 7, bringing the year-to-date total to Rs 1,37,354 crore in CY25, according to ET report.India is particularly vulnerable to tariff hikes, with key sectors facing significant threats. The Indian Rupee has weakened, and foreign investment is retreating due to concerns about a slowdown.Ross Maxwell, Global Strategy Operations Lead at VT Markets said that India’s automobile, pharmaceutical, textiles, and steel sectors could face severe impacts. However, India’s diplomatic approach—focused on trade negotiations and tariff rationalization—could help mitigate risks. YES Securities suggests reducing tariffs on US imports like steel and encouraging American companies like Tesla to enter India, which could serve as leverage against potential retaliatory tariffs.VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services, explains that markets perceive Trump’s moves as temporary negotiations rather than long-term tariff impositions, acknowledging that sustained tariffs could hurt the US economy. In response, China and Germany have already implemented domestic stimulus measures to counterbalance the effects of Trump’s policies, adding another layer of complexity to the global economic landscapeThe pharmaceutical sector, which holds 35% of the US market, faces short-term challenges but may benefit in the long term due to India’s competitive advantage over China. Amisha Vora, Chairperson & MD of PL Group, emphasized that despite tariff concerns, India remains more competitive than China, which faces a 20% tariff. Sandip Sabharwal, a market expert, pointed out that large-cap pharma stocks like Sun Pharma and Lupin have already experienced sell-offs but remain well-positioned unless tariffs escalate significantly.Despite global uncertainties, Indian markets show resilience. Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services, noted that India’s markets have remained strong despite equity outflows from emerging markets.Amisha Vora sees the current dip as an investment opportunity. “With ongoing reforms and India’s demographic advantage, the market will likely perform better, even amidst trade wars,” Vora told ET suggesting a potential correction of 4-5% in the short term.","Donald Trump’s latest tariff threats have added volatility to global stock markets.

A recent report showed plummeting sales in Europe, and the company faces increased competition from other EV makers eating away at its market share. Recent protests outside Tesla showrooms in the United States and some notable cases of vehicle owners being harassed have also made headlines.

""We need to get better value for money from taxpayers' contributions,"" she added.Any reforms could potentially conflict with the finance minister's self-imposed fiscal rules, which prevent borrowing for day-to-day spending. These rules are meant to maintain the credibility of the government's fiscal policies in financial markets.Meanwhile, Prime Minister Keir Starmer has pledged to increase UK defence spending to 2.5% of the national economy by 2027, a commitment spurred by growing concerns over the US's stance on Ukraine and NATO.","Britain's finance minister, Rachel Reeves, has called for urgent reforms to the country's welfare system.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"
E-commerce firm Udaan raises $340 million ahead of planned IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-firm-udaan-raises-340-million-ahead-of-planned-ipo/articleshow/105991030.cms,"Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.","Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain.

Startups will play important role in helping India become 3rd largest economy: CEA Nageswaran,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/startups-will-play-important-role-in-helping-india-become-3rd-largest-economy-cea-nageswaran/articleshow/105332523.cms,"Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor ( CEA ) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

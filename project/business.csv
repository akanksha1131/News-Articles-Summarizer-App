Income Tax Department Crackdown

Income Tax Department’s extensive crackdown! Over the past 20 months, the Income Tax Department has collected Rs 37,000 crore from individuals who had taxable income but failed to file returns, according to officials.Officials analysed data on substantial transactions since 2019-20, including purchases of gems, jewellery, property and luxury holidays paid in cash. ""These are the cases where people were not filing tax returns despite making large purchases. The department had reached out to them over the past 20 months,"" a senior official informed ET.The official noted that an expanded and stricter tax collection and TDS system has helped identify significant transactions that previously went unnoticed.The official indicated that some individuals submitted returns claiming zero income despite substantial expenditure and tax obligations. From the total Rs 37,000 crore recovered, Rs 1,320 crore came from individuals involved in high-value transactions.The department is conducting an extensive initiative to contact taxpayers whose spending patterns do not align with their declared income.Since FY21, it has actively used data analytics and the Non-Filer Monitoring System to identify non-compliant individuals.""Data from multiple sources is being tapped and synchronised... This makes it easy for the department to identify such evasion and nab evaders,"" the official stated.Official data revealed that direct tax collections for April-November increased by 15.4% to Rs 12.10 lakh crore, comprising Rs 5.10 lakh crore in corporate tax and Rs 6.61 lakh crore in non-corporate tax.","Officials analysed data on substantial transactions since 2019-20, including purchases of gems, jewellery, property and luxury holidays paid in cash.

"India’s richest men, Mukesh Ambani & Gautam Adani, drop out of elite $100 billion net worth club: Report",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/indias-richest-men-mukesh-ambani-gautam-adani-drop-out-of-elite-100-billion-net-worth-club-report/articleshow/116359954.cms,"Currently, both Mukesh Ambani and his contemporary Gautam Adani, are confronting various challenges.

India’s richest men, Mukesh Ambani and Gautam Adani , have seen their net worth drop below the $100 billion mark in the last few months. Currently, both Mukesh Ambani, who leads Reliance Industries Ltd, and his contemporary Gautam Adani, who established the Adani Group , are confronting various challenges affecting their commercial interests and personal wealth, according to a Bloomberg report.Ambani's ventures in energy and retail sectors have shown diminished performance, with investors expressing worries about debt levels. Meanwhile, Adani's business empire faces scrutiny following a US Department of Justice investigation, potentially affecting its access to funding and ability to secure contracts.Adani encountered fresh challenges in November when US prosecutors investigated alleged bribery, bringing unwanted attention. This followed his ongoing efforts to rebuild investor trust after Hindenburg Research published allegations of fraudulent practices at his company the previous year.Adani has rejected both accusations and remains determined to fight them. During a post-US allegations event, he emphasised the organisation's dedication to ""world-class regulatory compliance"" and stated that each challenge against the company ""only makes us stronger.""Also Read | Top 10 biggest wealth creating stocks: Reliance Industries tops list; Adani Green emerges as fastest wealth creator, says MOFSL report The allegations are expected to impact the group and its market value into the coming year.Gautam Adani's wealth reached its highest point at $122.3 billion in June, following efforts to strengthen finances after Hindenburg's accusations. These gains have since disappeared following US claims of his involvement in bribing Indian government officials, reducing his current worth to $82.1 billion, as per theBloomberg Billionaires Index .The decline in wealth isn't unique to him. Ambani, currently Asia's wealthiest individual, has also experienced a significant reduction in his fortune, albeit less publicly. His wealth peaked at approximately $120.8 billion in July, coinciding with his Anant Ambani’s lavish wedding celebrations.His flagship Reliance enterprise has faced challenges with declining energy sector earnings and reduced consumer spending in retail operations. As of December 13, his wealth stood at $96.7 billion.Also Read | ‘US Department of Justice has no business…’: Mark Mobius says US DOJ overstepped bounds on Adani case Both business leaders have now fallen from the centibillionaires category - individuals possessing wealth exceeding $100 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.Ambani's strategy involves increasing focus on digital platforms, retail brands, and renewable energy to boost growth. However, retail operations show slower sales and profit growth, whilst digital competitors have gained market share in groceries and household items, particularly in India's major urban centres.The arrival of Elon Musk's Starlink in India's satellite broadband sector also poses a potential challenge to Jio Platforms Ltd's digital and telecom operations. Additionally, declining demand and Chinese exports are affecting the oil-to-chemicals division.""Reliance remains a strong wealth creator and each business has great value. But the pressure on the oil business has caused the stock to under perform,"" Kranthi Bathini, equity market strategist at Mumbai-based WealthMills Securities Pvt was quoted as saying by BloombergReliance's technological aspirations are evident in its collaboration with Walt Disney Co., forming an $8.5 billion media enterprise set to lead India's streaming sector. The company has also strengthened its alliance with Nvidia Corp., aiming to develop AI computing infrastructure in India.Both organisations face additional challenges in the upcoming year, particularly regarding Donald Trump's election implications and uncertainties surrounding Indian commercial prospects.""In the short term there are challenges, especially with Trump imposing tariffs that's going to make India's exports not that competitive,"" said V.K. Unni, a professor at the Indian Institute of Management Calcutta.Nevertheless, India's wealthiest individuals continue to prosper, with the top twenty adding $67.3 billion since the year's beginning, according to Bloomberg's wealth index.

Nissan and Honda consider merger to take on world's biggest carmaker,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/nissan-and-honda-consider-merger-to-take-on-worlds-biggest-carmaker/articleshow/116417671.cms,"Honda, Nissan (Agencies)

Taking on Toyota



Honda Motor Co. and Nissan Motor Co. are exploring a potential merger, according to people familiar with the matter, which would create a singular rival to Toyota Motor Corp. in Japan and better position the combined company to face competitive challenges around the world.Honda is considering several options including a merger, capital tie-up or the establishment of a holding company, Executive Vice President Shinji Aoyama said on Wednesday, following reports overnight of talks between the carmakers. Nissan shares rose as much as 24% in early trading on Wednesday, while Honda’s stock fell as much as 3.4%.The two have been holding preliminary talks about a combination, said the people, who asked not to be identified because discussions are private. One option being considered is the creation of a new holding company under which the combined businesses would operate, one of the people said. The transaction could also be expanded to include Mitsubishi Motors Corp, which already has capital ties with Nissan, the person said.Discussions are early stage and may not lead to an agreement, the people said.A deal would effectively consolidate the Japanese auto industry into two main camps: One controlled by Honda, Nissan and Mitsubishi and another consisting of Toyota group companies. It would also provide them with more resources to compete with larger peers globally after downsizing long-held partnerships with other carmakers. Nissan has loosened ties with France’s Renault SA and Honda has backed away from General Motors Co.The move toward a merger would follow a decision by the two companies earlier this year to work together on electric vehicle batteries and software. At that time, Honda Chief Executive Officer Toshihiro Mibe floated the possibility of a capital tie-up with Nissan.“If the merger does materialize, it would provide short-term relief for Nissan’s financial struggles,” said Bloomberg Intelligence senior auto analyst Tatsuo Yoshida.The two Japanese carmakers plan to sign a memorandum of understanding to discuss shared equity stakes in a new holding company, the Nikkei reported earlier in the day. The merger would help the manufacturers compete against rivals in electric vehicles such as Tesla Inc. and Chinese automakers, it said.American depositary receipts of Honda and Nissan shares climbed on the report. Nissan ADRs rose 12% and Honda’s gained 0.9% in late New York trading.In some ways, it could be seen as a defensive merger among Japan’s weaker players. Honda, Nissan and Mitsubishi combined sold about 4 million vehicles globally in the first six months of the year, well shy of the 5.2 million that Toyota sold on its own. Combining forces would allow the two companies to fend off Toyota, the world’s largest automaker, at home and abroad. Toyota has taken stakes in Subaru Corp., Suzuki Motor Corp. and Mazda Motor Corp., creating a powerhouse of brands backed by its top-notch credit rating.“While this would be good news for Nissan due to their weakened state, they would have a lot of overlap and other issues to overcome,” said Julie Boote, a senior analyst at Pelham Smithers Associates. “For the Toyota group though we could see an acceleration there as well as it gathers its flock more tightly under its wing in a show of commitment, with the possibility of raising its stakes in Subaru, Suzuki and Mazda sooner rather than later.”Honda’s valuation stood at ¥6.8 trillion ($44.4 billion) as of the close of trading in Tokyo on Tuesday, well above Nissan’s ¥1.3 trillion market capitalization. But even their combined value is dwarfed by Toyota’s ¥42.2 trillion.Honda has long struggled to keep up with bigger capitalized rivals when it comes to investments in new technologies. It recently has shifted gears to boost hybrid gas-electric vehicles even as it spends billions of dollars on all-electric production. At the same time, Honda’s arms-length partnership with GM has been weakened, most recently earlier this month when their self-driving car partnership ended. GM has strengthened its ties with South Korea’s Hyundai Motor Co.Nissan is in need of a partner to put it back on a stronger financial footing as it steps up restructuring efforts to cope with stalled revenue growth and lower profits. It faces pressure from an activist shareholder and a daunting debt load that has led to speculation in credit markets about its investment grade rating.The Yokohama-based company has partially unwound its complex 25-year strategic partnership with Renault, a fixation of former Chairman Carlos Ghosn. Rivalries and mutual suspicion mounted over the years and came to a head when Ghosn openly contemplated a merger, contributing to his downfall.The former chairman and CEO, who has filed a suit against his former company for ousting him in 2018, warned of a “disguised takeover” of Nissan by Honda in an August interview with Automotive News.The merger talks come after the Financial Times said last month that Nissan was looking for an anchor investor to replace part of Renault’s equity holding and that it hadn’t ruled out having Honda buy some of its shares.","Honda is considering several options including a merger, capital tie-up or the establishment of a holding company.

Vishal Mega Mart Ltd’s shares are set to start trading on Wednesday after raising $944 million in India’s last major new listing of the year.The sale attracted bids for over 27 times the 756.8 million shares offered at 78 rupees apiece, the top end of the price band, driven by strong demand from high-networth and retail investors. The IPO valued the Gurugram-based company at $4 billion.The company runs a network of over 600 stores across India, catering to the middle- and lower-income consumers. Its debut comes amid a tough environment, with quick-commerce firms upending traditional brick-and-mortar retailers. Investor sentiment has cooled toward Avenue Supermarts Ltd, the operator of DMart chain and the country’s largest value retailer.Vishal Mega Mart may still fare better than its rivals, as 75% of its stores are in second-tier cities and smaller towns. “The company’s focus on value pricing is attracting customers,” said Rajan Shinde, an analyst at Mehta Equities Ltd., adding that the valuation — 69 times annualized earnings for the latest fiscal year — is “reasonable” compared to peers trading at 90-100 times.Vishal Mega Mart derives over half its revenue from general merchandise and fast-moving consumer goods, with apparel accounting for the rest.

Chances that these Indians have any link with Donald Trump or Paul Atkins are even weaker. One thing, however, is emerging that could link all these people across the globe: Their love for cryptocurrencies.Smaller cities and towns in India are becoming active hubs of crypto trading, joining the bigger metros where people have been trading these digital assets for several years now. There's a growing appeal for cryptos among people - mostly 35 years old or younger - from places like Botad, Barbaka, Jalandhar, Kanchipuram, Patna and several other smaller Indian cities and towns, a report by CoinSwitch showed.""What was once concentrated in major metros is now quickly expanding to tier-two and tier-three cities, reflecting the growing appeal,"" said Balaji Srihari, VP, CoinSwitch. In India, which has more than two crore crypto users with the bulk of them under 35 years, the ecosystem is also evolving with investors diversifying their asset portfolio and taking their picks in meme coins to Layer-1 (assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum) and DeFi tokens.Local investors are increasingly taking to meme coins which make up for about 13% of all crypto investments in the country. Within the category, Dogecoin topped the list of the most invested coins while SHIB led the way for the most traded coins.The rush among Indians to invest in cryptocurrencies comes despite the imposition of steep taxes on crypto transactions - currently income from cryptocurrency transactions is taxed at 30% while a 1% TDS is levied on transactions exceeding Rs 50,000 annually. There are also deliberations within govt to regulate the crypto space.Recently, crypto lovers around the world got a boost after Donald Trump, a recently-turned crypto supporter, was elected the US President. And soon enough he nominated Paul Aktins, a lawyer and a long-time crypto supporter, to lead financial markets regulator SEC.These developments led to a nearly unabated rally in cryptos since the US election day. And in 2024 so far, Bitcoin has given a 144% return and a market cap of $2 trillion.

It has asked the general public to send in their comments and suggestions on this circular by Jan 7.MITRA would be able to assist investors to locate forgotten MF investments, ensure current KYC compliance, and implement protective measures against fraudulent withdrawals. This would help reduce unclaimed mutual fund accounts and enhance transparency in the financial system, Sebi said.At times, MF investors lose track of their investments, particularly those made physically with minimal KYC information over the years. In open-ended schemes with growth options, investments can remain indefinitely until the investor, nominee, or a legal heir contacts the fund house for withdrawal or transfer.

NEW DELHI: The Maharashtra cabinet was sworn in on Sunday in the presence of chief minister Devendra Fadnavis and his deputies Eknath Shinde and Ajit Pawar . Governor CP Radhakrishnan administered oath to the ministers at Raj Bhavan in Nagpur.The swearing-in of the state cabinet in Nagpur, which comes a day before the winter session of the legislature, marks a rare occasion as the last such ceremony in Nagpur happened in 1991, when the then governor C Subramaniam administered oath to Chhagan Bhujbal and other ministers.The portfolio allocation to the ministers is expected to wrap up soon as the parties have just one day to ascertain the roles of the MLAs before the session kicks off.The cabinet was sworn in ten days after Devendra Fadnavis took oath as chief minister at Mumbai's Azad Maidan. Prime Minister Narendra Modi attended the ceremony, which also saw Ajit Pawar from the NCP and former CM Eknath Shinde from Shiv Sena taking oath as deputy chief ministers.The prolonged deliberations over portfolio allocations and last-minute Cabinet swearing-in could be attributed to Mahayuti's challenges in balancing power with Shiv Sena and NCP factions, both eager to secure influential roles in the government.In the state polls, the BJP-led Mahayuti alliance secured a decisive victory, winning 235 seats. The BJP emerged as the single-largest party with 132 seats, while Shiv Sena won 57 and NCP secured 41 seats. The Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) alliance faced a major setback, with Congress winning just 16 seats, Shiv Sena (UBT) securing 20, and the NCP (Sharad Pawar faction) claiming only 10 seats.","Chandrashekhar Bawankule, BJP's state president, was the first to be sworn in as cabinet minister.

Your views on the IER?

Who can apply for International Entrepreneur Parole?

Have major ownership (at least 10% initially) in a US startup created within the last 5 years.

Play a central and active role in the startup.

Can show that the startup will have a positive public benefit on the U.S. by having:



Received a significant investment from qualified U.S. investors (typically venture capitalists, angel investors, or startup accelerators).



Received significant awards or grants from federal, state, or local government entities.



Partially meeting one or both of the above with added evidence showing potential for rapid growth or job creation.

What are the new threshold amounts for investment/grants?

The qualified investment amount has increased from $264,147 to $311,071.

The awards or grants amount has increased from $105,659 to $124,429.

What are the new criteria for qualified investors?

Why did the amounts change?

For want of a better term, the International Entrepreneur Rule (IER) is often referred to as the ‘start-up’ visa. IER enables ‘qualified’ international entrepreneurs (based on prescribed criteria including funds raised, to obtain immigration ‘parole’ – that is to temporarily enter and stay in the US and nurture their startup, despite not having a work visa or a green card. Commonly, IER is known as the startup visa, but it is actually a permit for eligible foreign entrepreneurs to stay in the US for two and a half years with the possibility of another extension of a similar tenure.Recently, US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has updated the threshold amounts for the IER program and updated the supporting evidence required. Starting October 1, 2024, there are new changes to the investment and revenue requirements.The program has had a contentious history. Originally created at the end of the Obama Administration, IER was targeted for removal by the Trump Administration before it was launched. Due to a successful lawsuit filed by the National Venture Capital Association, it remained in force but was not seen as a viable option as the Trump administration repeatedly tried to end the program.Finally in May 2021, under the Biden administration the US department of homeland security (DHS) announced that it is withdrawing a ‘proposed’ rule introduced by the Trump administration that would have rescinded the IER program. Given this past, till date only 94 IEP applications have been filed, with just 26 approvals. The approval can take anything between a few months to a few years.What happens next? It remains to be seen. Meanwhile, TOI spoke with, immigration attorney, to understand the IER program and the changes.IER is a fantastic initiative that allows certain foreign entrepreneurs to live and work in the US temporarily. While it’s not technically a visa, it provides a pathway for founders to enter the US, build their businesses, create jobs, and boost the economy.Innovation and entrepreneurship are the backbone of the American economy. They fuel job creation, spark new industries, and keep the US at the cutting edge of technological advancement. Immigrant entrepreneurs are a vital part of this, bringing fresh ideas and a relentless drive to succeed.Immigrant entrepreneurs may be eligible for the IEP if they:Remember that it is still possible to apply if you have received less than the above, but we would want to bolster the case with additional evidence of the startup’s potential for growth and job creation.A US investor is considered ‘qualified’ if they have made investments of at least $746,571 (previously $633,952) in other startups. Additionally, at least 2 of those startups must have created at least 5 qualified jobs or generated $622,142 (previously $528,293) in revenue with average annual revenue growth of at least 20%.By regulation, the investment and revenue amounts must be automatically adjusted every 3 years by the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U).","The International Entrepreneur Rule (IER) is often referred to as the ‘start-up’ visa.

The allegations

Facebook-Cambridge Analytica scandal

Settlement and mediation

The Australian Information Commissioner announced on Tuesday that it has withdrawn its civil penalty proceedings against Meta Platforms , following a $31.85 million (A$50 million) settlement by the Facebook parent company. The lawsuit, originally filed in 2020, centered on allegations that Meta had shared personal user data with the "" This is Your Digital Life "" personality quiz app, a key element of the wider Facebook-Cambridge Analytica data scandal.The lawsuit accused Meta of violating Australian privacy laws by disclosing the personal information of over 300,000 Australian users to the quiz app between 2014 and 2015. This disclosure was alleged to have occurred without the users' consent, as part of the broader controversy surrounding the misuse of data by the consulting firm Cambridge Analytica .According to the Australian Information Commissioner, Meta breached Australian Privacy Principle 6 by using the data for purposes other than what it was originally collected for, and failed to take reasonable steps to protect user data, violating Privacy Principle 11.1(b).The data misuse controversy first emerged in early 2018, with the Guardian reporting that Cambridge Analytica had harvested personal data from millions of Facebook users. Though 270,000 users consented to data collection via the ""This Is Your Digital Life"" app, the data of approximately 50 million users was ultimately exploited, allegedly to create voter profiles and target political ads.The scandal drew scrutiny globally, leading to fines for Facebook in the United States and the UK in 2019. Australia's privacy regulator launched its legal action against Meta in 2020, claiming that the data of 311,127 Australian Facebook users was exposed to the risk of unauthorized disclosure.Following the legal proceedings, Australia's federal court ordered Meta and the privacy commissioner to enter mediation in June 2023. The settlement reached in the mediation process marks the largest ever payment in Australia dedicated to addressing privacy concerns, according to Australian Information Commissioner Elizabeth Tydd.Meta spokespersons confirmed that the company settled the lawsuit ""on a no admission basis,"" signaling the closure of this chapter on past practices. Despite the settlement, the company’s involvement in the data scandal continues to affect its reputation worldwide.","Facebook settles with Meta Platforms for $31.85 million (A$50 million) The lawsuit centered on allegations that Meta shared personal user data with the ""This is Your Digital Life "" personality quiz app. The lawsuit accused Meta of violating Australian privacy laws by disclosing the personal information of over 300,000 Australian users to the quiz app between 2014 and 2015.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116383780,imgsize-468196,width-400,resizemode-4/116383780.jpg"
"Who is Daniel Kretinsky, the Czech dealmaker who’s buying Royal Mail?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/who-is-daniel-kretinsky-the-czech-dealmaker-whos-buying-royal-mail/articleshow/116376385.cms,"Here’s more on Kretinsky and how he made his fortune.

What are the origins of Kretinsky’s wealth?

How rich is Kretinsky now, and where are his assets?

What’s his investment strategy?

What’s Kretinsky’s interest in the Royal Mail?

Were there concerns over Kretinsky’s Royal Mail investment?

Daniel Kretinsky has spent more than a decade building a network of businesses across Europe, from power stations to retail chains and media outlets, with a recent focus on financially distressed assets.The 49-year-old Czech billionaire hasn’t shied away from investing in troubled businesses that are politically sensitive. In December, the UK government approved Kretinsky’s £3.6 billion ($4.6 billion) takeover of the Royal Mail ’s parent company after he made a series of investment commitments. Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds called it “yet another example of this government’s commitment to working hand in hand with business.”A lawyer by training, Kretinsky got his start in business in 1999 at private investment firm J&T in Prague. A decade later, he formed the energy group EPH , taking a minority stake and securing the backing of partners from J&T and the late Czech billionaire Petr Kellner.Through acquisitions, he created a conglomerate of dozens of companies operating in nine countries and in industries ranging from electricity production and distribution to natural gas transmission and storage, trading and logistics. Kretinsky also owns stakes in French food retailer Casino Guichard Perrachon SA, German industrial group Thyssenkrupp AG’s ailing steel unit and soccer clubs West Ham United and AC Sparta Praha.His net worth was $7 billion as of mid-December, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. That makes him the second-richest Czech after Renata Kellnerova — Kellner’s widow — and her family.Kretinsky’s business empire in the Czech Republic includes power generation, gas distribution and storage, heat production and media. He also controls companies in Slovakia, Germany, the UK, France, the Netherlands, Ireland and Italy.With his investments in energy-related business, Kretinsky has made a bet that it will take European countries longer than expected to wean their economies off fossil fuels. EPH, in which he now holds a controlling stake, scooped up assets that publicly traded utilities were forced to offload by banks under new environmental investing rules.By taking energy businesses private, Kretinsky has drawn criticism from climate campaign groups, which say those companies are now subject to weaker scrutiny of their environmental performance.Kretinsky has been diversifying his investments away from energy and said he aims to target industries that provide essential products and services — in areas such as infrastructure, retail and mail delivery.His business empire is spread across several companies, with the largest of these, EPH, holding assets valued at just under €29 billion ($30 billion). He usually works with a relatively small team of advisers on deals. His inner circle includes Chief Financial Officer Pavel Horsky, who’s been with EPH since its inception in 2009 and has been busy integrating Kretinsky’s assets under a new brand, EP Group.UK parcel delivery has boomed with the growth in online shopping, yet the former state-owned Royal Mail has been making losses due to tough competition. Previous management clashed with its large, unionized workforce, and its chief executive quit in May 2023 following a dispute over pay and conditions.Kretinsky agreed to buy International Distribution Services Plc , Royal Mail’s parent company, in May. At the time, he told Bloomberg News that the company needed investment to maintain its market share. Kretinsky’s company has promised to respect the Royal Mail’s obligation to deliver letters and parcels to every part of the UK, and not to change its ownership for at least three years.The sale to a foreign owner has been politically divisive as the delivery service was state-owned until 2013, when it was privatized.He has faced similar scrutiny of deals made in France. Last year, he led a group of investors who reached an agreement to re-capitalize and gain control over Casino, a major player in French food retail.","Daniel Kretinsky has spent more than a decade building a network of businesses across Europe.

Honeywell considers spinning off aerospace business amid Elliott's breakup push,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/honeywell-considers-spinning-off-aerospace-business-amid-elliotts-breakup-push/articleshow/116373580.cms,"Honeywell said on Monday it was considering a plan to separate its high-margin aerospace business, a move backed by activist investor Elliott Investment Management , which has been pushing for the company's breakup.The company, one of the last surviving U.S. conglomerates, has been on a deal-making spree this year under CEO Vimal Kapur, as it focuses on automation, aviation and energy businesses, while shedding segments that do not align with its plans.Its shares have, however, underperformed this year, attracting the attention of Elliott, which has taken a more than $5 billion stake in the company and pushed for the separation of its aerospace and automation business.Honeywell said on Monday its board had made ""significant progress"" on its review of strategic alternatives to date and the company would provide an update with its fourth-quarter results, usually scheduled in the last week of January. Shares were up 2% in early trade.Elliott responded by welcoming the company's announcement.""We believe the portfolio transformation Vimal and his team are leading represents the right course for Honeywell, and we look forward to the upcoming completion of the review and to supporting Honeywell as it implements the necessary steps to realize its full value,"" the activist investor said.A standalone aerospace business, which is Honeywell's biggest unit by revenue and counts Boeing and Airbus as its customers, could be valued between $90 billion and $120 billion including debt, analysts said.The aerospace unit, which builds everything from engines to cockpit components, has benefited from rising jet production in the last few years, though supply chain disruptions have hurt the company's ability to meet some of that demand.For the first nine months of 2024, Honeywell's aerospace business reported revenue of $11.47 billion, accounting for about 40% of the firm's total sales for the period.The jetmaking boom is set to continue in the coming years amid record backlogs at planemakers, while a shortage of planes is set to boost demand for repairs.""The setting of an imminent date (Q4 EPS) for a strategic update suggests a larger break-up is likely, in our view,"" Barclays analysts wrote in a note.A potential spinoff will echo a similar announcement by General Electric in 2021. As of Friday, GE's aerospace business had a higher market value than Honeywell as a whole.Honeywell had disclosed in November that it would sell its personal protective equipment business to Protective Industrial Products for about $1.33 billion in cash.The conglomerate has also bought Carrier's security business for $4.95 billion and acquired aerospace and defense firm CAES Systems for $1.9 billion as part of its wider shift.",Honeywell is considering a plan to separate its high-margin aerospace business. The move is backed by activist investor Elliott Investment Management. Elliott has taken a more than $5 billion stake in the company and pushed for the separation.

Why World Bank cancelled $500 million loan to Pakistan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/why-world-bank-cancelled-500-million-loan-to-pakistan/articleshow/116317050.cms,"The PACE program

Attempts for lower electricity prices

World Bank goals

The World Bank has withdrawn a budget support loan of more than $500 million to Pakistan as a result of the country failing to fulfil critical conditions within the time limit. The required conditions included revising the purchase power agreement in relation to the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor , according to The Express Tribune.The Washington-based international lender also declared that it would not be sanctioning any new budget supporting loans to the country during the current fiscal year which has sent a shock to the Pakistani economy as the country has almost exhausted its loan quota.""No budget support is planned for the current fiscal year, which ends in June 2025,"" the World Bank spokesperson stated.For this fiscal year, the IMF has identified a $2.5 billion external financing gap that needs to be addressed through new loans.The World Bank has canceled a loan of $500 to $600 million meant for Pakistan under the Affordable and Clean Energy Program (PACE-II), government sources revealed. Initially set at $500 million, the loan amount was later raised to $600 million to help address Pakistan's external financing gap, quoted news agency ANI.The PACE program was approved by the World Bank in June 2021, with the first tranche of USD 400 million already released. The second installment depended on meeting several conditions, such as holding talks with all Independent Power Producers (IPPs), especially the Chinese power plants built under CPEC. It was discovered that no progress had been made in renegotiating agreements with CPEC-related power plants as China has consistently refused to revisit these deals or restructure the energy debt, which amounts to approximately $16 billion.To reduce electricity costs, the government is renegotiating energy agreements with power plants set up under the 1994 and 2002 policies. The Chinese-owned power plants, along with several government-run plants, including four LNG-based and two nuclear plants, fall under the 2015 energy policy. Though the government has tried negotiating over 22 energy contracts yet, no significant reductions have been made in electricity prices which linger from 65 Pakistani Rupees (PKR) to 70 PKR.A spokesperson for the World Bank confirmed that ""slower-than-expected progress led to a shift in strategy in our support for reform"" in Pakistan's energy sector. The spokesperson further elaborated that the lender has been supporting power sector reforms through the PACE initiative.Even though slower progress led the World Bank to revise its lending strategy, the World Bank has continued its support by directly financing low-cost hydropower projects, including an additional $1 billion for the Dasu Hydropower project.Furthermore, the Bank has also continued working with all stakeholders to expedite the implementation of the Electricity Distribution Efficiency Improvement Project, aimed at improving efficiency in the power distribution sector. It has also offered technical assistance to promote private sector involvement in power distribution companies (DISCOs).For the ongoing fiscal year, Pakistan anticipated $2 billion in loans from the World Bank.However, by the end of the July-October period, only $349 million, 18 per cent of the planned amount, had been disbursed.Under the PACE-II program, Pakistan was expected to tackle inefficiencies in power distribution companies and reduce the growth of circular debt. However, the government has been unable to achieve either of these objectives. The government had approved a roadmap under PACE-I to encourage private sector involvement in the distribution sector, but it remained far from implementation.The National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA) recently reported that inefficiencies in power distribution companies led to losses of PKR 660 billion in the last fiscal year. During the same period, circular debt surged to PKR 2.393 trillion, far exceeding the targets set in agreements with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank.The successful implementation of this roadmap was essential for evaluating the progress of the power sector reform program, but it was not carried out.",The World Bank has withdrawn a budget support loan of more than $500 million to Pakistan as a result of the country failing to fulfil critical conditions.

Gold rally may slow down in 2025: WGC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/gold-rally-may-slow-down-in-2025-wgc/articleshow/116303894.cms,"Representative image

Gold prices are set to rise more slowly in 2025 after a record-breaking run this year, according to the World Gold Council .Bullion is up more than 30% so far in 2024, but gains next year will likely be tempered by variables like growth and inflation, the WGC said. Possible trade wars in US President-elect Donald Trump's second term and complicated interest-rate outlooks may spill over into subpar economic growth, hurting demand from investors and consumers, the industry association said in its 2025 outlook report released on Thursday.""All eyes are on the US. Trump's second term may provide a boost to the local economy but could equally elicit a fair degree of nervousness for investors around the world, it said.Bullion's rally in the early part of 2024 was driven by large purchases by central banks, especially the People's Bank of China and others in emerging markets. It got a further boost from the Federal Reserve's recent monetary easing and haven demand during periods of heightened geopolitical tensions including wars in West Asia and Ukraine. However, gains have stalled due to a rally in the dollar following Trump's election win.Some banks are still bullish on the prospects of the precious metal, currently trading near $2,700 an ounce, next year. Goldman Sachs Group is forecasting it will get to $3,000 by the end of 2025, while UBS AG sees $2,900.China's actions in the gold market will be closely watched. So far, investors there have provided price support, while consumers have stayed on the sidelines, but ""these dynamics hang on the direct (and indirect) effects of trade, stimulus and perceptions of risk,"" the WGC said.The yellow metal will rise if the world sees ""significantly lower interest rates, or a deterioration in geopolitics or financial market conditions,"" the council said. Lower rates typically benefit gold as it pays no interest.","Bullion is up more than 30% so far in 2024, but gains next year will likely be tempered by variables like growth and inflation.

Both countries subsequently joined the OECD.In 2021, Switzerland interpreted that when Colombia and Lithuania joined the OECD, a 5 per cent dividend rate would apply to the India-Switzerland tax treaty under the MFN clause, instead of the agreement's stated 10 per cent.Following the MFN status suspension, from January 1, 2025, Switzerland will impose a 10 per cent tax on dividends for Indian tax residents seeking Swiss withholding tax refunds and Swiss tax residents claiming foreign tax credits.The Swiss finance department officially announced the suspension of the MFN clause protocol between Switzerland and India regarding double taxation avoidance on income taxes.The Swiss authorities cited a 2023 Indian Supreme Court ruling in a case involving Vevey-based Nestle as the basis for withdrawing the MFN status.This decision means Swiss authorities will levy a 10 per cent tax on dividends earned by Indian entities in Switzerland from January 1, 2025.The statement notes that whilst the Delhi High Court supported the applicability of residual tax rates considering the MFN clause in 2021, the Indian Supreme Court reversed this on October 19, 2023, concluding that the MFN clause was not directly applicable without proper notification under Section 90 of the Income Tax Act.Nangia Andersen M&A Tax Partner Sandeep Jhunjhunwala commented that this unilateral suspension represents a significant change in bilateral treaty dynamics.He added that Indian entities in Switzerland may face increased tax obligations, highlighting the challenges of managing international tax treaties in today's global context.Jhunjhunwala emphasised the importance of treaty partners agreeing on interpretation and application of tax treaty clauses for predictability and stability.AKM Global Tax Partner, Amit Maheshwari, explained that reciprocity drove the MFN withdrawal decision, aiming for equal treatment of taxpayers in both nations.Maheshwari noted that Swiss authorities had previously announced a reduction in dividend tax rates from 10 to 5 per cent, retroactive from July 5, 2018, but the 2023 Supreme Court ruling contradicted this position.He concluded that this could affect Swiss investments in India through higher dividend withholding, and from January 1, 2025, taxation may revert to original treaty rates, disregarding the MFN clause.JSA Advocates & Solicitors Partner Kumarmanglam Vijay indicated this would particularly affect Indian companies with ODI structures involving Swiss subsidiaries, increasing Swiss dividend withholding tax from 5 to 10 per cent from January 1, 2025.",The Swiss authorities have suspended the most favoured nation status (MFN) provision in the Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (DTAA) with India.

LAS VEGAS: Amazon's cloud unit AWS unveiled new AI models and chips to take on rivals like Microsoft, which has had an edge due to its ties with ChatGPT-maker OpenAI.Exactly two years ago, the launch of ChatGPT thrust Silicon Valley into the AI age, forcing tech giants to redraw plans and wiping out billions from market caps of companies that were slow to adapt. AWS, which pioneered renting out data infrastructure, was seen to be losing grip on its cloud dominance over the past two years amid the AI boom.However, Andy Jassy, who built AWS before succeeding Jeff Bezos as Amazon CEO in 2021, sees it differently. ""When we talk about AI, it is typically less to announce that we have beat the best chess player in the world... We are not using AI because we think it is cool. We are using it because we are trying to solve customer problems,"" Jassy said at AWS's annual tech event re:Invent in Las Vegas last week. AWS has sought to embed AI into its services and push customers to bring more of their applications by offering them a wide choice of AI models and chips, including its in-house ones, through its Bedrock platform.""With the announcement of Nova, we have made it clear that we want to compete... Whether it's chips or models, we will be very competitive on costs,"" Sherry Marcus, director of applied science (GenAI) at AWS, told TOI. Nova, which launched last week, is AWS's answer to AI foundation models like Google's Gemini and OpenAI's GPT-4o. Essentially, these are machine learning models trained on vast datasets and designed to produce a range of outputs, including chatbots.AI-related capabilities dominated AWS's announcements at the cloud conference.

The Nasdaq Composite Index achieved a historic milestone on Wednesday, reaching 20,000 for the first time, driven by enthusiasm surrounding artificial intelligence and anticipated interest rate reductions that propelled technology stocks to remarkable heights.The technology-focused index has risen over 33% this year, led by major tech firms including Apple, Nvidia, Alphabet, and recently Tesla. The gains on Wednesday followed a US inflation report that strengthened expectations for a Federal Reserve rate reduction next week.The index concluded Wednesday's trading at 20,034.89, representing a 1.8% daily increase.The current rally has benefited investors focused on growth and technology sectors, whilst raising concerns about elevated valuations and the increasing influence of large-capitalisation stocks within the index.""There is clearly an aspect of a chase into year-end, where the winners ... keep winning,"" stated Cameron Dawson, chief investment officer at NewEdge Wealth. ""The question is if this momentum can persist into 2025, where stretched valuations, positioning, sentiment, and growth expectations could all present high bars to jump over to keep above-average returns going.""Following its early 2020 decline during the pandemic-induced economic standstill, the index recovered swiftly as the Federal Reserve reduced interest rates to near-zero and the US government implemented substantial fiscal stimulus measures.The index experienced a significant decline in 2022, dropping 33% amidst 40-year high inflation rates and aggressive Federal Reserve rate increases. However, despite higher rates, the anticipated recession did not materialise, and the index has surged approximately 90% since then, partly due to growing enthusiasm about AI's commercial potential.Nvidia shares , whose chips are regarded as industry-leading, have increased more than 1,100% from their October 2022 low.""The AI story still rings true and appeals to investors,"" noted Alex Morris, chief investment officer of F/m Investments. ""These are the go-go stocks.""Despite the Nasdaq's increased valuation, it remains significantly below levels seen during the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s.The index currently trades at approximately 36 times earnings, a three-year peak exceeding its long-term average of 27, according to LSEG Datastream. This remains well below the roughly 70 times P/E ratio reached in March 2000, providing some reassurance to investors comparing the two periods.Large-capitalisation stocks increasingly dominate the index, with the top 10 companies representing 59% of the Nasdaq, compared to 45% in 2020. Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia hold the largest weightings at 11.7%, 10.6%, and 10.3% respectively.Whilst their rising share prices have boosted the Nasdaq, this concentration could pose risks should large technology companies lose favour. The 2022 downturn saw significant declines in major components, with Meta and Tesla falling 64% and 65% respectively.The Nasdaq has outperformed other major US indices this year, driven by substantial gains in heavily weighted companies like Nvidia, Amazon, and Meta Platforms. Its 33% increase in 2024 surpasses the S&P 500's 27% and Dow Jones Industrial Average's 17% gains.Over the past decade, the Nasdaq has gained over 320%, compared to the S&P 500's 200% and the Dow's 150% increase.(With inputs from agencies)","The Nasdaq Composite Index reached 20,000 for the first time on Wednesday.

NEW DELHI: More than 1.14 lakh startups in India have created over 12 lakh jobs so far, the finance ministry said in its latest review of the Indian economy .In the report titled, ‘The Indian Economy: A Review January 2024’, the Department of Economic Affairs said that the 1.14 lakh startups recognised by the government under the 'Startup India initiative’ created more than 12 lakh jobs (as of October 2023).The state-owned e-commerce platform Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) clocked more than 63 lakh transactions till November 2023, the document read.Despite facing global challenges in 2023 like valuation issues, few IPOs, regulatory changes and macroeconomic and geopolitical trends, India remains the third largest tech start-up ecosystem globally, with over 950 tech startups founded last year.The cumulative funding for more than 31,000 tech start ups has exceeded $70 billion (from 2019 to 2023), according to a recent report by Nasscom in collaboration with Zinnov.“In 2023, despite facing global economic and regulatory challenges, Indian tech startups have prioritised the imperative of enhancing their business fundamentals, driving profitability and growth,” said Debjani Ghosh, President, Nasscom.“The proliferation of tech startups in tier 2 and 3 cities marks the ecosystem's resilience,” she added.Navigating 2024, tech startup founders expect to continue the revenue growth path with measured steps focusing on optimising expenditure and maximising profitability for B2B tech startups.Investments in deeptech will continue an upward trend in 2024.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume.While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Bank Holidays September 2025: For those looking visit their bank branches on specific days in the upcoming month, it is important to note that several bank holidays could lead to extended weekends in some states. Planning ahead for your financial and branch-related work is advisable to avoid any inconvenience.All banks across India — both scheduled and non-scheduled — remain closed on the second and fourth Saturdays and all Sundays in general. Apart from these regular closures, a number of regional festivals and events will also be observed as holidays, according to RBI calendar.While physical branches will be closed on these days, customers can continue to use digital banking platforms including UPI, IMPS, NEFT, RTGS and ATMs without interruption.In September, major festivals such as Karma Puja, Onam, Id-e-Milad, Indrajatra, Navratra Sthapna and Durga Puja will impact bank operations in different states.However, since holidays differ across states, not every bank branch will be closed on the same day. For example, festivals such as Onam or Durga Puja are observed in certain regions and may not affect operations in others.

Customers are advised to check with their local branch for clarity before planning visits.","All banks across India — both scheduled and non-scheduled — remain closed on the second and fourth Saturdays and all Sundays in general.

The automobile industry has welcomed the GST Council’s decision to reduce tax rates on vehicles, calling it a timely step that will lift demand, make cars and two-wheelers more affordable, and particularly benefit first-time buyers and middle-income families.The new two-tier structure, announced on Wednesday, simplified levies to 5% and 18% from September 22, coinciding with the start of Navaratri.Industry leaders said the changes would inject fresh momentum into the sector and urged the government to quickly clarify rules on compensation cess on unsold vehicles to ensure a smooth transition.Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) President Shailesh Chandra said the industry is pleased with the decision to reduce GST on vehicles to 18% and 40%.“This timely move is set to bring renewed cheer to consumers and inject fresh momentum into the Indian automotive sector,” he told PTI.“Making vehicles more affordable, particularly in the entry-level segment; these announcements will significantly benefit first-time buyers and middle-income families, enabling broader access to personal mobility.”C S Vigneshwar, President of the Federation of Automobile Dealers’ Associations (FADA), described the changes as “bold and progressive reforms” that simplify the tax structure and create consensus across states.“This is a decisive step that will boost affordability, spur demand, and make India’s mobility ecosystem stronger and more inclusive,” he said. “As the country heads into the peak festive season, glitch-free and implementation will be the key to ensuring that the benefits seamlessly reach customers.”TVS Motor Company chairman Sudarshan Venu said the cut was a major move to turbocharge growth.“It will significantly boost consumption across segments of the society. For our industry especially, it is a welcome move as it will help two-wheelers become more accessible and also help those looking to upgrade,” he was cited by PTI.Chandra also welcomed the continuation of the 5% GST rate on electric vehicles, saying it “will help sustain the ongoing momentum towards sustainable mobility”. He added that resolving classification issues and correcting the inverted duty structure would streamline business processes and support ease of doing business.He further expressed confidence that “the government will also soon notify suitable mechanisms for the utilisation of compensation cess on unsold vehicles, ensuring a smooth and effective transition”.Vigneshwar expressed similar concern, pointing out that “one area that may need earliest clarification is about levy and treatment of cess balances currently lying in dealers’ books, so that there is no ambiguity during transition”.Under the revised slabs, petrol, LPG and CNG vehicles with engines up to 1,200 cc and under 4,000 mm in length, as well as diesel vehicles up to 1,500 cc and 4,000 mm, will be taxed at 18%, down from 28% plus cess.Motorcycles up to 350 cc will also be taxed at 18% instead of 28%, PTI reported.Larger vehicles – above 1,200 cc and longer than 4,000 mm – along with motorcycles above 350 cc and racing cars, will face a 40% levy. Small hybrid cars will benefit from lower rates, while electric vehicles will continue at the 5% slab.","The automobile industry has welcomed the GST Council’s decision to reduce tax rates on vehicles.

Stock market recommendations:Benchmark Indices witnessed a recovery in the first half of the current week and formed a high of 24,980 in Thursday session as the Government introduced significant changes to the GST structure aimed at boosting consumption. The earlier 12% and 28% tax slabs have been eliminated, with most items shifted into lower 5% and 18% brackets. In addition, a new 40% category has been created, which effectively absorbs the previous compensation cess, except for tobacco products. These revisions will be effective from 22 September.Indexes witnessed profit booking at higher levels around 25,000 levels on Thursday session and closed the session around 24,750 levels.Index in the immediate short term is likely to consolidate in the range of 24,400-25,000 amid stock specific actions. On the higher side a move above 25,000 levels will open further upside towards the key resistance area of 25,200-25,250 levels.Immediate support is placed at 24,400-24,337 levels being the confluence of the recent lows and the key retracement area. A breach below the same will signal acceleration of decline towards the key support area of 24,000-23,800 levels in the coming week being the confluence of the 52-week EMA and the previous major lows and the previous major breakout area.Bank Nifty is seen consolidating around 200 days EMA amid stock specific actions.Going ahead, we expect the index to move above Thursday's high (54,450) and open further upside towards a major breakdown area of 54,800-55,000. Overall, we expect the index to extend consolidation in the range 53,300-55,000 in the coming sessions.Bank Nifty has immediate support at 53,500-53,300 levels being the confluence of the 200 day EMA and the low of May 2025. A breach below the same will signal acceleration of decline towards the key support area of 52,500-52,000 levels in the coming weekThe stock after the recent corrective decline is forming base at the 200 day EMA and the previous breakout area thus offers fresh entry opportunity with favorable risk-reward set up.In the smaller time frame, it has generated a falling channel breakout containing the last 6 sessions corrective decline thus offers fresh entry opportunity. Strong support is placed in the range of 1290-1270 levels being the confluence of last month’s low and 200 days EMA.We expect stocks to head higher towards 1438 levels, being the 80% retracement of the previous July-August decline (1474-1291).The stock is in a strong up trend and is seen taking support at the 20 days EMA. We expect the stock to extend the up move thus offering a fresh entry opportunity.The stock has outperformed the overall market and is likely to extend its current outperformance.We expect the stock to head towards 67 levels in the coming month being the 123.6% external retracement of the previous decline (65-57).

Diwali Gift for Consumers: Govt Slashes GST Across Sectors, Prices to Drop from Sept 22





The central government’s revenue loss from the recent GST rate cuts is projected to be only around Rs 3,700 crore in FY26, cushioned by stronger consumption and higher tax collections, according to a report by the State Bank of India (SBI).As per news agency ANI, the report noted that while the government, based on FY24 estimates, had earlier projected a gross revenue loss of Rs 93,000 crore from GST rationalisation, higher collections reduced the net loss to Rs 48,000 crore.For FY26, SBI expects the gross loss to rise to Rs 1.11 lakh crore, but with buoyant consumption and better compliance, the net loss is seen sharply lower at Rs 25,794 crore, including Centre and states’ share.For the Centre alone, the loss is significantly smaller. Using the FY24 baseline, the Centre’s share was Rs 6,960 crore, while for FY26 it is projected at Rs 3,740 crore, SBI said. “Based on the trend growth and consumption boost, we expect Rs 3,700 crore revenue loss in GST,” the report added, noting the fiscal impact is just about 1 basis point of the deficit.SBI highlighted that past GST rate cuts have often led to additional revenues of nearly Rs 1 trillion.It argued the latest reforms should be viewed as structural rather than a temporary stimulus, as the simplified framework is expected to reduce compliance burdens, widen the tax base, and encourage voluntary compliance.On inflation, the report estimated that reducing GST rates on around 295 essential items, many now under 5% or Nil, would lower CPI inflation in this category by 25–30 basis points in FY26. Further, rationalisation in services is expected to ease CPI by another 40–45 basis points, taking the overall moderation to 65–75 bps over FY26–27.Experts said the reforms, part of GST 2.0 approved by the GST Council on September 3, reflect a shift to demand-led growth. Essentials will now attract 5%, other goods 18%, and luxury/sin items 40%.As per news agency PTI, HSBC Global Research said the combination of GST changes, income tax cuts and benign inflation will create conditions for “sustained growth,” with GDP rising by up to 0.2 ppt.Jefferies said the GST cuts would help both consumers and companies at a time of weak demand, while Kotak Institutional Equities noted they could revive FMCG consumption. Standard Chartered said the GST reduction could lower inflation by 40–60 bps annually, while adding 0.1–0.16 ppt to GDP growth.Overall, analysts expect the reforms to spur consumption in sectors including consumer goods, retail, automobiles, cement, insurance, and renewables, while also giving a push to private capex after years of sluggishness.","The central government’s revenue loss from the recent GST rate cuts is projected to be only around Rs 3,700 crore in FY26.

What is the overall message behind this GST reforms?

How do you see the implementation of rate cuts and will companies pass on the full benefit to consumers?

What kind of interventions are possible for sectors which are non-compliant or companies which are not?

Some sectors like insurance have expressed apprehensions about passing on the full benefits because of ITC being withdrawn...

One of the other concerns is with car dealers because of cess and GST now. Your views...

There is some lack of clarity on whether there is still scope for some levy beyond the 40% for certain sin goods like tobacco products?





NEW DELHI: FM Nirmala Sitharaman said Friday companies must pass on the benefit of lower GST rates to consumers while stating that the Centre is working on a package to provide relief to exporters affected by US tariffs.In an hour-long interview, Sitharaman told TOI the GST reforms, which came on PM Modi's directions, focused on ensuring the benefits of rate reduction go to the common man, farmers and small businesses. She said ministries were already working with the industry to ensure that the gains are fully transferred to consumers and pointed to several companies, such as state-run insurers and a leading Indian auto company, announcing plans to reduce prices.""We are keeping a close watch on prices and MPs have told me that they are doing so in their constituencies. Ministries are also in talks with the sectors concerned. From Sept 22, my entire focus will be on this,"" the FM said.The new rates will come into effect on Sept 22, the first day of Navratri, which marks the beginning of the month-long festival season that sees consumer spending surge.The FM expects that reduction in rates of 375 items, with just 13 goods and services now in the ""sin and luxury"" goods bracket, will offer a big boost to consumption and growth.She also said there will be stability in rates without frequent tinkering.Sitharaman acknowledged that some opposition-governed states had flagged ""revenue loss"" at the GST Council meeting, something which was at variance with their public position on rate cuts.""It's not true that only the revenue of states is getting affected, the Centre is also an equal stakeholder. Is it not a dharma sankat for me?... But when money flows into the pockets of the people, then should I only bother about my revenue? That is not possible,"" she said.Sanjay Kumar Agarwal, chairman of the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) explains the overall message of massive GST reforms undertaken by govt. In an interview to TOI, Agarwal says that companies must ensure that benefit of rate reduction is fully passed onto consumers. Excerpts:This transformational reform could take place because this exercise has been done from the heart. The only thing which was kept in mind was that it should lead to removal of litigation, a simplified GST and that the items used by the common man are subjected to lower tax so that they make savings. We have tried to take care of all segments - mass consumption, mass employment and also ensure certainty and stability to the businesses.The companies have to immediately take steps to update their systems so that the new rates are reflected. From Sept 22 the new rates should be picked up by their systems for generating invoices. Secondly, they have to ensure that rate cut benefits are passed on to consumers and they should not hold back any benefit s accrued due to this rate cut, with themselves. The department is closely monitoring price trends pre-cut and post-cut so that in case any kind of intervention is required, we will be ready to take that to ensure that benefits are ultimately passed on to consumers. But, we are otherwise confident that industries on their own will pass on the benefits. These kinds of assurances are being given by various chambers to us.For any sector which is not compliant, we will take the matter up with the industry body in that sector and point out that we are receiving these complaints against that particular industry and they may look into it. When they are making representation to us, it becomes their duty to look into it if any concern is flagged by the revenue department. This simplification of GST which has been done to bring only two rates will remove any kind of uncertainty about their liabilities, and they will now be certain that this is the rate which applies to them.If a policy is exempt, then input tax credit will not be available on inputs and input services, so that cost will get embedded, and to that extent they are right. But the revenue implication of providing the exemption, say Rs 8,000 crore, is the amount with which they were making payment in cash. They should completely pass that on to the policyholders. We understand the input tax credit part, but the relief which they are getting by way of revenue implication - is a huge amount - should be completely passed on to the policyholders.Compensation cess which has been paid, say on a car when it was cleared from the factory, can be utilised only for paying compensation cess. It cannot be utilised for payment of GST. If the compensation cess levy is withdrawn, then whatever credit is lying with them after that will remain in their books, and can't be utilised for GST payment.On cigarettes, pan masala, chewing tobacco, and other tobacco products - the current duty structure is continuing till the compensation cess collection is enough to make loan repayments. That may be till Dec. After that, the incidence of tax on these goods will not come down. GST will be at 40% and the rest will be filled by other measures. Whatever measures are required to maintain that level will be taken. Nobody will say that tax incidence on sin goods should come down."," FM Nirmala Sitharaman says companies must pass on the benefit of lower GST rates to consumers. She says the Centre is working on a package to provide relief to exporters affected by US tariffs. The new rates will come into effect on Sept 22, the first day of Navratri.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123728516,imgsize-24688,width-400,resizemode-4/nirmala-sitharaman.jpg"
Higher consumption to offset losses: Piyush Goyal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/higher-consumption-to-offset-losses-piyush-goyal/articleshow/123729068.cms,"



NEW DELHI: Commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal on Friday said any potential losses from GST rate rationalisation were accounted for and higher consumption would offset such losses.""With such a big reduction in the tax rate, imagine how much the market will increase and due to that increase, the tax will also increase,"" he said. The GST rate rationalisation has a fiscal implication of Rs 48,000 crore on FY23-24 consumption base, according to the finance ministry estimate.Goyal also talked about global trade developments concerning US tariffs and how it had nothing to do with the reforms. ""This decision has no link whatsoever with the decision of any country. Such a big change cannot happen overnight,"" he said, noting that the US decision was made only last month, while govt had been working on GST rates for many months.The minister has asked states to collect taxes honestly to safeguard revenues. He added that some items were kept at 5% instead of zero to protect input tax credits and avoid supply-chain issues. The finance ministry, he added, will soon spell out transitional arrangements for products already in the market before the GST rate deadline of Sept 22.Goyal said the rationalisation is historic and extensive, which would reduce prices of almost every product used by all sections of society and benefit every sector of the industry.The minister said it is the first time since independence that such a sweeping reform in indirect taxation has taken place, stating that ""big relief was given to consumers, simplification was done for the ease of doing business and a new hope for youth, farmers, women, and every consumer"".", Commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal said any potential losses from GST rate rationalisation were accounted for.

'GST reforms to ensure certainty for business',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gst-reforms-to-ensure-certainty-for-business/articleshow/123729059.cms,"What is the overall message behind this GST reforms?

How do you see the implementation of rate cuts and will companies pass on the full benefit to consumers?

What kind of interventions are possible for sectors which are non-compliant or companies which are not?

Some sectors like insurance have expressed apprehensions about passing on the full benefits because of ITC being withdrawn...

One of the other concerns is with car dealers because of cess and GST now. Your views...

There is some lack of clarity on whether there is still scope for some levy beyond the 40% for certain sin goods like tobacco products?





Sanjay Kumar Agarwal, chairman of the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) explains the overall message of massive GST reforms undertaken by govt. In an interview to TOI, Agarwal says that companies must ensure that benefit of rate reduction is fully passed onto consumers. Excerpts:This transformational reform could take place because this exercise has been done from the heart. The only thing which was kept in mind was that it should lead to removal of litigation, a simplified GST and that the items used by the common man are subjected to lower tax so that they make savings. We have tried to take care of all segments - mass consumption, mass employment and also ensure certainty and stability to the businesses.The companies have to immediately take steps to update their systems so that the new rates are reflected. From Sept 22 the new rates should be picked up by their systems for generating invoices. Secondly, they have to ensure that rate cut benefits are passed on to consumers and they should not hold back any benefit s accrued due to this rate cut, with themselves.The department is closely monitoring price trends pre-cut and post-cut so that in case any kind of intervention is required, we will be ready to take that to ensure that benefits are ultimately passed on to consumers. But, we are otherwise confident that industries on their own will pass on the benefits. These kinds of assurances are being given by various chambers to us.For any sector which is not compliant, we will take the matter up with the industry body in that sector and point out that we are receiving these complaints against that particular industry and they may look into it. When they are making representation to us, it becomes their duty to look into it if any concern is flagged by the revenue department. This simplification of GST which has been done to bring only two rates will remove any kind of uncertainty about their liabilities, and they will now be certain that this is the rate which applies to them.If a policy is exempt, then input tax credit will not be available on inputs and input services, so that cost will get embedded, and to that extent they are right. But the revenue implication of providing the exemption, say Rs 8,000 crore, is the amount with which they were making payment in cash. They should completely pass that on to the policyholders. We understand the input tax credit part, but the relief which they are getting by way of revenue implication - is a huge amount - should be completely passed on to the policyholders.Compensation cess which has been paid, say on a car when it was cleared from the factory, can be utilised only for paying compensation cess. It cannot be utilised for payment of GST. If the compensation cess levy is withdrawn, then whatever credit is lying with them after that will remain in their books, and can't be utilised for GST payment.On cigarettes, pan masala, chewing tobacco, and other tobacco products - the current duty structure is continuing till the compensation cess collection is enough to make loan repayments. That may be till Dec. After that, the incidence of tax on these goods will not come down. GST will be at 40% and the rest will be filled by other measures. Whatever measures are required to maintain that level will be taken. Nobody will say that tax incidence on sin goods should come down.","Sanjay Kumar Agarwal, chairman of the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) explains the overall message of massive GST reforms undertaken by govt.

India’s diesel exports to Europe surge

August Export Spike





The European Union’s new restrictions on Russia’s crude oil have led to a massive surge in diesel shipments from India. India's diesel shipments to Europe jumped 137% year-on-year, reaching 242,000 barrels per day (bpd) in August, as customers prepared for the European Union's upcoming restrictions on fuels processed from Russian crude starting January 2026.According to an ET report, the new rules could potentially restrict the market for Reliance Industries, India's primary processor of Russian oil and leading fuel exporter.Industry experts attributed this significant increase to several factors: an unexpected early maintenance schedule at a major refinery, anticipated winter requirements, and forthcoming EU regulations that might restrict Indian supplies. They anticipate European demand for Indian diesel to maintain strong levels throughout 2025.Also Read | The 50% misfire: How Trump made Russian oil cheaper for India - And Putin a winner According to Kpler, a global data and analytics service, August diesel exports to Europe increased 73% from last month and surpassed the past year's monthly average by 124%.Vortexa, another energy shipment monitoring firm, reported Indian diesel exports to Europe in August at 228,316 bpd, showing a 166% increase year-on-year and 36% growth from July.Different shipping data monitors often provide varying export figures.The surge in late August shipments, particularly to Rotterdam, seems to be compensating for the shortfall caused by unexpected refinery maintenance, Sumit Ritolia, lead research analyst, refining and modelling at Kpler was quoted as saying by ET. ""Exports rose sharply as Shell's Pernis (Netherlands) refinery advanced its planned turnaround from 2026. This has surprised the market,"" he said.One industry expert suggested that the early maintenance schedule could be a strategic move anticipating the post-January situation, when European markets may cease accepting Indian petroleum products refined from Russian crude.Also Read | 'One-sided' trade myth: Why Donald Trump is wrong - How US profits big from India US officials have strongly criticised India, alleging that its refineries are generating excessive profits by purchasing Russian crude at discounted rates and selling the processed products to Western nations, thus indirectly supporting Moscow's military operations.India has dismissed these allegations, stating that Western nations have the option to stop purchasing Indian fuel products if they have concerns.India's exporters anticipate robust demand from Europe throughout this year. ""European buyers may accelerate liftings from India given that Middle Eastern refineries will be having a high maintenance in October-November, echoing the stockpiling seen ahead of the February 2023 EU ban on Russian products,"" Ritola said.Europe relies heavily on Middle Eastern refineries as crucial suppliers.India's diesel exports witnessed a significant increase, reaching 603,000 bpd in August, showing an approximate 17% rise compared to both July and the previous year's figures, as reported by Kpler, primarily due to increased European shipments.The EU's July sanctions announcement stipulated that importers must present proof of crude origin used in refined products from third countries.

US President Donald Trump lashed out at the European Union on Friday for imposing a $3.5 billion antitrust fine on Google, calling it “unfair” and warning of retaliatory action if the bloc does not withdraw the penalty.“Europe today 'hit' another great American company, Google, with a $3.5 Billion Dollar fine, effectively taking money that would otherwise go to American Investments and Jobs,” Trump said in a post on Truth Social.“Very unfair, and the American taxpayer will not stand for it! As I have said before, my Administration will NOT allow these discriminatory actions to stand.”Trump added, “We cannot let this happen to brilliant and unprecedented American Ingenuity and, if it does, I will be forced to start a Section 301 proceeding to nullify the unfair penalties being charged to these Taxpaying American Companies.”His remarks came a day after he hosted Google chief executive Sundar Pichai and co-founder Sergey Brin at the White House, where he praised them for a US court decision rejecting the government’s attempt to force the sale of Google’s Chrome browser in a separate antitrust case.The European Commission had fined Google 2.95 billion euros ($3.5 billion) on Friday, ruling that the company abused its dominant position by favoring its own digital advertising services.Regulators also ordered the company to end “self-preferencing practices” and resolve “conflicts of interest” across the ad-tech supply chain.Google rejected the decision, saying it would appeal. “It imposes an unjustified fine and requires changes that will hurt thousands of European businesses by making it harder for them to make money,” said Lee-Anne Mulholland, the company’s global head of regulatory affairs.“There’s nothing anticompetitive in providing services for ad buyers and sellers, and there are more alternatives to our services than ever before,” she added.The EU ruling follows a three-year investigation launched in 2021. While regulators had raised the possibility of forcing a breakup of Google’s ad business, they stopped short of taking that step.The company also faces ongoing scrutiny in the United States, where the Justice Department has sought the divestment of its AdX and DFP platforms.",US President Donald Trump lashed out at the European Union on Friday for imposing a $3.5 billion antitrust fine on Google.

"Elon Musk package: Tesla board files $1 trillion Musk pay plan if 12 goals met; targets include robotaxis, AI bots",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/elon-musk-package-tesla-board-files-1-trillion-musk-pay-plan-if-12-goals-met-targets-include-robotaxis-ai-bots/articleshow/123720440.cms,"



Tesla CEO Elon Musk could be in line for a payout worth as much as $1 trillion if the electric carmaker meets a series of highly ambitious targets over the next decade, according to a regulatory filing released on Friday, the news agency AP reported.The proposed package includes a dozen share tranches linked to goals ranging from vehicle deliveries to market valuation. Tesla would need to hit a $2 trillion market cap, deliver 20 million cars, deploy one million robotaxis, and roll out one million AI-powered bots early in the plan. Musk must stay with the company for at least seven and a half years to cash out on any stock, and 10 years to receive the full amount.The filing also noted that the 11th and 12th tranches require Musk to present a framework for succession planning. The EV maker’s annual shareholders’ meeting is scheduled for November 6. At its last meeting in June 2024, investors restored Musk’s earlier $44.9 billion pay package that had been struck down by a Delaware court.The targets come as Tesla battles declining sales, intensifying competition from Detroit rivals and China’s BYD, and a sharp erosion in its European market share. The European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association reported Tesla sales in the EU plunged 40% year-on-year in July, dropping its market share to 0.7% while BYD rose to 1.1%.Tesla’s financials have also faltered. Quarterly profit fell to $409 million from $1.39 billion a year earlier, with revenue missing Wall Street’s lowered forecasts. Investors have expressed concern about Musk’s focus, with the billionaire spending much of this year in Washington as a prominent figure in President Donald Trump’s administration.Despite the turbulence, Tesla said the package was designed to “retain and incentivize Elon” and align his performance with shareholder value. Last month, Tesla awarded Musk a $29 billion stock grant as a “first step” in retaining him, even as a Delaware judge revoked his 2018 pay deal for a second time. Tesla has appealed the ruling.Tesla shares rose nearly 2% in premarket trading on Friday following the filing.","Tesla CEO Elon Musk could be in line for a payout worth as much as $1 trillion if the electric carmaker meets a series of highly ambitious targets over the next decade.

Japan Dumps Trump Before Modi Visit? Tokyo Walks Away From $550 Billion U.S. Trade Deal | Details





US President Donald Trump on Thursday signed an executive order implementing tariff cuts under an agreement with Japan announced in July, lowering duties on Japanese automobile imports and formalising a $550 billion investment pledge.According to news agency Reuters, the order reduces the tariff on Japanese autos from 27.5% to 15%, with the change taking effect within seven days of its publication in the Federal Register.The modifications will also apply retroactively to goods shipped from August 7, the date higher duties on dozens of economies took effect, as per news agency AFP.Other imports from Japan that previously faced tariffs above 15% will not be subject to an additional levy, while goods below that rate will be adjusted to 15%.Japan’s top negotiator Ryosei Akazawa welcomed the move, telling reporters in Washington that the step was a “steady implementation of the agreement reached on July 22.” Akazawa’s trip marked his 10th round of talks with US officials. “Finally,” he posted on X, signalling relief after months of negotiations.But he also cautioned that the 15% tariff would “still cause damage to our nation’s industries,” adding that Tokyo would take “swift and necessary measures, like financing assistance” to support affected sectors, as per AFP.According to Japan Today, the order also granted Japan “reciprocal” treatment on duties, correcting an earlier omission when similar provisions were extended to the EU.A memorandum of understanding was signed between Akazawa and US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick, covering Japan’s planned “strategic investments” in the United States. “This is historic,” Lutnick said at the signing.The deal commits Japan to invest $550 billion in US projects through equity, loans, and guarantees from state-backed banks, with Washington retaining authority to select projects.Trump has said the United States will keep 90 percent of the profits from these investments, which Japan clarified will largely consist of loans and loan guarantees.Investments will target critical sectors such as minerals, semiconductors, and pharmaceuticals.Trump said the inflows would “generate hundreds of thousands of US jobs, expand domestic manufacturing, and secure American prosperity for generations.”As part of the arrangement, Japan has agreed to increase its annual purchases of US agricultural goods, including corn, soybeans, and fertiliser, to $8 billion, along with a 75% rise in rice imports.The agreement also includes Japan buying 100 Boeing planes and lifting defence spending with US firms to $17 billion annually, up from $14 billion, Reuters noted.Toyota, which last month estimated a $10 billion hit from earlier US tariffs, praised the order for providing “much needed clarity.”While shares of Japanese automakers rose slightly on Friday, South Korean carmakers remained under pressure as Seoul awaits a similar executive order from Washington.The deal comes at a sensitive moment for Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, whose leadership faces a test with his ruling party set to vote on a possible extraordinary election.Analysts cited by Reuters said that while finalising the trade pact could strengthen Ishiba’s position, he still faces internal backlash over rising living costs and weak economic growth.","US President Donald Trump on Thursday signed an executive order implementing tariff cuts under an agreement with Japan announced in July.

US trade: Businesses front-load imports ahead of tariffs in July; deficit hits widest in 4 months,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-trade-businesses-front-load-imports-ahead-of-tariffs-in-july-deficit-hits-widest-in-4-months/articleshow/123702976.cms,"FIEO chief warns 50% US tariff hits over half of exports, MSMEs staring at crisis





The US trade gap widened sharply in July, hitting its largest level in four months, as businesses rushed in imports ahead of fresh tariffs from US President Donald Trump.Figures from the department of commerce on Thursday showed the deficit rose by 32.5% to $78.3 billion. Imports jumped 5.9% to $358.8 billion, while exports increased only slightly, up 0.3% to $280.5 billion.""While imports bounced back in July, more than half of the increase was due to gold as trade policy and safe-haven demand brought about a resurgence in trade,"" said Matthew Martin, senior economist at Oxford Economics told AFP.""Excluding gold, imports rose by a more modest 3.3%, while exports fell 0.1%,"" Martin added.Pantheon Macroeconomics analysts described the widening shortfall as the result of ""another wave of pre-tariff stockpiling.""Trump initially introduced a 10% tariff on most trading partners in April. Plans to raise these levies were postponed twice before taking effect in early August, affecting key allies such as the European Union, Japan and India.Economists believe businesses that front-loaded imports are now running low on existing stocks, meaning they will soon face higher costs when they place new orders.For now, however, the broader impact on inflation in the US remains limited.A Briefing.com poll of forecasters had expected the deficit to come in much smaller, at $64.2 billion.Martin noted that strong demand for capital goods linked to artificial intelligence and data centres had also pushed up imports. The Commerce Department added that inflows of industrial supplies and consumer goods both rose strongly.Trade with China played a significant role, with the US goods deficit widening by $5.3 billion to $14.7 billion in July.""Unsurprisingly, given the level of tariffs, China has been the hardest hit of all trading partners,"" Martin said. Goods from the world’s second-largest economy are now subject to an additional 30% tariff this year, while other Asian nations face lower rates.Trump’s tariff strategy has rattled global supply chains, with import surges recorded as early as March, before his wide-ranging duties began in April. Alongside general tariffs, Washington has also imposed separate charges on steel, aluminium and automobiles, with the White House signalling that more measures are still to come.","Imports jumped 5.9% to $358.8 billion, while exports increased only slightly.

US job market: Jobless benefit applications see slight increase; America maintains 'no hire no fire' pace,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-job-market-jobless-benefit-applications-see-slight-increase-america-maintains-no-hire-no-fire-pace/articleshow/123702359.cms,"



The number of Americans applying for unemployment benefits increased slightly last week, reflecting that employers are retaining workers despite the economy showing signs of slowing down.According to the figures released by the US labour department on Thursday, for the week ending 30 August, jobless claims rose by 8,000 to 237,000. The rise was higher than the 231,000 applications economists had predicted.Unemployment benefit claims are often seen as an indicator of layoffs, and they have mostly stayed within a healthy range of 200,000 to 250,000 since the US emerged from the pandemic almost four years ago.Despite layoffs remaining relatively low, hiring has weakened, with economists calling it a “no hire, no fire” economy. The jobless rate remains low at 4.2%.New government data earlier this week showed employers had 7.2 million job vacancies at the end of July, fewer than expected and another sign of labour market weakness.Last month’s disappointing July jobs report, which recorded only 73,000 new positions and revised previous months sharply down, unsettled financial markets.In its wake, US President Donald Trump dismissed the head of the agency responsible for compiling the monthly figures.Attention is now turning to the August employment report, due on Friday. Economists expect employers to have added around 80,000 private non-farm jobs. Wall Street and the Federal Reserve are watching closely, as recent figures suggest hiring has slowed dramatically since spring.Over the past three months, job creation has averaged just 35,000 a month, about a quarter of last year’s pace. Businesses have been pulling back on expansion plans amid uncertainty over Trump’s tariff policies, contributing to a broader slowdown.The economy expanded at an annual rate of 1.3% in the first half of 2025, compared with 2.5% last year.Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell has already indicated that interest rates could be cut at the central bank’s next meeting on 16–17 September to ease borrowing costs on mortgages, car finance and business loans.Thursday’s report also showed the four-week moving average of claims rose by 2,500 to 231,000. The total number of people receiving unemployment benefits for the week ending 23 August slipped by 4,000 to 1.94 million.","Jobless claims rose by 8,000 to 237,000 in the week ending 30 August.

Wall Street traded in green on Thursday as pressure from the bond market eased and investors closely watched signs of weakness in the US labour market.The S&P 500 gained 0.17% or 10 points to reach 6,459. Dow Jones Industrial Average began the day in red but jumped 54 points or 0.12%, trading at 45,325 at 7.55 PM IST. Nasdaq followed the suit, jumping to 21,524, rising 0.13% or 27 points.Treasury yields eased following discouraging signals on jobs, with reports pointing to weaker hiring among private employers last month and a potential rise in layoffs last week.Neither report signalled towards a recession, but a cooling jobs market could prompt the Federal Reserve to cut its main interest rate for the first time this year in the coming weeks. A more comprehensive employment report is due on Friday.Shares of American Eagle Outfitters surged 26% after the teen fashion retailer posted more than double Wall Street’s expected second-quarter profit late Wednesday. The company benefitted from intense media attention in late July over its deliberately provocative campaign featuring 27-year-old actor Sydney Sweeney.Google gave back a fraction of Wednesday’s 9.1% rally, slipping less than 1% before the bell.The tech giant had jumped after avoiding some of the worst-case scenarios in its antitrust trial.Later Thursday, the government is set to release its latest weekly layoffs data, paving the way for the crucial August jobs report on Friday. On Wednesday, official figures showed that US employers had 7.2 million job openings at the end of July, fewer than economists expected, marking another sign of a weakening labour market.The deteriorating outlook has bolstered expectations that the Fed will lower rates at its meeting later this month. Last month’s July jobs report, which included sharp downward revisions for June and May, rattled markets and led President Donald Trump to sack the head of the agency responsible for compiling the figures.Lower interest rates could help shore up both the labour market and the wider economy, but the risk remains that easing policy could stoke inflation at a time when Trump’s tariffs may already be pushing up the cost of imports.In Europe, Germany’s DAX climbed 0.8% by midday, while London’s FTSE 100 edged up 0.2% and the CAC 40 in Paris slipped 0.1%.Asian markets were largely positive.

Putin Lashes Out At German Chancellor After ‘War Criminal’ Jibe Amid Ukraine Truce Delay





Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday dismissed the Ukraine conflict as a mere “pretext” used by Western powers to impose broader punitive measures against countries engaged in strong economic relations with Moscow.Speaking to the media after concluding a four-day visit to China, Putin argued that recent trade restrictions and tariffs were being justified under the Ukraine narrative but, in reality, pursued unrelated political and economic agendas.“The Ukraine situation is only a pretext to take various steps against countries that have economic ties with us,” he said, according to ANI.He pointed to tariffs imposed on Brazil earlier in August as an example of trade penalties that had no direct link to the Ukraine conflict. Putin said the actual reasons behind these measures were economic imbalances between the West, particularly the United States and major economies like India, China and Brazil.“There is a trade disproportion between the United States and India or with China, but there is no situation between Brazil and the United States, for example. And, by the way, Brazil faced additional tariffs on the 6th of August, even though the deadline was the 8th of August.So what does Ukraine have to do with this? Nothing. It's only about domestic politics... Ukraine doesn't have anything to do with that. So, of course, there is some imbalance in trade, but I believe that those should be addressed through negotiations,"" the Putin added.The Russian President’s remarks come at a time when Washington’s tariff policies have heightened global trade tensions. India, in particular, faces uncertainty after the US imposed a 50 per cent tariff on imports, alongside an additional 25 per cent linked to its purchase of Russian crude oil.Washington has argued that India’s crude imports indirectly support Moscow’s war effort.In the same press briefing, Putin also said he remained open to meeting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, provided such a meeting was well-prepared and aimed at achieving a constructive outcome. “If Zelenskyy is ready, he can come to Moscow. This is quite possible,” he said, while reiterating Moscow’s opposition to Ukraine’s Nato membership but showing less resistance to its European Union ambitions.Meanwhile, frustration has been rising in Europe over Moscow’s stance. As per news agency AFP, European leaders are gathering in Paris with Ukrainian President Zelenskyy to push for stronger security guarantees for Kyiv, warning that Russia remains unwilling to strike a peace deal.French President Emmanuel Macron said allies were ready to offer guarantees “the day that a peace accord is signed,” while Ukraine’s foreign minister dismissed Putin’s Moscow invitation as “knowingly unacceptable.”","Vladimir Putin dismisses Ukraine conflict as a mere “pretext” used by Western powers to impose punitive measures against countries engaged in strong economic relations with Moscow.

‘Much more needs to be done’: COP30 finance goal far behind with just 4-5% achieved; experts urge urgent action by 2030,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/much-more-needs-to-be-done-cop30-finance-goal-far-behind-with-just-4-5-achieved-experts-urge-urgent-action-by-2030/articleshow/123674313.cms,"AI image





The global funding target set for COP30 is far behind schedule, with only 4-5 per cent of the promised $1.3 trillion achieved so far, claimed Vishwas Chitale, Fellow, Climate Resilience at the Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW).In an exclusive interview to news agency ANI, Chitale stressed that the $1.3 trillion target is crucial for climate action, yet progress has been slow. “Around 4-5 per cent of the target of 1.3 trillion dollar is achieved. We are really lagging behind the target. All the developing countries are supposed to contribute by 2030,” he said, while adding that if COP30 accelerates its efforts, the goal remains achievable.Chitale underlined that the momentum of climate finance remains largely dependent on developed nations, which have been the main contributors so far. “There is funding from developed countries for developing countries. Developing countries should stand for their commitments,” he pointed out.He explained that COP30 is not only focused on finance but also on broader synergies, including Rio synergies, climate action, and community resilience.“As a whole we can improve the land use and land cover practices. The main agenda is how COP30 delivers on the climate finance of $1.3 trillion and can we see some action happening on that,” he said.Recalling previous progress, Chitale said that while the loss and damage fund initiated at COP27 saw movement at the Dubai COP, “much more needs to be done to translate commitments into action, especially to meet the 2030 target.”On India’s role, he noted that the country has emerged as a strong voice for the Global South, leading negotiations on adaptation finance and resilience. He highlighted initiatives like the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure (CDRI), the Prime Minister’s ten-point agenda on disaster reduction, and Mission Life, describing them as “excellent steps.”Earlier, Andre Aranha Correa do Lago, President of COP30, was quoted by ANI as saying that developed countries carry “more responsibility” for climate change, having been responsible for carbon dioxide accumulation “for more than 250 years.”He stressed that Brazil and India, as part of the BASIC group, have been united in their negotiations, with both emerging economies expected to play a key role at COP30 in Belem this November.A Moody’s report, which came out earlier this year, had also warned that many governments are falling short of the Paris Agreement’s climate targets, with delays pushing countries to prioritise adaptation and resilience investments.The report flagged risks of a “climate investment trap” for emerging markets if funding gaps persist.Chitale concluded that more awareness and concrete action are needed to accelerate climate finance delivery. “It has a lot to deliver on that,” he said, pointing to COP30’s responsibility to ensure progress on both funding and resilience building.","Only 4-5 per cent of the promised $1.3 trillion has been achieved, claims Vishwas Chitale, Fellow, Climate Resilience at the Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW) The momentum of climate finance remains largely dependent on developed nations, which have been the main contributors.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123674345,imgsize-329111,width-400,resizemode-4/thriving-community-climate-resilience.jpg"

'Respect India Or West Will Lose': NATO Ally Finland President Stubb Warns Trump Amid Tariff War

Trump’s tariff plan for pharma





US President Donald Trump is mulling tariffs on the pharmaceutical sector - as high as 200%! Trump intends to levy substantial import duties on pharmaceutical products, a sector that has largely remained unaffected by his trade policies. Historically, imported medicines have entered the United States without customs duties.Recent developments indicate a shift in this approach. A trade agreement between the US and European nations has established a 15% tariff on certain European imports, including pharmaceutical products. Trump has indicated potential duties exceeding 200% on medications produced in other regions.PwC's tax specialist Maytee Pereira characterises Trump's pharmaceutical strategy by stating: ""Shock and awe. This is an industry that's going from zero (tariffs) to the potentiality of 200%,” Maytee Pereira told AP.The proposal to reduce drug costs for Americans through pharmaceutical tariffs could have unintended consequences. Such measures might actually increase prices, create supply chain complications, reduce access to affordable foreign-made generic medications, and lead to medicine shortages, according to the AP report.""A tariff would hurt consumers most of all, as they would feel the inflationary effect ... directly when paying for prescriptions at the pharmacy and indirectly through higher insurance premiums,'' Diederik Stadig, a healthcare economist with the financial services firm ING, wrote in a commentary last month, adding that lower-income households and the elderly would feel the greatest impact.This initiative coincides with ongoing pressure on pharmaceutical companies to reduce prices in the United States. Letters have been sent to various companies requesting plans for implementing most-favoured nation pricing domestically.However, the proposed tariffs include a grace period of 12 to 18 months, allowing pharmaceutical companies to build inventory reserves and relocate production facilities to the United States, actions some firms have already initiated.According to Leerink Partners analyst David Risinger's July 29 note, numerous pharmaceutical companies have increased their drug imports and maintained six to 18 months of stock within the United States.The financial expert David Windley from Jefferies indicated in his analysis that the impact of proposed tariffs scheduled for late 2026 might not be noticeable until 2027 or 2028, as companies would likely build up inventory.Industry observers anticipate that Trump would likely implement a tariff significantly below 200%. They are also observing whether specific products, particularly low-margin generic medications, would receive exemptions from these tariffs.According to Stadig's assessment, even a modest 25% tariff would result in a gradual increase of 10% to 14% in US pharmaceutical prices once existing stocks are depleted.Pharmaceutical companies have increasingly relocated their operations abroad over the past several decades, seeking cost advantages in China and India, whilst benefiting from tax incentives in Ireland and Switzerland. This shift has contributed to a substantial US trade deficit in pharmaceutical products, approaching £150 billion in the previous year.The global health crisis during COVID-19 highlighted the vulnerabilities of depending on international sources for medical supplies, particularly when nations prioritised their domestic needs. This situation became especially concerning when considering China, a significant supplier and strategic competitor to America.In April, the US government initiated an investigation into the national security implications of pharmaceutical imports. Under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, the president holds authority to impose tariffs when national security concerns arise.Health policy analyst Marta Wosińska at the Brookings Institution advocates for tariffs to protect US medical supplies. She highlighted how the Biden administration's taxation on foreign syringes protected US manufacturers from inexpensive Chinese imports.Trump advocates for relocating pharmaceutical manufacturing to the United States, suggesting US-manufactured drugs would be exempt from his proposed tariffs.Pharmaceutical companies are increasing their US investments. In April, Roche, the Swiss pharmaceutical company, announced a $50 billion expansion of its US operations. Johnson & Johnson plans to invest $55 billion in the United States over four years. Their CEO Joaquin Duato indicated plans to exclusively manufacture US market drugs within the country.However, establishing new pharmaceutical facilities in the United States requires substantial investment and extended time periods.Furthermore, US-based manufacturing might still face tariff implications if imported ingredients are taxed. According to Jacob Jensen, trade policy analyst at the American Action Forum, ""97% of antibiotics, 92% of antivirals and 83% of the most popular generic drugs contain at least one active ingredient that is manufactured abroad.""The complete protection against tariffs requires establishing the entire supply chain within the United States, according to Pereira.Whilst branded pharmaceutical companies maintain substantial profit margins allowing them to handle investments and tariff costs, generic manufacturers operate with limited financial flexibility.Several generic manufacturers might exit the US market due to tariff pressures. This poses significant concerns as generics constitute 92% of US retail and mail-order pharmacy prescriptions.A temporary production halt at an Indian facility previously resulted in chemotherapy shortages, affecting cancer treatment. ""Those are not very resilient markets,"" Brookings' Wosińska said. ""If there's a shock, it's hard for them to recover.""Wosińska contends that tariffs alone cannot convince generic manufacturers to establish US-based facilities without governmental financial support.""In an ideal world, we would be making everything that's important only in the US,'' Wosińska said. ""But it costs a lot of money ... We have offshored so much of our supply chains because we want to have inexpensive drugs. If we want to reverse this, we would really have to redesign our system ... How much are we willing to spend?''","US President Donald Trump is mulling tariffs on the pharmaceutical sector. Trump intends to levy substantial import duties on pharmaceutical products.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Space sector start-up Sisir Radar to develop SAR on L/P band SAR,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/space-sector-start-up-sisir-radar-to-develop-sar-on-l/p-band-sar/articleshow/104558111.cms,"CHENNAI: Space sector startup, Sisir Radar Private Ltd has hit success at the prestigious iDEX DefSpace Challenge with its projects for development of “L/P band Continuous Wave SAR (synthetic aperture radar) payload for LEO Small Satellites” and “Unfurlable, Electronically Steering Antenna for L/P band SAR payload” for Indian Air Force (IAF), said a top company official.The company is promoted by former Director at the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) Tapan Misra and the brains behind the Indian space agency’s RISAT series of SAR satellites as well as the Dual Frequency SAR on the Chandrayaan 2 orbiter that is currently circling the moon.""A grant of Rs 3 crore is also there for development of the products,"" Misra told IANS.Synthetic Aperture Radar or SAR is a special kind of imaging radar technology that can provide extremely accurate high resolution imagery of the terrain through clouds, smoke and dust even in pitch dark conditions. SAR imagery provides much higher resolution than other forms of remote sensing technology such as hyperspectral and multispectral. SAR is a critical technology for strategic reconnaissance and planning as well as for disaster management.According to Misra, winning the challenge in just over a year of floating the company is a major booster.He said L and P band SAR have an advantage over other frequencies (like X band) when it comes to penetration capabilities through rain, clouds, foliage and vegetation in a tropical country like India, and underground penetration capabilities in dry terrain.Continuing further, he said the L band SAR will provide 1 metre resolution, spotlight resolution in Stripmap mode. The current industry standard is 5-10 metre in L band. Misra said both the L and P band will operate simultaneously from a satellite borne SAR. Recently, Sisir Radar successfully developed and tested the world’s highest resolution L-Band SAR fitted on a drone. With 0.2 metre resolution, this is by far the highest L band SAR in the world, he said.","Space sector startup, Sisir Radar Private Ltd has hit success at the prestigious iDEX DefSpace Challenge. The company is promoted by former Director at the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) Tapan Misra and the brains behind the Indian space agency’s RISAT series of SAR satellites.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-104558088,imgsize-2534,width-400,resizemode-4/SISIRRADAR.jpg"

ITR filing FY 2024-25: New ITR-1 form notified with major changes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/taxation/itr-filing-fy-2024-25-new-itr-1-form-notified-with-major-changes-heres-what-taxpayers-should-know/articleshow/120785747.cms,"ITR filing: For individuals and those not requiring account audits, the submission deadline remains July 31.

ITR-1 for income tax return FY 2024-25:

Salaried individuals and those under the presumptive taxation scheme can now file ITR-1 and ITR-4 respectively if their long-term capital gains (LTCG) are within Rs 1.25 lakh per fiscal year. Previously, these categories were required to file ITR-2.

According to I-T regulations, LTCG up to Rs 1.25 lakh from listed shares and mutual funds remains tax-exempt. Any gains above Rs 1.25 lakh annually attract a 12.5 per cent tax.

Similar to the previous version, ITR-1 requires individuals to provide information about foreign travel expenses surpassing Rs 2 lakh for themselves or others.

Additionally, it requires disclosure of electricity consumption costs exceeding Rs 1 lakh during the previous fiscal period.

What does the new ITR-1 mean for taxpayers?

New ITR forms for FY 2024-25: The Income Tax Department has issued a new ITR-1 and ITR-4 for tax filing purposes for the assessment year 2025-26, simplifying the process for individuals with long term capital gains up to Rs 1.25 lakh from listed equities.The forms include modifications regarding deductions under sections 80C, 80GG and others, featuring a drop down menu in the utility. Additionally, taxpayers must provide detailed section-wise information for TDS deductions.Tax filing can commence once the I-T department releases the utility for the 2024-25 fiscal year. For individuals and those not requiring account audits, the submission deadline remains July 31.Typically, ITR forms are released before the fiscal year ends, around February/March. This year's delay in form notification and filing utility occurred because revenue department officials were engaged with the new Income Tax Bill, presented to Parliament in February.Also Check | Latest income tax slabs FY 2025-26: What are the new income tax slabs, rates after Budget 2025 announcements? Check new vs old tax regime comparison - FAQs answered ITR Form 1 Sahaj is available for resident individuals with yearly earnings up to Rs 50 lakh, receiving income through salary, single property ownership, additional sources (interest) and farming revenue not exceeding Rs 5,000 annually.According to Samir Kanabar, Tax Partner at EY India, this move reflects a clear shift towards enhancing taxpayer services by allowing individual taxpayers to file simplified tax return where they have long-term capital gains up to Rs 1.25 lacs.“Thereby, it removes the burden of navigating more complex forms. The change is expected to encourage greater voluntary compliance, reduce filing-related stress, and make the system more inclusive and user-friendly for small taxpayers. We hope that this is just the beginning towards better compliance and simplification and expect more to come,” he said.“Forms ITR-1 and ITR-4 for Assessment Year 2025-26 remain largely consistent with the previous year. Notably, the updated forms bring relief to individuals with long-term capital gains taxable under Section 112A of the Income Tax Act provided these gains do not exceed the threshold of ₹1.25 lakhs, as earlier such taxpayers had to file return in ITR 2/ITR 3, which are more detailed forms. This is a welcome move by the Government and marks a positive step toward improving taxpayer services by allowing individuals within this category to file a simplified return which was not allowed till last year,” says Divya Baweja, Partner, Deloitte India.Sandeep Jhunjhunwala, Tax Partner at Nangia Andersen LLP stated that previously, salaried individuals with capital gains income needed to file ITR-2, even when these gains were exempt under Section 112A's threshold limit, necessitating comprehensive disclosures including capital gain accrual or receipt information and securities details.Also Read | Save up to Rs 1.1 lakh! How income tax slab changes will benefit taxpayers at different salary levels under new regime The new ITR-1 form for AY 2025-26 has been modified to include a dedicated portion for reporting LTCG income that is tax-exempt within the limits specified under Section 112A, thus reducing filing complications.""However, in cases, where the taxpayer earns LTCG under Section 112A in excess of Rs 125,000 or where the taxpayer earns any other LTCG other than that taxable under Section 112A or earns short term capital gains or has carried forward or brought forward capital losses or derived income from any combination of the above, the salaried individual would have to resort to Form ITR-2 for filing return of income,"" Jhunjhunwala said.",ITR-1 for income tax return FY 2024-25: Salaried individuals and those under presumptive taxation scheme can now file ITR-1 and I TR-4 respectively if their long-term capital gains (LTCG) are within Rs 1.25 lakh per fiscal year.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120786002,imgsize-40994,width-400,resizemode-4/120786002.jpg"

GST kitty grows 12.6% to scale new high in April,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gst-kitty-grows-12-6-to-scale-new-high-in-april/articleshow/120805193.cms,"GST figs show economy’s resilience: FM



New Delhi: GST collections grew by 12.6% - the fastest pace of expansion in 17 months - to reach a record Rs 2,36,716 crore in April, buoyed by an over 20% jump in mop-up from imports.Collections from domestic sources were 10.7% higher at a little under Rs 1.9 lakh crore, while gross import revenue rose to Rs 47,000 crore, up 20.8%. Refunds soared 48.3% to Rs 27,341 crore. On a net basis, collections rose 9% to Rs 2,09,376 crore.Appreciating the efforts of officers, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said, “The figures showcase the resilience of Indian economy and effectiveness of cooperative federalism. Deepest gratitude to the taxpayers whose contributions and faith in the GST architecture drive the nation’s progress. Their contributions reflect a shared commitment to building a Viksit Bharat. Congratulations and sincere regards to the dedicated efforts finance ministers of all states and state GST authorities, who remain equal partners in India’s GST framework. ”Collections in April, based on transactions in March, are typically the highest as companies rush to meet year-end targets. “The record GST collections underscore the Indian economy’s underlying strength in the face of global economic uncertainties.Govt’s proactive measures to accelerate exports and other GST refunds have eased the working capital burden on industries, a benefit likely to translate to consumers over the medium to long term. The notable GST figures for April may have also been positively influenced by substantial exports to the US market prior to the announcement of reciprocal tariffs. While a potential moderation in absolute GST collections is anticipated next month due to the current global economic climate, the overall outlook for the Indian economy remains optimistic,” said EY India tax partner Saurabh Agarwal.Experts also drew comfort from the growth being evenly spread out. Meghalaya reported a massive 50% jump in collections, while Andhra Pradesh, with a 3% decline, was at the other end of the spectrum.“Collections have been uniformly high in all major producing/ consuming states and have been in the range 11% to 16%... It is interesting to note that there are more than five states, including UP, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, having more than 10 lakh GST registrations... These states account for the bulk of the GST collections,” said MS Mani of Deloitte India.","Collections from domestic sources were 10.7% higher at a little under Rs 1.9 lakh crore.

Gold loans double in a year even as credit growth slows,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gold-loans-double-in-a-year-even-as-credit-growth-slows/articleshow/120805037.cms,"Mumbai: Indians are pledging more gold than ever. Outstanding bank loans against the precious metal more than doubled in the year to March 2025, rising 103% from just over Rs 1 lakh crore to nearly Rs 2.1 lakh crore, RBI data showed. The surge made gold loans the fastest-growing segment, even as overall bank credit growth slowed to 11% in FY25 from 20% in the previous year.Several forces drove this boom. In 2023, RBI directed banks to reclassify many agricultural loans as loans against gold jewellery, inflating the numbers. Typically, banks benefit by categorising rural gold-backed loans as agricultural credit as farm loans carry lower interest rates and relatively lenient repayment terms.Further impetus came after RBI restricted gold lending by a few large non-bank finance companies, pushing more borrowers towards traditional banks. A steep rise in gold prices also enhanced borrowing capacity, as lenders offer funds against the value of jewellery pledged.Despite the spike in gold loans, overall credit expansion lost steam. Outstanding bank credit stood at Rs 182 trillion at the end of March 2025.While the merger of HDFC with HDFC Bank distorted the base, even adjusted growth slowed to 12% from 16.3% in the previous year. Large industry remained a drag, with credit growth to the sector dipping slightly to 6.2% from 6.4% in FY24.The composition of bank lending continued to shift. Industry's share fell further to 21.5%, while services rose to 28.3%. Personal loans accounted for 32.6% of all credit, up marginally from 32.4%, helped by the jump in gold loans. The share of housing loans remained steady at 16.5%. Loans against gold jewellery now make up 1.1% of total bank credit, nearly doubling their share from 0.6% a year ago.Besides gold loans, the second fastest-growing segment was loans against securities, which grew 18.7% to Rs 10,080 crore. Consumer durables were the only category in the retail segment to see a dip, shrinking 1.3% to Rs 23,402 crore. This drop was largely because many lenders reviewed their exposure to unsecured personal loans. Housing loans accounted for 16.5% of personal loans with a portfolio of Rs 30.1 lakh crore. 'Other personal loans', which largely reflect unsecured loans, grew by 7.9%.","Outstanding bank loans against the precious metal rose 103% from just over Rs 1 lakh crore to nearly Rs 2.1 lakh crore.

NEW DELHI: Due to Pakistan's closure of its airspace to Indian carriers, Air India anticipates additional expenses of approximately $600 million if Pakistan's airspace restriction continues for a year, and has requested compensation from the central government, according to a company letter obtained by Reuters.Indian airlines are preparing for increased fuel expenses and extended flight durations due to Pakistan's closure of airspace following a terror attack on tourists in Kashmir's Pahalgam last week that killed 26 including a foreign national from Nepal.On Sunday, Air India reportedly submitted a request to the Indian government for a 'subsidy model' corresponding to the financial impact, calculating losses exceeding 50 billion Indian rupees ($591 million) annually whilst the restriction remains in effect, as per Reuters, that claims to have viewed the letter sent to the civil aviation ministry.""Subsidy for affected international flights is a good, verifiable and fair option ... the subsidy can be removed when the situation improves,"" the letter stated. ""The impact on Air India is maximum due to airspace closure, due to additional fuel burn...additional crew.""The correspondence was issued after government officials requested Air India executives to evaluate the consequences of the airspace restriction on Indian carriers, according to a Reuters source.The Tata Group-owned carrier, currently implementing a multi-billion dollar restructuring following state ownership, faces growth limitations due to delayed aircraft deliveries from Boeing and Airbus.The airline recorded a net loss of $520 million in fiscal 2023-2024, with revenues of $4.6 billion.Air India, holding 26.5% market share in India, services routes to Europe, the United States and Canada, frequently utilising Pakistan's airspace. The airline operates significantly more long-distance routes compared to its domestic competitor IndiGo.According to Cirium Ascend data, IndiGo, Air India and Air India Express collectively scheduled approximately 1,200 flights from New Delhi to Europe, the Middle East and North America in April.India is exploring solutions to minimise the impact on the aviation sector from Pakistan's airspace closure. One Reuters source indicated that Indian carriers consulted with the civil aviation ministry to develop alternatives, including routes over challenging terrain near China and potential tax relief measures.Air India's letter requested government intervention with Chinese authorities regarding specific overflight permissions, without providing details. Additionally, it sought approval for deploying extra pilots on United States and Canada routes to accommodate increased journey times.",Air India anticipates additional expenses of approximately $600 million if Pakistan's airspace restriction continues for a year.

"Lend, baby, lend: Borrowers getting younger",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/lend-baby-lend-borrowers-getting-younger/articleshow/120804563.cms,"MUMBAI: When HDFC began offering home loans in the late 1970s, credit was a privilege, accessed cautiously and late in life. A large downpayment was a prerequisite, and only those in their 40s, with years of savings, could typically afford to borrow. Today, credit is accessed much earlier and more casually, with a growing number of Indians starting their credit journey in their mid-20s.The average age at which Indians avail their first credit product has fallen by 21 years across three generations, a study by Paisabazaar showed. K Cherian Varghese, former chairman of Corporation Bank, who began his banking career five decades ago says that the ability to borrow is directly linked to the size of disposable income. "" Personal loans are taken either to finance purchase of some asset like home loan or for consumption. In the 70s, the disposable income was not enough to service the loan EMIs. Today, in many jobs like IT, the employees get a decent salary that allows them to meet all expenses and repay their EMIs,"" said Varghese. He adds that today banks have pre-approved many corporate employers and are willing to provide a suite of credit products to their employees making credit much more accessible.While the credit bureau made it easier for lenders to identify delinquents, the Jan Dhan-Aadhaar-Mobile trinity made it easier to keep track of borrowers. The study, which is based on the credit behaviour of over 10 million consumers, showed that those born in the 1960s began borrowing at 47, largely through secured loans like mortgages. In contrast, individuals born in the 1990s typically enter the credit ecosystem by the age of 25-28, often through unsecured products such as credit cards, personal loans, and consumer durable loans.This shift reflects the broader trend of easier access to credit and a changing consumer mindset - one that values instant gratification over prolonged savings. While the first credit card in India was launched by Central Bank with Mastercard in the early 80s, it was a very highly restricted product. The card was offered largely to tax-paying high earners. It wasn't until Citi, SBI and ICICI started offering cards to a wider audience that cards picked up.The study traces how the entry point into the credit system has evolved. For those born in the 1960s, home loans were the first credit product. For the 1970s and 1980s cohorts, auto loans became the preferred starting point, availed at average ages of 39 and 31, respectively. The average age for a first-time home loan borrower has declined from 41 (for those born in the 1970s) to 28 (for the 1990s-born).","When HDFC began offering home loans in the late 1970s, credit was a privilege.

Goldman Sachs has a ‘buy’ recommendation on Trent with the target price at Rs 6,970. Analysts said the company’s margins came in better than expected by them. They said while the weak gross margin possibly indicated higher than usual discounting during the end-of-the-season sales, operating costs were well below estimates, leading to an operating margin expansion. Some operating costs in the Jan-March quarter were unusually low. Also, the management mentioned that the full year profitability is more representative of the business.Motilal Oswal Financial Services has put a ‘buy’ rating on Varun Beverages with a target price of Rs 665. Analysts believe the company maintained its volume growth trajectory in the domestic market and its expansion in international markets, with the integration in South Africa progressing well. Management is confident about its double-digit growth guidance on the back of industry tailwinds and expansion into new markets every year via the addition of visi-coolers (in domestic and international markets).Elara Securities India has reiterated its ‘accumulate’ call on Ambuja Cements with the target price unchanged at Rs 616. Analysts believe the cement major is well-positioned to deliver healthy volume growth, led by better demand, ramp-up in acquired assets and completion of ongoing capacity expansions.Additionally, while the recent uptick in cement prices will support near-term margin, its continued focus on cost saving initiatives should help keep a check on margin in the medium term. Sub-par demand, weak cement price and a sharp rise in fuel price are key risks to the analysts call.InCred Equities has maintained its ‘add’ recommendation on Aditya Birla Sunlife AMC with the target price at Rs 800 but removed it from its high-conviction stocks list. Analysts believe that the company is taking the right steps for improving market share. However, they see the competition is intensifying, along with volatile capital markets, which seem to be weighing down on equity fund market share movement and SIP inflow. Key downside risks are low traction in new funds and a higher employee attrition rate.Emkay Global Financial Services has a ‘buy’ rating on Adani Green with a target price of Rs 1,500. Analysts said the company reported an uptick in operational capacity and improvement in Capacity Utilization Factor, leading to high growth in sale of power. Book realization was stable on a quarterly basis, while share of merchant cum infirm rose. The management highlighted that the rains impacted Khavda project work in FY25, thus slowing capacity addition to 3.3GW, though FY26 guidance is healthy at 5GW, with 1GW likely to be commissioned within a month.","Goldman Sachs has a ‘buy’ recommendation on Trent with the target price at Rs 6,970.

The Indian company, which posted a revival of sorts over the past few years, with new aggressively designed premium SUVs, was the second-biggest seller in Feb this year.Both Hyundai and Tata Motors, which have a full line-up of cars (hatchbacks, sedans, and SUVs), are under pressure due to the general slowdown in the domestic car industry that is impacting compact cars.

China has said it is open to trade negotiations with the United States but warned that talks cannot proceed unless Washington shows genuine intent by reversing its unilateral tariff measures.According to news agency Associated Press, the statement, issued Friday by China’s commerce ministry, said that Beijing is currently assessing several approaches made by the Trump administration to reinitiate discussions. But it stressed that one-sided tariff hikes—some reaching 145%—will have to go.“China's position is consistent. If we fight, we will fight to the end; if we talk, the door is open. The tariff and trade wars were unilaterally initiated by the US. If the US side wants to talk, it should show its sincerity and be ready to correct wrong practices, including cancelling the unilateral imposition of tariffs,” the ministry said, quoting an unnamed spokesperson.According to the statement, senior US officials have recently conveyed, through intermediaries, a willingness to engage in discussions. China has acknowledged these attempts but cautioned that simply expressing interest is not enough.The US “says one thing but does another,” the spokesperson said, adding that China would not respond to any attempt at coercion or ""blackmail under the guise of talks"".In retaliation to US president Donald Trump’s tariff hikes, China raised import duties on US goods to as high as 125%, restricted exports of key minerals, and halted imports of a range of American agricultural products.","China has said it is open to trade negotiations with the United States.

Fallout at Kohl’s

What’s next for Holt?

Chandra Holt, once considered one of the most promising executives in American retail, is now at the center of a corporate scandal involving her former Walmart colleague, and reported former romantic partner, Ashley Buchanan Buchanan was fired this week as CEO of Kohl’s after the company accused him of engineering a vendor deal riddled with “undisclosed conflicts of interest.”According to a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, Buchanan directed Kohl’s to enter into a multimillion-dollar contract with a vendor that allegedly had “highly suspicious” and “favorable” terms. The filing did not name the vendor or the individual involved, but The Wall Street Journal identified the woman as Chandra Holt.In a statement to The Journal, Holt confirmed she had known Buchanan for a decade but denied any business wrongdoing. “I’ve known Ashley Buchanan for 10 years, but I have not received any compensation for my Incredibrew business from Kohl’s,” she said.Holt is the founder and CEO of Incredibrew, a coffee brand she launched in 2022 that claims to infuse beverages with vitamins and minerals. It remains unclear whether Incredibrew was the vendor involved in the Kohl’s deal under scrutiny.Buchanan and Holt first crossed paths at Walmart, where they worked closely before departing around the same time for other executive roles. Buchanan left in early 2020 to head arts-and-crafts giant Michaels, while Holt exited in 2021 to become CEO of Conn’s HomePlus.Most recently, she served as CEO of Beyond, Inc, the parent company of Overstock.com and Bed Bath & Beyond, between February 2024 and June 2024.Her impressive résumé includes leadership stints at Target, Sam’s Club, and Walgreens. She holds a Bachelor of Arts in advertising, PR, and communications from the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities, and an MBA in strategy and marketing from the Carlson School of Management.Buchanan’s exit comes amid a challenging period for Kohl’s. The company reported a 7.2% drop in annual sales to $15.4 billion and announced plans to close more than two dozen underperforming stores. The firing triggered serious consequences: Buchanan must now forfeit all equity awards granted during his tenure and repay a prorated portion of his $2.5 million signing bonus.While Kohl’s emphasized that the CEO's termination had “no bearing on the company’s financial performance,” the incident adds turbulence to a company already struggling with leadership instability . Buchanan was the third CEO in as many years, following short-lived tenures by Tom Kingsbury and Michelle Gass.Although no formal allegations have been made against Holt, her name is now linked to a boardroom controversy that could complicate her professional path. With her leadership record and entrepreneurial success through Incredibrew, the coming months may determine whether Holt can distance herself from the scandal or whether her past with Buchanan will cast a longer shadow.","Chandra Holt is the founder and CEO of Incredibrew, a coffee brand she launched in 2022 that claims to infuse beverages with vitamins and minerals.

He, however, said that the exact impact of the tariffs remains difficult to predict.Despite trade pressures, Apple posted stronger-than-expected earnings for the first three months of the year, with Cook noting that tariffs had only a limited impact on the company’s fiscal second-quarter results.It reported solid earnings for the first three months of the year, posting a 4.8% increase in profit to $24.78 billion, or $1.65 per share, up from $23.64 billion, or $1.53 per share, a year ago. Revenue rose 5.1% to $95.36 billion from $90.75 billion.Trump’s announcement of a 145% tariff on Chinese-made goods, including iPhones, triggered a rush among US consumers to buy devices ahead of expected price hikes. However, the surge in sales won’t be reflected in Apple’s earnings until the April-June quarter. The renewed trade war has intensified pressure on Cook to replicate the diplomatic maneuvering that previously helped shield the iPhone from tariffs during Trump’s first term.","Apple CEO Tim Cook said most US iPhones would be ""sourced"" in India.

As uncertainty looms over corporate earnings this season, as businesses of all sizes continue to struggle with a volatile global trade environment disrupted by recent changes in US policy.With around half of the S&P 500 companies having reported their latest quarterly results, attention has turned from performance figures to survival strategies, particularly around tariffs and shifting consumer behaviour.General Motors is feeling the heat, trimming its profit outlook in anticipation of rising costs linked to auto tariffs. The car manufacturer, whose production network is spread across North America, now expects full-year adjusted earnings before interest and taxes to fall between $10 billion and $12.5 billion, a sharp reduction from its earlier estimate of $13.7 billion to $15.7 billion. The revised figures reflect a potential tariff exposure of up to $4 or $5 billion.However, the blow may be softened by Donald Trump's executive order signed on Tuesday, relaxing some of the 25% tariffs on cars and car parts.Going a step further, motorcycle giant Harley-Davidson withdrew its financial forecast altogether due to ongoing uncertainty over tariffs and economic headwinds. With nearly 70% of its sales coming from the US, accordinf to FactSet, the company remained exposed to retaliatory tariffs imposed by trading partners.Chocolate maker Hershey is sticking with its full-year forecast, which include assessments for current tariff expenses. The company expected $15 million to $20 million in the second quarter alone. Much like Hershey, other chocolate making companies are also facing difficuly as cocoa supply issues continue to push raw material prices higher. Over 70% of global cocoa comes from West Africa, where weather damage and political instability have disrupted production.Meanwhile, consumer goods company Church & Dwight also sharply downgraded its expectations, citing both tariff costs and weakening consumer demand. The maker of household staples like Arm & Hammer now forecasts flat to 2% earnings growth this year, down from earlier projections of up to 8%.Its projected tariff hit is estimated at $190 million over the next year. However, to cushion the impact, the company is planning to stop sourcing Waterpik flossers from China, and is considering shutting or selling off some brands. It is also expecting to sell off or shut down some of its brands.","General Motors is feeling the heat, trimming its profit outlook in anticipation of rising costs linked to auto tariffs.

Revenue was also ahead of expectations, rising 13% year-on-year and outpacing analysts’ predictions of $68.44 billion.CEO Satya Nadella credited the company’s continued focus on cloud and AI as the driving force behind the results. “Cloud and AI are the essential inputs for every business to expand output, reduce costs, and accelerate growth,” he said in a statement.Microsoft’s cloud division brought in $26.8 billion, marking a 21% increase compared to last year and beating estimates of $26.17 billion. The company’s personal computing unit, which includes its Windows operating system, Surface laptops, and Xbox gaming services, also saw a 6% boost, generating $13.4 billion in revenue.Despite broader turmoil in the tech sector and economic volatility under President Donald Trump’s second term, marked by new tariffs and stock market instability, Microsoft's earnings provided a welcome lift for investors.The company’s share price, which had dipped nearly 8% since January to almost $395, rebounded more than 6% in after-hours trading following the release of its results.Speaking to investors, Nadella said demand for cloud and AI services remains strong. “We just want to make sure we are accounting for the latest and greatest information,” he added, pointing to Microsoft’s ongoing efforts to adjust its investments based on new computing efficiencies and evolving customer needs.As tariff-related uncertainty continues to loom over parts of the business, Microsoft’s performance has offered a rare moment of optimism for the tech sector in a turbulent economic climate.","Microsoft reported $70.1 billion in revenue and an 18% surge in profits for the January–March period.

"Average rate on a US 30-year mortgage eases to 6.76%, its second straight weekly decline",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/average-rate-on-a-us-30-year-mortgage-eases-to-6-76-its-second-straight-weekly-decline/articleshow/120799909.cms,"Representative image

The average rate on a 30-year mortgage in the U.S. eased again this week, modest relief for prospective home shoppers during what's traditionally the busiest time of the year for the housing market.The rate fell to 6.76% from 6.81% last week, mortgage buyer Freddie Mac said Thursday. A year ago, the rate averaged 7.22%.Borrowing costs on 15-year fixed-rate mortgages, popular with homeowners refinancing their home loans, also fell. The average rate dropped to 5.92% from 5.94% last week. It's down from 6.47% a year ago, Freddie Mac said.Mortgage rates are influenced by several factors, including global demand for U.S. Treasurys, the Federal Reserve's interest rate policy decisions and bond market investors' expectations for future inflation.After climbing to a just above 7% in mid-January, the average rate on a 30-year mortgage has remained above 6.62%, where it was just three weeks ago. It then spiked above 6.8% the next two weeks, reflecting volatility in the 10-year Treasury yield, which lenders use as a guide to pricing home loans.The yield, which had mostly fallen after climbing to around 4.8% in mid-January, surged last month to 4.5% amid a sell-off in government bonds triggered by investor anxiety over the Trump administration's trade war.The 10-year Treasury yield was at 4.23% in midday trading Thursday, up from 4.17% late Wednesday.As mortgage rates decline , they help give homebuyers more purchasing power. While down from a year ago, mortgage rates haven't come down enough to encourage more home shoppers at a time when real estate prices are still rising nationally, albeit more slowly, and the number of properties on the market has risen sharply from a year ago.It's one reason the spring homebuying season is off to a lackluster start. Sales of previously occupied U.S. homes fell in March, posting the largest monthly drop since November 2022.An index that tracks home loan applications fell 4.2% last week from a week earlier, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. That was the index's second straight weekly drop, although it was up 16.5% from a year earlier.""Mortgage applications fell for the second consecutive week as uncertainty continues to impact many buyers' decisions to enter the housing market,"" said MBA CEO Bob Broeksmit.Economists expect mortgage rates to remain volatile in coming months, though they generally call for the average rate on a 30-year mortgage to remain above 6.5% this year.""Homebuyers would like to see rates come down further, but it is becoming more likely that they will remain in the high 6% range this spring,"" said Lisa Sturtevant, chief economist at Bright MLS.","The average rate on a 30-year mortgage fell to 6.76% from 6.81% last week.

Kohl's fires CEO Ashley Buchanan over undisclosed conflict of interest,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/kohls-fires-ceo-ashley-buchanan-over-undisclosed-conflict-of-interest/articleshow/120799508.cms,"Kohl's CEO fired

American retail chain Kohl’s has terminated CEO Ashley Buchanan following an investigation that uncovered undisclosed conflicts of interest in vendor transactions Effective immediately, chairman Michael Bender has been appointed interim CEO. As part of the transition, Bender will step down from the board's audit, compensation, and nominating and ESG committees, according to a regulatory filing cited by the Associated Press.Buchanan’s dismissal comes less than four months after he assumed the role on January 15, having previously led Michaels arts and crafts chain. He was Kohl’s third CEO in as many years, taking the helm at a time when the company faced declining sales and mounting competition.Kohl’s clarified that Buchanan’s termination is unrelated to the company's financial performance, reporting, or the conduct of other employees.According to an SEC filing , the decision followed an external investigation led by the board’s audit committee. The probe found Buchanan had arranged business transactions with a vendor established by a personal associate, granting the firm unusually favorable terms, including a substantial consulting agreement. Crucially, he failed to disclose these relationships as required by the company’s code of ethics.As a result, Buchanan will forfeit all equity awards, including those granted as part of his recruitment package in January.He is also required to repay £2.5 million as a prorated portion of his signing bonus. His nomination to the board has been withdrawn ahead of the company’s annual shareholders’ meeting on May 14.Buchanan had succeeded Tom Kingsbury, who stepped in as interim CEO in December 2022 and was later made permanent CEO in February 2023. Kingsbury remains with the company as an advisor and board member until his upcoming retirement.Kohl’s, which operates around 1,600 stores across the US, continues to face headwinds, including a drop in discretionary spending by its core middle-income customers due to inflationary pressures. The company also contends with stiff competition from Walmart and Amazon, particularly in affordable fashion, and broader uncertainty tied to President Donald Trump 's sweeping tariff policies.Despite these challenges, Kohl’s preliminary first-quarter results released Thursday slightly beat expectations. The company expects a comparable sales decline of 4.3 to 4 per cent and a net loss of 20 to 24 cents per share—better than analyst estimates of a 6.4 per cent sales drop and 54-cent loss, according to FactSet.Final quarterly results will be announced on May 29. Shares of the Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin-based retailer rose nearly 9 per cent in late morning trading.","Ashley Buchanan was fired following an investigation that uncovered undisclosed conflicts of interest in vendor transactions.

US manufacturing weakens further in April amid tariff turmoil,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-manufacturing-weakens-further-in-april-amid-tariff-turmoil/articleshow/120798792.cms,"AI-generated image

The US manufacturing sector contracted for another month in April, as mounting uncertainty surrounding President Donald Trump's tariff policies continued to weigh heavily on industrial activity, according to new survey data released Thursday.In early April, the administration introduced sweeping tariffs affecting most nations. Although some of the duties were revised for selected countries, a punitive 145 per cent tariff on Chinese imports remained intact, with sector-specific measures still under consideration. The resulting policy volatility has triggered market instability and heightened uncertainty across the industry.The Institute for Supply Management's (ISM) manufacturing index slipped to 48.7 per cent in April, down slightly from March and below the 50-point threshold that separates expansion from contraction. Although the reading was marginally better than economists had forecast, it still underscored a deepening slowdown.Also read: Apple exports 97.6% of iPhones to US from India to preempt higher tariffs on imports from China ""Demand and production retreated, and destaffing continued as companies responded to an uncertain economic environment,"" said Timothy Fiore, Chair of the ISM Manufacturing Business Survey Committee. He added that rising input prices—driven in part by tariffs—contributed to new order backlogs, slower supplier deliveries, and rising inventories.Multiple survey respondents cited tariff policy as a key concern. “Tariff trade wars are incredibly volatile, quickly changing, and disrupting a ton of our current work,” said a representative from the apparel and leather industry.Another manufacturer noted the direct financial toll of the 145 per cent tariff on Chinese imports: “The recently imposed tariff rate is significantly affecting our 2025 profitability. Given the complexity of our parts and the lack of alternative sources, it’s nearly impossible to find cost-effective replacements for our Chinese suppliers.”Matthew Martin, Senior US Economist at Oxford Economics, said that while the headline number slightly exceeded expectations, the broader implications were troubling.“Respondents’ comments were rife with tariff troubles—citing weaker demand, higher costs, and deepening supply chain disruptions,” he said in a note. “Worryingly, companies are now moving from hiring freezes and natural attrition toward layoffs as they seek to control costs.”The April ISM report paints a cautious picture of the road ahead for American manufacturing, with trade tensions, cost pressures, and supply chain bottlenecks continuing to erode confidence in the sector.","The Institute for Supply Management's (ISM) manufacturing index slipped to 48.7 per cent in April.

Key elements of the deal:

At present the deal has 55 minerals, but more can be agreed to in the future. Some of the critical minerals in the deal are titanium, lithium and uranium.



The US and Ukraine are setting up a new reconstruction investment fund together and will have equal say in its management. It will help the US continue its support, including military aid like air defence systems, and also aims to bring in investments from European allies.



Ukraine retains full ownership and control over its natural resources, including rare earth elements, oil and gas and the deal only applies to new discoveries and ventures, not to existing state-run operations.



Importantly, Ukraine won’t owe any debt to the US through this fund. All profits will be put back into rebuilding Ukraine’s infrastructure, energy, and mining sectors, and no money can be taken out for the first ten years.



The United States, through its international development finance corporation, will contribute funds and technology to the scheme, while Ukraine is to allocate 50% of future profits from new government-owned resource projects into the fund.



Ukraine’s mineral industry

After months of tense back-and-forth, the United States and Ukraine have finally signed a new agreement that will give Washington access to critical minerals and other untapped natural resources in Ukraine. Kyiv believes that the move will help lock in long-term military and financial support as it continues to resist Russian aggression.The deal, signed on Wednesday, still needs to be ratified by Ukraine’s parliament, but is already seen as much beneficial to the country as compared to earlier proposals that the officials had criticised as one-sided. In the previous drafts, they said, Ukraine was treated as a junior partner and would have handed the US overly broad rights to exploit its natural assets. The deal would also establish a reconstruction fund for Ukraine.“This is an agreement in which the United States notes its commitment to promoting long-term peace in Ukraine and recognizes the contribution that Ukraine has made to global security by giving up its nuclear arsenal,” Ukrainian economy minister Yulia Svyrydenko said in a Facebook post.“We have formed a version of the agreement that provides mutually beneficial conditions for both countries.”A group of 17 elements that are crucial for many kinds of consumer technology, including cellphones, hard drives and electric and hybrid vehicles. These elements include lanthanum, cerium and scandium, which are also included in the deal. At present, China is the largest producer of rare earth elements. Ukraine holds deposits of 22 out of the 34 minerals classified as critical by the European Union, according to Ukrainian data cited by Reuters. These include a mix of industrial and construction materials, ferroalloys, precious and non-ferrous metals, as well as select rare earth elements. According to the state geological service, Ukraine holds one of the largest confirmed lithium reserves in Europe, estimated at 500,000 metric tons. Lithium is essential for producing batteries, ceramics, and glass.Ukraine's rare earth industry remains largely undeveloped due to restrictive state policies, limited geological data, and the ongoing war. Mineral reserves are scattered and poorly studied, making the industry's potential uncertain. Still, Ukraine holds some of Europe’s largest reserves of titanium and lithium. In 2021, the mineral sector contributed 6.1% to GDP and 30% of exports. However, 40% of metallic resources lie in Russian-occupied areas, prompting calls to exploit remaining reserves swiftly.Earlier, Trump administration officials had floated a deal that would have seen Washington collect $500 billion in mineral profits as repayment for its wartime support. However, it was rejected by the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, reportedly telling US negotiators he would not sign off on a deal “that will be paid off by 10 generations of Ukrainians.”US secretary of state Marco Rubio called the agreement “a very critical step” in what he described as a pivotal week for American-led diplomatic efforts in the region.The deal highlights a growing effort by Washington to reduce reliance on China for rare earth elements.","The US and Ukraine are setting up a new reconstruction investment fund together.

However, it also added that in case the US wishes to initiate contact, “there is no harm at this stage for China to engage.""The post, quoted by Reuters further said that China should closely observe the situation and, if necessary, force out the true intentions behind efforts to maintain control over both negotiation and confrontation.Beijing has long been criticising the duties, describing them as economic bullying and a deliberate attempt to suppress China’s growth. Earlier, China’s foreign ministry had also accused the United States of deliberately trying to isolate it by pressuring other countries to curb trade ties with Beijing, describing the tactic as a “90-day pause game.”So far, it has responded more with defiance than diplomacy, rallying domestic and international opposition to the measures.However, behind the scenes, China also began quietly exempting certain US goods, such as pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, and jet engines, from its own retaliatory 125% tariffs, according to news agency Reuters. The move was aimed towards safeguarding its domestic firms from the tariff blow while maintaining a firm public stance.Trump’s tariffs became a major hurdle for Chinese exporters once they surpassed 35%, with analysts at Nomura Securities warning of serious long-term fallout. They also estimated that a 50% cut in exports to the US could put as many as 16 million Chinese jobs at risk.Despite its tough public stance, China’s recent moves, such as exempting select US goods from its tariffs and the Yuyuan Tantian post suggesting tariff discussions hint at a more cautious, measured approach.Chinese officials, meanwhile, remain publicly defiant. A foreign ministry spokesperson, Guo Jiakun, told reporters on Wednesday, “as far as I know, there have been no consultations or negotiations between China and the US on tariffs.”Trump suggested a deal may be on the horizon believing that there was a “very good chance” his administration could strike a deal with China. Speaking to US media previously, he said that talks were underway, claiming that Chinese President Xi Jinping had called him. The claim was flatly denied by Beijing and accused Washington of “misleading the public”.Nonetheless, China has maintained that it is open to dialogue, on the condition that any negotiations are based on “equality, respect and mutual benefit.” Whether Washington’s outreach meets that bar remains to be seen.","The US has tried reaching out to China, seeking discussions over President Donald Trump’s massive 145% tariff, a social media account linked to Chinese state media has claimed. The post, citing anonymous sources, hinted at a notable development after weeks of vocal condemnation by China, in an ongoing bitter trade standoff.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120792790,imgsize-196805,width-400,resizemode-4/120792790.jpg"

‘That’s Biden’: Donald Trump deflects blame as US economy contracts,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/thats-biden-donald-trump-deflects-blame-as-us-economy-contracts/articleshow/120786534.cms,"‘That’s Biden’: Donald Trump deflects blame as US economy contracts (Picture credit: PTI)

US President Donald Trump on Wednesday downplayed concerns over the first quarterly US economic contraction in three years, casting blame on his predecessor and insisting the country was on the verge of a rebound. “You probably saw some numbers today, and I have to start off by saying that’s Biden,” Trump told reporters, referring to the GDP figures without further explanation.According to the news agency Reuters, the US commerce department announced that gross domestic product (GDP) fell in the first quarter, driven by a surge in imports ahead of Trump's sweeping tariffs.The decline marked a symbolic blow just as Trump completed 100 days in office. Though some economists highlighted strong consumer spending and business investment as signs of a potential recovery, fears of recession have grown.Despite the headwinds, Trump maintained an optimistic outlook, promising, “When the boom begins, it will be like no other. Be patient!!!”Trump’s aides struggled to present a unified explanation, with conflicting statements about whether the downturn reflected positive underlying trends or external distortions.“We had numbers that, despite what we were handed, we turned them around,” Trump said during a televised Cabinet meeting.He attributed the contraction to “distortions” in government spending, inventory accumulation, and imports.Trump adviser Peter Navarro praised the GDP data despite its negative value, calling it “the best negative print... I've ever seen in my life.” He argued the dip was due to businesses rushing to import goods before tariffs took effect.Trump’s approval rating has declined since his inauguration, with a recent Reuters/Ipsos poll showing only 42% approval overall, and just 36% support for his handling of the economy, the lowest in his current or previous term.The US GDP contracted at an annual rate of 0.3% in Q1 2025, falling short of market expectations of 0.4% growth. The commerce department attributed the decline to increased imports, slowing consumer spending, and a drop in government expenditure.Democrats seized on the downturn. “This is not Joe Biden’s economy, Donald, it is your economy,” said US house minority leader Hakeem Jeffries, calling it “a failed economy”.Markets reacted sharply, with major Wall Street indices falling amid fears of a prolonged downturn. The volatility was fuelled by Trump’s tariff strategy, which some economists say could stall trade flows entirely, especially with China.Economist Joseph Brusuelas was quoted by Reuters saying that, “This is all policy induced… unless the tariffs are walked back rapidly, it’s just simply going to be too late to avoid an economic downturn.”","US GDP contracted at an annual rate of 0.3% in Q1 2025, falling short of market expectations.

NEW DELHI: More than 1.14 lakh startups in India have created over 12 lakh jobs so far, the finance ministry said in its latest review of the Indian economy .In the report titled, ‘The Indian Economy: A Review January 2024’, the Department of Economic Affairs said that the 1.14 lakh startups recognised by the government under the 'Startup India initiative’ created more than 12 lakh jobs (as of October 2023).The state-owned e-commerce platform Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) clocked more than 63 lakh transactions till November 2023, the document read.Despite facing global challenges in 2023 like valuation issues, few IPOs, regulatory changes and macroeconomic and geopolitical trends, India remains the third largest tech start-up ecosystem globally, with over 950 tech startups founded last year.The cumulative funding for more than 31,000 tech start ups has exceeded $70 billion (from 2019 to 2023), according to a recent report by Nasscom in collaboration with Zinnov.“In 2023, despite facing global economic and regulatory challenges, Indian tech startups have prioritised the imperative of enhancing their business fundamentals, driving profitability and growth,” said Debjani Ghosh, President, Nasscom.“The proliferation of tech startups in tier 2 and 3 cities marks the ecosystem's resilience,” she added.Navigating 2024, tech startup founders expect to continue the revenue growth path with measured steps focusing on optimising expenditure and maximising profitability for B2B tech startups.Investments in deeptech will continue an upward trend in 2024.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor ( CEA ) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.Udaan built an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business still accounts for a very small part of India’s overall retail market but can balloon to $150 billion in sales and yield a 100% return on capital invested in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co. estimates published in the Mint newspaper.Bengaluru-based Udaan has also ventured into financing through its fintech unit which helps shopkeepers get working capital loans to buy inventory. That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says. Udaan competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods. The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-105001128,imgsize-151312,width-400,resizemode-4/105001128.jpg"

Space sector start-up Sisir Radar to develop SAR on L/P band SAR,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/space-sector-start-up-sisir-radar-to-develop-sar-on-l/p-band-sar/articleshow/104558111.cms,"CHENNAI: Space sector startup, Sisir Radar Private Ltd has hit success at the prestigious iDEX DefSpace Challenge with its projects for development of “L/P band Continuous Wave SAR (synthetic aperture radar) payload for LEO Small Satellites” and “Unfurlable, Electronically Steering Antenna for L/P band SAR payload” for Indian Air Force (IAF), said a top company official.The company is promoted by former Director at the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) Tapan Misra and the brains behind the Indian space agency’s RISAT series of SAR satellites as well as the Dual Frequency SAR on the Chandrayaan 2 orbiter that is currently circling the moon.""A grant of Rs 3 crore is also there for development of the products,"" Misra told IANS.Synthetic Aperture Radar or SAR is a special kind of imaging radar technology that can provide extremely accurate high resolution imagery of the terrain through clouds, smoke and dust even in pitch dark conditions. SAR imagery provides much higher resolution than other forms of remote sensing technology such as hyperspectral and multispectral. SAR is a critical technology for strategic reconnaissance and planning as well as for disaster management.According to Misra, winning the challenge in just over a year of floating the company is a major booster.He said L and P band SAR have an advantage over other frequencies (like X band) when it comes to penetration capabilities through rain, clouds, foliage and vegetation in a tropical country like India, and underground penetration capabilities in dry terrain.Continuing further, he said the L band SAR will provide 1 metre resolution, spotlight resolution in Stripmap mode. The current industry standard is 5-10 metre in L band. Misra said both the L and P band will operate simultaneously from a satellite borne SAR. Recently, Sisir Radar successfully developed and tested the world’s highest resolution L-Band SAR fitted on a drone. With 0.2 metre resolution, this is by far the highest L band SAR in the world, he said.","Space sector startup, Sisir Radar Private Ltd has hit success at the prestigious iDEX DefSpace Challenge.

Testify: Sam Bankman-Fried acknowledges 'mistakes' but testifies he did not defraud anyone,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/cryptocurrency/sam-bankman-fried-acknowledges-mistakes-but-testifies-he-did-not-defraud-anyone/articleshow/104761929.cms,"<p>Sam Bankman-Fried (File Photo- Reuters)<br></p>

NEW YORK: Sam Bankman-Fried , testifying in his own defense at his fraud trial on Friday, acknowledged that a ""lot of people got hurt"" when the FTX cryptocurrency exchange he founded collapsed, but said he did not defraud anyone or take customer funds.Shortly after taking the witness stand in Manhattan federal court, Bankman-Fried said he made ""a number of small mistakes and a number of larger mistakes"" while running the now-bankrupt exchange. The biggest mistake, he said, was not implementing a dedicated risk management team.""We thought that we might be able to build the best product on the market,"" Bankman-Fried said. ""It turned out basically the opposite of that. A lot of people got hurt - customers, employees - and the company ended up in bankruptcy.""Prosecutors accuse Bankman-Fried of using FTX customer funds to prop up his crypto-focused hedge fund, Alameda Research, make speculative venture investments and donate more than $100 million to US political campaigns. He also faces charges of scheming to cheat Alameda's lenders and FTX investors.He has pleaded not guiltyBankman-Fried's trial, which began on October 3, is drawing to a close nearly a year after FTX collapsed amid a wave of customer withdrawals. The company declared bankruptcy in November 2022 and Bankman-Fried was indicted the following month.His testimony marked the first time the dozen jurors and five alternates have heard directly from the 31-year-old former billionaire after 12 trial days.Bankman-Fried, who was jailed in August after US District Judge Lewis Kaplan found he likely tampered with witnesses, wore a suit and spoke with two water bottles placed in front of him on the witness stand. The former mogul once known for wearing shorts and T-shirts and sporting an unkempt mop of curly locks cut his hair before his trial began.Responding to questions posed by his defense lawyer Mark Cohen, Bankman-Fried spoke in calm, measured tones during the first portion of his testimony as he recounted founding Alameda in 2017, shortly after graduating from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, despite knowing little about crypto.But Bankman-Fried - who had studied physics and worked as a quantitative trader at Jane Street - said he saw opportunities for ""arbitrage"" in the market for digital assets. He said Alameda's first office was in a small Airbnb in Berkeley, California, before he later moved the firm to Hong Kong.""We wanted to be under the radar at that point in time,"" he said on the stand, adding he named the hedge fund after the California county where it was founded in part so competitors would not discover what they were doing.Jurors have heard from three of his closest confidantes at FTX and Alameda, all of whom have pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors. They testified earlier this month that they committed financial crimes at Bankman-Fried's behest.For criminal defendants, taking the stand is a risky proposition because it opens them up to potentially probing cross-examination by prosecutors.But given Bankman-Fried's penchant for risk, legal experts say he likely viewed taking the stand as his best shot to counter the allegations made by members of his inner circle, which were backed up by spreadsheets the three said demonstrated how customer funds were stolen and text messages in which they discussed FTX's shortfall of funds with Bankman-Fried.","Sam Bankman-Fried says he made ""a number of small mistakes and a number of larger mistakes"" while running the now-bankrupt exchange.

"Crypto isn’t dead, it’s evolving rapidly to create a new world",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/cryptocurrency/crypto-isnt-dead-its-evolving-rapidly-to-create-a-new-world/articleshow/101324954.cms,"Regulatory landscape



There are few technologies as confusing to most people as crypto and blockchain. The tech and regulations underpinning it are evolving so rapidly, it is difficult for even technologists to often make sense of it.Crypto assets and crypto currencies are based on blockchain tech, which is a form of distributed ledger technology that stores data on thousands of data servers around the world, as opposed to today where data is stored only in one place or clustered in a few locations. This data is open, meaning it can be viewed and verified by anyone taking part in that particular system. What this means practically is that an individual can transfer crypto assets without the help of intermediaries, say, banks or government agencies, thereby ensuring privacy, speed and lower costs.The first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin , was created with anonymity in mind, it was a way for people to conduct financial transactions away from the prying eyes of governments. While it went on to become a speculative asset, today, crypto, and the underlying blockchain technology, has a far more ambitious goal – the transformation of the internet.CoinDCX CTO Vivek Gupta says this technology can help usher in Web 3. 0 – a decentralised form of the internet where users can actually monetise their time spent online. “Whatever Web3 use case you may be driving, the value that comes from it must be distributed, and you cannot distribute that without crypto. For something as simple as depositing money in a pool and getting a receipt token, that receipt token is a crypto. That’s the proof that I have deposited the money. Without crypto there is no Web3 use case,” he says.Decentralised finance (DeFi) is a huge part of what makes blockchain tech so disruptive. Imagine being able to lend your money to strangers on the internet and get paid an interest. Or imagine spending time on socialmedia platforms or playing video games and getting paid for your time spent by someone who needs data about you. Web3 makes this possible because the data isn’t controlled by any one company or country.Decentralised apps (dApps) are another Web3 feature. Unlike traditional apps hosted on centralised servers, dApps operate on a peer-to-peer network and utilisethe consensus mechanism and transparency features of blockchain technology.“I see a big disruption coming, especially in the DeFi tokenisation space and the whole content creator economy,” says Ravi Chamria, co-founder & CEO of Zeeve, a blockchain automation platform.Ashish Singhal, co-founder & CEO of CoinSwitch, says the tech can revolutionise how we conduct business, store data, and even vote, since the tech allows people to verify data of any kind efficiently.Governments are worried about what crypto could mean for monetary policy, for their ability to regulate people’s lives. But disruption hardly ever requires consensus. If a new technology proves to be better than an old one, people will drift towards it.Central banks have recognised the importance of the technology and some are creating Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) that are based on blockchain technology. “There’s a lot of activity happening in the regulated DeFi space. Looking at the future, we think guardrails are probably a good thing to have around these sorts of technologies,” says Andrew Vranjes, VP of sales at Blockdaemon, a blockchain infrastructure platform.Cryptocurrencies too are rapidly changing. Where before the value of cryptocurrencies were based on what people were willing to pay for them, today there are crypto assets that are backed by real world assets like equity and real estate. Silvina Moschini’s Unicoin is one of them. “It is an assets backed, audited, SEC-compliant cryptocurrency,” she says.","Crypto assets and crypto currencies are based on blockchain tech, which is a form of distributed ledger technology that stores data on thousands of data servers around the world.

"US tightens crackdown on crypto with lawsuits against Coinbase, Binance",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/cryptocurrency/bitcoin/us-tightens-crackdown-on-crypto-with-lawsuits-against-coinbase-binance/articleshow/100810119.cms,"BROKER, EXCHANGE CRACKDOWN



NEW YORK: The top U.S. securities regulator sued cryptocurrency platform Coinbase on Tuesday, the second lawsuit in two days against a major crypto exchange, in a dramatic escalation of a crackdown on the industry and one that could dramatically transform a market that has largely operated outside regulation.The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Monday took aim at Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange. The SEC accuses Binance and its CEO Changpeng Zhao of operating a ""web of deception"".If successful, the lawsuits could transform the crypto market by successfully asserting the SEC's jurisdiction over the industry which for years has argued that tokens do not constitute securities and should not be regulated by the SEC.""The two cases are different, but overlap and point in the same direction: the SEC's increasingly aggressive campaign to bring cryptocurrencies under the jurisdiction of the federal securities laws,"" said Kevin O'Brien, a partner at Ford O'Brien Landy and a former federal prosecutor, adding, however, that the SEC has not previously taken on such major crypto players.""If the SEC prevails in either case, the cryptocurrency industry will be transformed.""In its complaint filed in Manhattan federal court, the SEC said Coinbase has since at least 2019 made billions of dollars by operating as a middleman on crypto transactions, while evading disclosure requirements meant to protect investors.The SEC said Coinbase traded at least 13 crypto assets that are securities that should have been registered, including tokens such as Solana, Cardano and Polygon.Coinbase suffered about $1.28 billion of net customer outflows following the lawsuit, according to initial estimates from data firm Nansen. Shares of Coinbase's parent Coinbase Global Inc closed down $7.10, or 12.1%, at $51.61 after earlier falling as much as 20.9%. They are up 46% this year.Paul Grewal, Coinbase's general counsel, in a statement said the company will continue operating as usual and has ""demonstrated commitment to compliance.""Oanda senior market analyst Ed Moya said the SEC ""looks like it's playing Whac-A-Mole with crypto exchanges,"" and because most exchanges offer a range of tokens that operate on blockchain protocols targeted by regulators, ""it seems like this is just the beginning.""Leading cryptocurrency bitcoin has been a paradoxical beneficiary of the crackdown.After an initial plunge to a nearly three-month low of $25,350 following the Binance suit, bitcoin rebounded by more than $2,000, exceeding the previous day's high. It was trading just below $27,000 at 0410 GMT.""The SEC is making life nearly impossible for several altcoins and that is actually driving some crypto traders back into bitcoin,"" explained Oanda's Moya.Securities, as opposed to other assets such as commodities, are strictly regulated and require detailed disclosures to inform investors of potential risks. The Securities Act of 1933 outlined a definition of the term ""security,"" yet many experts rely on two U.S. Supreme Court cases to determine if an investment product constitutes a security.SEC Chair Gary Gensler has long said tokens constitute securities and has steadily asserted its authority over the crypto market, focusing initially on the sale of tokens and interest-bearing crypto products. More recently, it has taken aim at unregistered crypto broker dealer, exchange trading and clearing activity.While a few crypto companies are licensed as alternative system trading systems, a type of trading platform used by brokers to trade listed securities, no crypto platform operates as a full-blown stock exchange. The SEC also this year sued Beaxy Digital and Bittrex Global for failing to register as an exchange, clearing house and broker.""The whole business model is built on a noncompliance with the U.S. securities laws and we're asking them to come into compliance,"" Gensler told CNBC.Crypto companies refute that tokens meet the definition of a security, say the SEC's rules are ambiguous, and that the SEC is overstepping its authority in trying to regulate them. Still, many companies have boosted compliance, shelved products and expanded outside the country in response to the crackdown.Kristin Smith, CEO of the Blockchain Association trade group, rejected Gensler's efforts to oversee the industry.""We're confident the courts will prove Chair Gensler wrong in due time,"" she said.Founded in 2012, Coinbase recently served more than 108 million customers and ended March with $130 billion of customer crypto assets and funds on its balance sheet. Transactions generated 75% of its $3.15 billion of net revenue last year.Tuesday's SEC lawsuit seeks civil fines, the recouping of ill-gotten gains and injunctive relief.On Monday, the SEC accused Binance of inflating trading volumes, diverting customer funds, improperly commingling assets, failing to restrict U.S. customers from its platform, and misleading customers about its controls.Binance pledged to vigorously defend itself against the lawsuit, which it said reflected the SEC's ""misguided and conscious refusal"" to provide clarity to the crypto industry.Customers pulled around $790 million from Binance and its U.S. affiliate following the lawsuit, Nansen said.On Tuesday, the SEC filed a motion to freeze assets belonging to Binance.US, Binance's U.S. affiliate. The holding company of Binance is based in the Cayman Islands.""It's important to note that recent regulatory actions are aimed at ensuring that companies operating in the cryptocurrency industry are complying with securities laws and protecting investors - this will always be their goal,"" said Joshua Chu, group chief risk officer at blockchain technology firms XBE, Coinllectibles and Marvion.""These events will ultimately lead to a more stable and trustworthy industry, which could help to attract more institutional investors and mainstream adoption.""","The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Monday took aim at Binance. The SEC accuses Binance and its CEO Changpeng Zhao of operating a ""web of deception"" If successful, the lawsuits could transform the crypto market by successfully asserting the SEC's jurisdiction over the industry.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-100810085,imgsize-36192,width-400,resizemode-4/100810085.jpg"

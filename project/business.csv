Gold price prediction today: Gold rates have been fluctuating in the last few weeks and no clear upside or downside is obvious. Global events, such as Donald Trump’s tariff moves and geopolitical conflicts are shaping the movement of gold prices on a daily basis. In such uncertain scenarios, what should investors do? What’s the outlook on gold prices in the near term?Spot gold rallied sharply in the week ending May 23 on soaring safe haven demand due to the rating agency Moody's downgrading the US credit rating on May 17 and heightened economic uncertainty due to the US President imposing a 50% tariff on European goods from June 1. The US President Trump has delayed the 50% EU tariffs to July 9.Last week, US treasuries cratered, and the US Dollar Index slumped on worries over the state of the US economy. Spot gold recorded a huge weekly gain of 4.84% as it closed at $3357; it was up by 1.89% on Friday.Yesterday, the US markets were closed to observe Memorial Day Holiday, while the London market is observing Spring Bank Holiday.On May 23, President Trump said that he would be imposing a 50% tariff on European goods starting June 1 as he felt that US-Europe talks on trade deals were not going anywhere.Trump's tariff threats were not limited to Europe only. In fact, he also threatened Samsung and Apple with a 25% tariff if their products are not made in the US. Later, on May 25, Trump walked back on tariff threats to Europe as he extended the deadline to July 9 citing positive talks with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen who said that Europe is ready to advance talks swiftly and decisively.Deepening concerns over the US economic outlook amid tariff uncertainty have weighed heavily on the US bonds and the Dollar Index. Both ten-year and thirty-year US yields surged past the post-reciprocal tariff levels last week. On May 22, ten-year US yields soared to 4.62%, highest since February 2025 before backing off on Trump calling for a 50% tariff rate for Europe. Similarly, 30-year yields surged to 5.15%, highest since October 2023. Ten-year and thirty-year yields closed at the highest weekly levels since January 1 and October 27 respectively.The US Dollar Index fell nearly 2% last week to end at 99.11, the lowest daily close since April 28, and is currently at 99.03 is down by around 0.07%. The Index is threatening to breach the post reciprocal low of 97.92 reached on April 21.Total known global gold ETF holdings stood at 87.86 MOz as of May 23, down nearly 2% from the peak level of 89.77 MOz seen on April 21; holdings fell for the fifth straight week to the lowest level since April 8. Nonetheless, holdings are still up over 6% YTD.Hedge Fund managers have increased their bullish gold bets by 7,741 bet-long positions to 118,615, the most bullish position in four-weeks, as the short-only total fell to the lowest in eight weeks.Major US data and reports to be released this week include Conference Board Consumer Confidence (May), FOMC minutes (May 7 meeting), GDP (1Q secondary estimate), real personal spending (April), PCE price Index (April) - the Fed's preferred gauge of inflation and University of Michigan Sentiment (May Final) and short-term and long-term inflation expectations.Gold may fall further on easing trade tensions following President Trump delaying the European tariff to July 9. On Monday, the metal had swung between $3324 and $3358, relatively a narrower range, as New York and London markets were on holiday.Near-term support is seen at $3311/$3292 followed by $3275 and $3250. This week, if no further developments on tariff fronts, is likely to be marked with data driven volatility, as the US economic calendar is quite busy. Easing trade tensions may push the prices further down.Traders may sell with stoploss above $3365-$3371 resistance zone. However, downside may be somewhat limited -- may be up to $3292/$3275 or so, on concerns due to erratic trade policies of the US. A correction in gold prices will then give an opportunity to go long on the yellow metal with stoploss below $3250.On the upside, a breach of $3365-$3371 resistance zone will open the way for $3435. Above $3435, the all-time high of $3500 will come into the focus.","Gold may fall further on easing trade tensions following President Trump delaying the European tariff to July 9.

India's Astounding Growth in Numbers: Top 5 Points

In 2025, India will become the 4th largest economy in the world, in nominal GDP terms, overtaking Japan, and will be behind only the US, China, and Germany.

India’s nominal GDP has more than doubled from 2014 to 2025 (projected). It’s a growth of 105% in just a decade. In 2025, India will also become a $4 trillion economy

India was the 10th largest world economy in 2014 - come 2025 it will be the 4th largest - a six places jump in rankings in just 11 years!

In a world of increasing global economic uncertainties, and amidst geopolitical conflicts and Donald Trump’s tariffs, India will still retain the tag of being the fastest growing major world economy with a GDP growth rate of 6.2% for 2025.

India achieved an average annual growth rate of 6.7% from 1990–2023 & in fact outpaced the US (3.8%), Germany (3.9%), and Japan (2.8%).

What’s worked for India?

The sobering picture

In fact, India doesn’t even rank in top 100 countries when it comes to GDP per capita, not even in the Purchasing Power Parity or PPP rankings.

Road Ahead: More reforms, reforms, reforms

India will become the world’s fourth largest economy by the end of 2025 (FY 2025-26), according to the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ’s) World Economic Outlook report for April 2025. The IMF measures the size of an economy in nominal GDP terms. A few years ago, India overtook the United Kingdom to become the fifth largest, and is now well on its way to rise to the fourth spot in the list of the top 10 largest economies in the world by overtaking Japan.Recently a statement by NITI Aayog CEO BVR Subrahmanyam suggested that India has already become the world's fourth largest economy, however yesterday NITI Aayog member Arvind Virmani clarified that Subrahmanyam was referring to IMF's latest projections and that India is slated to become the 4th largest by the end of this year.To become the world’s fourth largest economy is no mean feat - India has gone from being the 10th largest in 2014 to 4th largest in 11 years under the Modi government. Its Gross Domestic Product or GDP has more than doubled in this time frame. How has the Indian economy achieved this remarkable growth? Why does the per capita GDP number present a sombre picture? And what’s the road ahead for India to become a $5 trillion economy, and the world’s third largest?Also Read | Explained: Why India is well positioned to deal with negative effects of Trump’s tariffs & top reasons it will be at an advantage India has been on the reform path in the last few years, with several major initiatives like the Goods and Services Tax, Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, digitalization, manufacturing sector push paving way for sustained economic growth.Experts also say that prudent fiscal and monetary policies have provided the foundation for a stable GDP growth.Sachchidanand Shukla - Group Chief Economist, L&T believes that India is one of the top players in the global growth league table today.“It is a result of structural reforms, policy continuity, and leveraging demographic and digital advantages. Key factors also include reforms such as: Goods and Services Tax, Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, Production-Linked Incentive and increased spending on infrastructure especially roads, railways, energy & defence,” he tells TOI.While the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code has significantly improved the health of the banking sector in India, the Goods and Services Tax is widely seen as the biggest indirect tax reform since independence. India’s GST collections in April hit a record all time high of Rs 2.37 lakh crore!Radhika Rao, Senior Economist at DBS Bank says that India’s trend growth continues to gain traction, strengthened by catalysts like investments into physical infrastructure, emphasis on improving human capital, streamlining direct subsidy transfers to beneficiaries, productivity gains from digitalisation, widening footprint in high value-added sectors including semiconductors, and expanding presence in global value chains.Also Read | Why India can be a big winner of Donald Trump 2.0 era if it plays its cards right “Equity markets have provided corporates with growth capital for investments, besides active participation of banks, private capital, and efforts to deepen the domestic corporate debt market,” she tells TOI.Ranen Banerjee, Partner, Government Sector Leader at PwC India explains that the positive cycle of a large young population has supported the continued consumption growth feeding into per capita income increase and consequently further boosting consumption. “This has helped and will continue to help in the growth of the Indian economy,” he tells TOI.The services sector growth leading to large employment in the ITES sector has led to a significant increase in middle income families further aiding growth.India may become the world’s 4th largest this year, but with the highest population in the world, its per capita GDP remains abysmally low.A large population (1.4 billion) dilutes gains of the GDP doubling. Also, informal employment (~90% of workforce) and low female workforce participation (26% vs. global 47%) limit per capita gains, says Sachchidanand Shukla.Still, the per capita income has close to doubled over the last 10 years. “That is keeping pace with the overall GDP growth as the population growth is slowing down with fertility rates going close to the replacement rate of 2.2. However, there are regional disparities owing to differential population growth rates as well as pace of economic development,” says Ranen Banerjee.India will realise its dream of becoming a $5 trillion economy in 2027 and the world’s third largest in 2028 by overtaking Germany. But to be on the path of stable and sustained economic growth, experts stress on the need for continuous reforms.PwC’s Ranen Banerjee advocates for reforms that enable private enterprise to do business without the fear by decriminalising regulatory compliances with application of technology to support in compliances.“Progressive labour reforms incrementally to allow for greater acceptance of the changes should be the way forward making these changes in special business enclaves. A disproportionate investment in skilling will be key to make the youth employable as it will lay the foundation of social stability and prosperity,” Ramen Banerjee says.Also Read | India has the world's 7th highest gold reserves! Why is RBI buying gold and how does it help the Indian economy? “Enabling exports through common facilities for quality outputs by MSMEs and continued investment in infrastructure to bring down logistics cost and enhance evacuation capabilities will be needed,” he adds.L&T’s Shukla says, “Going forward India will need to undertake deep agricultural reforms, labour reforms, education & skilling at a scale along with judicial administrative & police reforms,” he says.Radhika Rao of DBS Bank sees the need to focus on employment generation. “Wheels of the structural engine will require to be oiled by keeping the development and reform agenda on track. Quality of growth is also likely to improve as macro balances remain in check alongside a changing trade composition. Lifting employment generation and by extension boosting incomes will be the vital objective for the administration in the rest of its term,” she says.There is little doubt that India is amongst the most important markets for all economies globally including the US and China. A stable political scenario at the central government level over the last 11 years along with continued reforms have bolstered global investors’ confidence. But for the fruits of this growth to trickle down to the entire population, it is important to ensure employment for the youth and a strong manufacturing sector base for sustained, stable, and reliable economic growth.","India was the 10th largest world economy in 2014 - come 2025 it will be the 4th largest - a six places jump in rankings in just 11 years!

MUMBAI: The boards of Tata Trusts and Tata Sons will convene on Wednesday and Thursday to evaluate, among other things, a report acknowledging disclosure lapses by Tata Sons company secretary Suprakash Mukhopadhyay about his involvement and association with a wealth management firm owned by his family.The report, authorised by Tata Sons chairman N Chandrasekaran , follows concerns raised about Mukhopadhyay's connection to Divinion Advisory Services, potentially creating conflicts of interest with his role in the Tata system.Tata Trusts' executive trustee Mehli Mistry told TOI, ""I have complete faith and confidence in Chandra, the chairman of Tata Sons, to respond and handle such matters appropriately, as he deems fit and proper.""Prepared by three Tata Sons executives, the report has concluded that Mukhopadhyay's actions ""do not appear to be an intentional breach of the Tata code of conduct"". It, however, said Mukhopadhyay failed to inform Tata Sons about his role in facilitating or seeking investments for Divinion from former Tata employees and external parties associated with Tata Sons.The code of conduct states that conflicts of interest arise when employees secure improper benefits for themselves or family members.Non-disclosure of such conflicts, once discovered by management, could result in disciplinary actions. Listed companies face penalties from Sebi for disclosure failures.Some Tata executives confirmed investing in Divinion after being approached by Mukhopadhyay's daughter through her father, without knowing his connection to the firm.The report was shared with all Tata Sons board members. Though this is an internal Tata Sons matter, Tata Trusts as the largest stakeholder, has the heft to weigh in.

India-US trade treaty to energise exports: Finance ministry,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/india-us-trade-treaty-to-energise-exports-finance-ministry/articleshow/121451819.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: A successful US-India trade agreement could transform current headwinds into tailwinds, opening up new markets and energising exports, a finance ministry report said on Tuesday. However, it cautioned that global uncertainties remain.India and the US are engaged in talks to finalise a deal, with indications that the first phase is likely before July. The finance ministry's monthly report for April stated that the imposition of reciprocal tariffs by the US, particularly a 26% tariff on Indian imports effective April, has injected uncertainty into India's export outlook. Although a 90-day suspension of new tariffs is in place pending bilateral negotiations, the risk of renewed trade barriers remains a key external vulnerability.The report also noted that private sector capital expenditure could lag, with firms adopting a more cautious stance amid global uncertainty and tighter financial conditions. It highlighted that India has the potential to remain one of the most promising destinations for investment, despite global uncertainty.""Foreign direct investors are likely to respond positively to policies that strengthen the country's medium-term growth prospects.In particular, policies that enhance the skills and productivity of the country's young workforce can significantly strengthen the virtuous cycle of investment and growth,"" the report stated.As of April, India remains the fastest-growing major economy despite a revision of growth rates amid rising global uncertainties and trade tensions. Multiple agencies have projected India's growth to be in the range of 6.3-6.7% in FY26, supported by robust domestic fundamentals, stable macroeconomic management, and growing govt capital expenditure, while declining inflation strengthens this outlook.The report indicated that the outlook for food inflation is expected to remain benign due to a good rabi crop harvest, an increase in the area sown under summer crops, and healthy procurement of foodgrains. It mentioned that the forecast of an above-normal monsoon by the weather office bolsters this outlook.""The inflation outlook remains optimistic, supported by low core inflation and a decline in food prices. Going forward, inflationary pressures stemming from food items are expected to remain low due to a good rabi harvest, an increase in the area sown under summer crops, and healthy buffer stocks of foodgrains.""Recent RBI surveys indicate a decline in inflation expectations, adding to the overall positive sentiment. Amidst the declining inflation rate, the monetary policy setting is conducive for fostering economic growth,"" the report said, hinting at further easing of interest rates in the months ahead.","India and the US are engaged in talks to finalise a deal, with indications that the first phase is likely before July.

In March last year, London-listed BAT had pocketed about Rs 17,500 crore ($2.1 billion) by offloading 3.5% stake in ITC in one of the biggest block deals ever in India.After the latest block deal, BAT's holding in the Indian company will drop to 23.1% from 25.4%.

The transaction size is estimated at Rs 11,613 crore (around $1.4 billion).Investors buying into the sale will not be entitled to the recently announced dividend of Rs 7.9 per share, as the stock goes ex-dividend on May 28 and operates on a T+1 settlement cycle.BAT had earlier indicated that it was important for the company to retain 25% shareholding in ITC as it provides veto rights and influence on the board.On Tuesday, BAT said that the proceeds from the proposed sale will be used to ""progress within the target 2-2.5x adjusted net debt/adjusted EBITDA leverage corridor (adjusted for Canada) by the end of 2026 and to continue our sustainable buyback programme by enabling an intended 200 million pound increase in the share buyback to a total of 1.1 billion pounds in 2025.""

NEW DELHI: The income tax department has extended the deadline for filing of tax returns by individuals from July 31 to Sept 15 in the wake of several amendments to the law, which have necessitated revisions in the notified ITRs for this assessment year, requiring the authorities to rework the technology platform, among other things.""The notified ITRs for Assessment Year 2025-26 (FY2024-25) have undergone structural and content revisions aimed at simplifying compliance, enhancing transparency, and enabling accurate reporting. These changes have necessitated additional time for system development, integration, and testing of the corresponding utilities. Furthermore, credits arising from TDS statements, due for filing by May 31, 2025, are expected to begin reflecting in early June, limiting the effective window for returns filing in the absence of such extension,"" the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) said in a statement.For the last few years, the tax department has been sticking to the July 31 deadline meant for individuals who do not need to get audits done. The deadline covers the bulk of I-T returns filed during the year. Whenever the deadline has been extended in the past, it has happened quite late in the day. But this time the I-T department has opted to inform taxpayers early.""Given the requirements of these new ITR forms, the e-filing utility (both online and offline) needs to be updated by govt.Therefore, it is a very welcome move to extend the ITR filing deadline..., allowing taxpayers the time required to comply with these enhanced reporting requirements and legislative changes,"" said Sonu Iyer, partner and national leader for People Advisory Services-Tax at consulting firm EY India.""Given the complexity and increased reporting requirements in the revised ITR forms, including more granular disclosures of capital gains, foreign income, and asset ownership, the extension offers much-needed relief to taxpayers... taxpayers are advised to utilise this extended window to compile their financial data, reconcile necessary information, thereby minimising the risk of filing errors or omissions,"" said Sandeep Sehgal, tax partner at consulting firm AKM Global.","The income tax department has extended the deadline for filing of tax returns by individuals from July 31 to Sept 15.

India's trade deal with US could unlock new export and market opportunities: Finance ministry report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/indias-trade-deal-with-us-could-unlock-new-export-and-market-opportunities-finance-ministry-report/articleshow/121447910.cms,"India-US are in talks for trade deal (AI image)

A successful bilateral trade agreement between India and the US could transform current challenges into economic opportunities by expanding market access and boosting exports, according to the Finance Ministry's Monthly Economic Review released on Tuesday.The report comes amid ongoing negotiations between the two nations, with an interim trade agreement expected before July 8. India is seeking full exemption from a 26 per cent reciprocal tariff imposed by the US on domestic goods.The US had implemented the additional tariff on Indian products starting April 2, but suspended it for 90 days, until July 9. However, the baseline 10 per cent American tariff remains in effect.Despite global uncertainty, the report claimed India's position as a leading investment destination. It stated that foreign direct investors are likely to respond positively to reforms that strengthen medium-term growth prospects.The ministry emphasised the importance of policies aimed at improving the productivity and skills of the country’s young workforce- key factors in stimulating investment and economic growth.India continues to maintain its status as the world’s fastest-growing major economy, with relatively limited downward revisions in growth forecasts. According to the IMF's World Economic Outlook (April 2025), India's real GDP growth for FY26 is projected at 6.2 per cent, 30 basis points lower than the January estimate, amid rising global uncertainties and trade tensions.Various institutions forecast India's FY26 growth in the range of 6.3 to 6.7 per cent, underpinned by strong domestic fundamentals, prudent macroeconomic policies, higher government capital expenditure, and easing inflation.As of April 2025, the Indian economy demonstrates resilience, driven by robust private consumption, especially a rural rebound, and steady growth in services exports. ""The services sector continues to post healthy expansion, offsetting softness in merchandise exports. The Indian rupee has remained relatively stable, and foreign exchange reserves continue to provide a cushion against external shocks,"" the report stated.Government-led capital expenditure remains a key pillar of economic activity, helping shield the economy from external volatility. Direct tax incentives, fiscal measures, and the Reserve Bank of India's monetary policy are expected to further support consumption and investment. ""These could accelerate the recovery and push growth towards the upper end of forecasts, ranging from 6.3 per cent to 6.8 per cent, as cited in the latest Economic Survey,"" the report added.“This may be no moment for self-congratulation but, equally, it is a moment to remember one’s strengths and leverage them to make oneself not just attractive but also indispensable to investors,” it further observed.However, the ministry cautioned that private sector capital expenditure could remain subdued due to tighter global financial conditions and lingering uncertainty.On inflation, the outlook appears encouraging. The report pointed to low core inflation and softening food prices. Future inflation risks are expected to be contained due to a strong rabi harvest, expanded summer crop coverage, and sufficient foodgrain reserves.Additionally, the India Meteorological Department's forecast of above-normal monsoon rainfall and declining global crude oil prices are expected to further ease inflationary pressures.","Finance Ministry's Monthly Economic Review released on Tuesday.

Gold Trading Strategy:

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market and other asset classes given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)

Gold price prediction today: Gold rates have been fluctuating on the back of rapidly changing geopolitical situations, Donald Trump’s tariff moves and the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict. Gold is a safe haven investment in times of uncertainty, but the precious metal has been volatile in trade for the last few weeks after hitting lifetime highs. As investors it is important to watch out for cues.Gold prices had a volatile last week, briefly surging above $3,200 as investors sought safe-haven assets amid a firm U.S. dollar and geopolitical uncertainty, including hopes for a Russia-Ukraine ceasefire following President Trump's meetings with foreign officials.However, gains were short-lived, with gold falling over 2%, marking its worst weekly performance since last November, as risk appetite returned on signs of progress in U.S.-China trade talks.Moody’s downgrade of the U.S. sovereign credit rating added to market caution, citing concerns over mounting debt.Meanwhile, weaker-than-expected U.S. economic data—covering producer prices, retail sales, and industrial production—added to mixed sentiment.Debate intensified in Congress over President Trump’s proposed tax-cut bill, with uncertainty over its passage creating further volatility, especially after Trump warned of significant tax hikes if the bill fails. The U.S. dollar index remained below 100, while Treasury yields climbed sharply. Industrial metals and silver found support from a small cut in China’s loan prime rate, boosting broader economic sentiment. Although stronger dollar moves and profit-taking briefly weighed on gold, fiscal concerns and debt risks helped sustain its safe-haven appeal.Towards the end of the week, Trump threatened a 50% tariff on the EU and a 25% tariff on Apple if it shifts production to India. However, he later rescinded the EU tariff threat, giving the bloc until July to negotiate a trade deal, slightly easing global trade tensions.The upcoming week will focus on Fed speeches and key U.S. GDP, consumer confidence, Inflation and FOMC meeting minutes.Buy above 96,500 for targets of 98,000 and 99,000, strong support is near 94,800 and 93,800.","Gold prices had a volatile last week, briefly surging above $3,200.

Japan is no longer the world’s leading creditor nation - and that’s a first in 34 years! Germany has taken the top spot despite Japan's record overseas assets. Japan had held the top position since surpassing Germany in 1991.Japan's position as the world's leading net-creditor nation over the years was due to decades of current account surpluses, leading to substantial foreign investments by Japanese entities.According to the Ministry of Finance data quoted by Bloomberg, Japan's net external assets reached ¥533.05 trillion ($3.7 trillion) at the end of 2024, showing a 13% increase from the previous year. Although this figure was a record high, Germany surpassed it with net external assets of ¥569.7 trillion. China maintained its third position with net assets of ¥516.3 trillion.Germany's rise to the top position is attributed to its substantial current account surplus of €248.7 billion in 2024, primarily due to strong trade performance. In comparison, Japan's surplus was ¥29.4 trillion, approximately €180 billion, according to the finance ministry.The loss of this position indicates that whilst Japan's assets continue to grow, other nations, including Germany and China, have experienced stronger actual demand.Also Read | ‘Will not discuss…’: US tells WTO that India has no basis to impose retaliatory duties on 29 American products A nation's net foreign assets represent the difference between its overseas assets and domestic assets owned by foreigners, adjusted for currency value changes.

The ministry reported that Japanese firms maintained strong foreign direct investment in 2024, particularly in the US and UK markets, with substantial investments flowing into finance, insurance and retail sectors.Also Read | Explained in charts: India to become 4th largest world economy soon.

President Donald Trump's tariff policies might influence some firms to transfer assets or production to the US to address trade-related concerns.However, Karakama noted that these uncertainties might also lead some companies to prefer domestic operations and avoid higher-risk investments.","Germany has taken the top spot despite Japan's record overseas assets.

US consumer confidence rebounds sharply in May after prolonged slump,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-consumer-confidence-rebounds-sharply-in-may-after-prolonged-slump/articleshow/121441973.cms,"Representation Image

Consumer confidence in the United States saw a significant rebound in May, breaking a five-month streak of declines that had dragged sentiment to its lowest point since the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic.The Conference Board reported on Tuesday that its Consumer Confidence Index rose to 98, up from 85.7 in April, a 12.3-point increase and the largest monthly gain in over two years.The improvement comes as Americans grow more optimistic about the economy, with inflation easing slightly, job growth holding steady, and fears over former President Donald Trump’s tariff policies subsiding. In recent months, elevated prices- partly fueled by lingering tariffs on Chinese imports had heightened consumer anxiety and dampened economic outlooks, as reported by AP.A key sub-index tracking short-term expectations for income, business conditions, and the labor market surged 17.4 points to 72.8. Although still below the 80-point threshold that typically signals economic growth, the uptick marks a notable turnaround in public sentiment.The share of consumers expecting a recession within the next 12 months also declined, suggesting that Americans are feeling more hopeful about the near-term future.Consumer spending, which drives roughly two-thirds of US economic activity, could benefit from this renewed confidence. Economists and Federal Reserve officials will be closely watching upcoming data for signs that improving sentiment translates into stronger economic performance in the months ahead.Consumer confidence is an economic indicator that measures how optimistic or pessimistic consumers feel about their financial situation and the overall state of the economy, both in the present and in the near future.","The Conference Board reported on Tuesday that its Consumer Confidence Index rose to 98, up from 85.7 in April.

Gold vs Bitcoin: Why global central banks are choosing gold as dollar reserves dwindle,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/gold-vs-bitcoin-central-banks-buying-gold-not-bitcoin-dollar-loses-reserve-status-peter-schiff-analysis/articleshow/121436923.cms,"AI generated image

Gold’s stability outshines crypto volatility

As central banks worldwide accelerate their gold purchases to unprecedented levels and steer clear of Bitcoin, economist Peter Schiff sees a clear signal about the future of money.In a recent post on the social media platform X, the vocal gold advocate reignited the debate between traditional bullion and cryptocurrencies, questioning why global monetary authorities are increasingly relying on gold as a hedge against a post-dollar era.""If gold is the past and Bitcoin is the future, why are foreign central banks that are preparing for a future where the U.S. dollar is no longer the reserve currency, replacing their dollar reserves with gold and not Bitcoin?"" Economist Peter Schiff posted on X.Schiff’s comments come amid a sustained increase in central bank gold acquisitions, with annual purchases now exceeding 1,000 metric tons—more than double the decade-long average, according to Reuters. The economist, known for his scepticism toward cryptocurrencies, argues this trend reflects mounting distrust in the US dollar and underscores gold’s enduring role as a reliable reserve asset.In a follow-up post, Schiff pointed out, “The Dollar Index had its lowest weekly close in over three years, 30-year Treasuries had the lowest weekly close in almost two years, and gold had its highest weekly close ever.The world is divesting of US dollars and bringing their money home to buy gold and invest locally.”This gold accumulation is not a recent development. Nations like Russia have steadily expanded their gold reserves since 2014 to shield themselves from Western sanctions and geopolitical isolation. Schiff notes that this approach now serves as a model for other emerging markets, especially in light of ongoing global uncertainty fueled by former President Donald Trump's tariff-focused trade policies.Challenging Bitcoin’s status as the currency of the future, Schiff asks, “If Bitcoin is the future, why are central banks betting on gold to replace the dollar?” Despite Bitcoin’s recent price rally, which touched $108,148, central banks have yet to accept it as a dependable store of value.Gold’s appeal has been further strengthened by rising geopolitical risks, turbulent global bond markets, and uncertainty surrounding US fiscal policy. Schiff contrasts this with Bitcoin’s notorious price volatility and limited institutional trust, asserting, “Gold has proven itself as a safe asset during periods of tension,” citing its resilience through multiple economic cycles and financial crises.Gold prices saw a slight dip on Tuesday, with spot gold falling 0.5% to $3,325.99 per ounce, while US gold futures dropped 1.2% amid a rebound in the US dollar index. In India, June gold futures opened slightly higher at Rs 96,050 per 10 grams, recovering from a mid-May low.Despite the recent price decline, analysts believe gold remains firmly supported by broader macroeconomic concerns, reported ET. Manoj Kumar Jain from Prithvifinmart Commodity Research said, “Weakness in the dollar index, geopolitical tensions, and global uncertainty are supporting safe-haven buying for precious metals.” He added that gold could find strong support near $3,200 per troy ounce in upcoming sessions.Rahul Kalantri, VP Commodities at Mehta Equities, noted investor caution ahead of key US economic data releases, including the FOMC minutes and PCE inflation data. “A widening US deficit and geopolitical tensions continue to support gold, especially as markets weigh the Fed’s interest rate outlook,” he said.As central banks continue to articulate their long-term monetary strategies through record bullion purchases, Schiff’s pointed question remains: If cryptocurrencies are truly the future of money, why are governments doubling down on gold?","Central banks worldwide accelerate their gold purchases to unprecedented levels and steer clear of Bitcoin.

Markets brace for key economic data as trade tensions and Trump’s EU tariff reprieve test investor sentiment,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/wall-street-today-dow-nasdaq-trade-concerns-trump-delays-eu-tariffs-us-stock-market-update/articleshow/121416486.cms,"Photo -AP

US markets are set to test President Donald Trump’s announcement to delay a threatened 50 per cent tariff on European Union goods until July 9.Earlier, European stock markets rallied on Monday after US President Donald Trump postponed his threat to impose 50 per cent tariffs on European Union goods, pushing the deadline to July 9 to allow more time for negotiations. Trump had roiled markets late last week by warning that the steep duties could take effect from June 1, citing a lack of progress in trade talks with the EU.On Sunday, Trump eased investor concerns by announcing he would delay the tariffs after a ""very nice call"" with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. According to Trump, von der Leyen said she “wants to get down to serious negotiations.” In response, von der Leyen pledged to move “swiftly” to reach a deal.Following the news, the Paris CAC 40 index rose 1.2 per cent in midday trading, and Germany’s DAX gained 1.7 per cent, reflecting market optimism. While London and Wall Street remained closed for holidays, US futures climbed, although most Asian markets struggled to maintain gains.Analysts pointed to growing investor anxiety over the unpredictability of US trade policy. “The stock market seems to dance to Trump’s tune: first a threat, then a pullback, quickly followed by a rebound as speculative investors anticipate a concession,” said Jochen Stanzl, chief market analyst at CMC Markets.“This morning’s confirmation of such expectations reinforces the so-called ‘Trump Pattern’, which is increasingly seen as a successful strategy for risk-tolerant investors,” he added.Meanwhile, the US dollar remained under pressure following last week's drop. Concerns are also mounting over Trump’s fiscal strategy, particularly after long-term US Treasury yields surged last week. Investors fear that tax cuts and spending plans approved by the House could balloon the national debt.Markets are also bracing for key economic data this week. The Federal Reserve’s meeting minutes, due Wednesday, and Friday’s release of the US personal consumption expenditures index — the Fed’s preferred inflation measure — are likely to provide clues on the central bank’s policy outlook. These key events are expected to shape investor sentiment and the broader economic narrative moving forward.In corporate news, Samsung shares edged up 1 per cent in Seoul, despite being among the smartphone makers threatened with new US tariffs. In Tokyo, Nippon Steel saw a sharp rally, rising as much as 7.4 per cent before closing 2.1 per cent higher. This came after Trump voiced support for the Japanese firm's proposed $14.9 billion acquisition of US Steel, a deal he claimed would keep the US Steel headquarters in Pittsburgh and generate 70,000 jobs along with $14 billion in economic value. However, neither the White House nor the companies involved have released formal details of this proposed partnership.In currency markets, the euro rose to $1.1384, the pound edged up to $1.3563, and the dollar gained slightly to 142.84 yen.

Why it’s so hard to buy 'Made in America': Shoppers face tough choices despite strong intentions,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/why-its-so-hard-to-buy-made-in-america-shoppers-face-tough-choices-despite-strong-intentions/articleshow/121412982.cms,"For many Americans, buying products labelled “Made in the USA” is more than a patriotic act — it’s a commitment to supporting domestic workers and industries. But despite the desire, the reality of sticking to American-made goods is far more complicated than many expect.Dianna Huff, a 62-year-old New Hampshire resident, has spent more than a decade trying to buy only American-made products. While she’s succeeded with items like sheets, socks, and sofas, others — including her phone, glasses, and bathroom scale — have proven impossible to find without a foreign label. “It’s been a real journey that’s come with frustrations and misadventures,” Huff said as quoted by The Wall Street Journal.Her challenge reflects a broader trend. Global supply chains built over decades have made some categories nearly impossible to source domestically. For example, nearly half of all new passenger vehicles sold in the US in 2024 were assembled outside the country, according to S&P Global Mobility. Smartphones — nearly all of which are manufactured overseas — are another major hurdle.While many consumers are willing to pay more for American-made products, cost remains a barrier.A Morning Consult survey found that while more than half of US adults intentionally buy domestic goods at least sometimes, only 11% are willing to absorb a price increase of more than 15%. And for some items — like smartphones or certain tools — US-made versions are simply not available.Matt Braynard, a 47-year-old political consultant from Northern Virginia, has spent the last five years committed to buying American. He swapped imported designer clothes for US-made apparel, including jeans from Imogene + Willie, shirts from 1620 Workwear, and New Balance sneakers. While his choices cost more upfront, Braynard believes they last longer. “It isn’t always easy,” he said. “When I walk through a shopping mall… there’s really nothing for me there. ”Even committed shoppers make concessions. Anne Collins, 75, runs a Facebook group called Have Fun Buying Not Made in China. Though she’s helped members find US-made foil pans, artificial flowers, and mops, she admits that even her carefully curated Easter basket included some imported knickknacks.Despite increasing demand and political pushback — including steep tariffs threatened by President Donald Trump — rebuilding America’s manufacturing base will require more than consumer willpower. For now, living a truly “Made in America” life remains an admirable but difficult mission.",More than half of US adults intentionally buy domestic goods at least sometimes.

NEW DELHI: US President Donald Trump's wide-reaching tariff policies are beginning to take a toll on American consumers, with major companies announcing price hikes to counter rising import costs.Trump's administration has imposed a 10% baseline tariff on most imports and a 30% duty on Chinese goods, with some categories, such as steel and aluminum, facing even steeper rates.While a recent temporary deal reduced some tariffs on Chinese products, businesses are still grappling with increased costs and continued uncertainty over future trade policies.A growing number of major brands—including Walmart, Mattel, Ford, and Best Buy—have announced or hinted at price hikes as a direct result of Trump’s renewed tariff policies.The sweeping import duties, especially on goods from China, are pushing companies to pass rising costs on to consumers.Walmart said on April 15 it would raise prices due to “high” tariffs on Chinese-made products. CEO Doug McMillon stated that the company would try to keep prices low but acknowledged that “the magnitude of these tariffs makes it impossible to absorb all the pressure.”Mattel the toy giant behind Barbie, revealed plans on May 6 to increase prices, though it aims to keep 40–50% of its products priced under $20.CEO Ynon Kreiz said that although nearly half its products will still be priced under $20, others will increase in cost due to tariff pressures. He also called for the removal of tariffs on toys globally.Best Buy warned during its March earnings call that suppliers were increasing prices across product lines, with those costs likely to be passed on to consumers—especially if temporary exemptions for electronics expire.Shein and Temu popular Chinese e-commerce platforms, have also raised prices following Trump’s move to eliminate the “de minimis” exemption that spared low-cost imports from tariffs. Temu patio chairs jumped from $61.72 to $70.17, while Shein’s swimsuit sets saw a 91% price spike.Imported cars now face a 25% tariff, prompting Ford to raise vehicle prices up to 1.5% in the second half of 2025. Ford also confirmed sticker price hikes for three Mexico-made models. Subaru said it is adjusting prices on several models due to ""market conditions.""Ralph Lauren plans to increase prices more aggressively than previously planned. Adidas CEO Bjørn Gulden warned that tariffs would “eventually cause higher costs” across all US product lines. Nike is also set to raise prices starting June 1, though it did not officially link the move to tariffs.As tariffs reshape global supply chains and retail economics, consumers are already beginning to feel the impact at the checkout counter, and the trend may intensify if trade tensions escalate.","US President Donald Trump's wide-reaching tariff policies are beginning to take a toll on American consumers.

Nissan bets on hybrid e-Power technology to drive turnaround amid financial struggles,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/nissan-bets-on-hybrid-e-power-technology-to-drive-turnaround-amid-financial-struggles/articleshow/121411794.cms,"Struggling Japanese automaker Nissan is banking on its proprietary ""e-Power"" hybrid technology to help fuel a much-needed business revival. The technology, already available in select models, uses both an electric motor and a gasoline engine—similar to Toyota’s Prius—but operates differently in a key way: the car is always powered by the electric motor, providing a consistently quiet and smooth driving experience.“Nissan has a proud history of pioneering innovative technology that set us apart,” said Chief Technology Officer Eiichi Akashi during a media event at the company's Grandrive test track outside Tokyo, AP reported.Unlike typical plug-in EVs, e-Power vehicles don’t require external charging. The battery is powered solely by the gasoline engine, allowing drivers to refuel at gas stations without worrying about charging infrastructure—offering a unique middle ground between conventional hybrids and full electric vehicles Nissan Motor Corp., which posted a $4.5 billion loss for the fiscal year ending in March, is pinning its hopes on e-Power as part of a broader turnaround strategy. The company faces significant challenges in the U.S. market, where President Donald Trump's tariff policies have complicated matters for Japanese automakers.To reverse its fortunes, Nissan is pursuing cost-cutting initiatives, strengthening partnerships, and reshaping its vehicle lineup—with e-Power technology playing a key role in that effort, according to Akashi.As part of its recovery plan, Nissan recently announced it would cut 15% of its global workforce—around 20,000 employees—and reduce its manufacturing footprint from 17 plants to 10. The restructuring is being led by new Chief Executive Ivan Espinosa.Currently, e-Power technology is available in the Nissan Qashqai and X-Trail in Europe, and the Note in Japan. The U.S. market will see the upgraded system introduced in the upcoming Rogue model. While pricing for the new e-Power vehicles has not yet been disclosed, the only other automaker offering a similar setup is Suzuki Motor Corp., which incorporates it in its compact ""kei"" cars.Nissan, an early innovator in electric vehicles with the launch of the Leaf in 2010, is also working on enhanced EV models and is developing solid-state batteries—a potential replacement for the lithium-ion batteries now used in EVs, hybrids, and e-Power systems.Despite these efforts, analysts caution that Nissan is facing serious financial risks and may soon need external support. Speculation has emerged that the company may sell its Yokohama headquarters building or repurpose one of its domestic factories into a casino to raise funds.The company was previously in discussions with rival Honda Motor Co. regarding a possible business integration but announced in February that those talks had been called off.","Nissan is banking on its ""e-Power"" hybrid technology to help fuel a much-needed business revival.

Travel outlook

Memorial Day, which had traditionally been observed on May 30 to honor America’s fallen service members, officially became a federal holiday in 1971 and is now held on the last Monday in May. Over the years, it has also become one of the busiest weekends for retail sales and travel across the United States.All government offices, including post offices, courts, and public schools, will be closed for the holiday.US stock markets and most banks will be closed on Monday.FedEx and UPS will not offer regular pickup and delivery services, although some specialized services may still be available, according to an AP report.Most major retailers will remain open, many offering Memorial Day sales to attract shoppers. Warehouse club Costco will be closed. Store hours may vary depending on location.Memorial Day also marks the unofficial start of the summer travel season. This year, Americans are expected to hit the road and skies in record numbers despite economic concerns and recent disruptions in the travel sector.AAA forecasts that more than 45 million people will travel at least 50 miles from home between Thursday and Monday — 1.4 million more than last year — setting a new Memorial Day travel record. The previous record of 44 million domestic travellers was set two decades ago.Drivers will likely pay less for fuel than last year. According to AAA’s fuel tracker, the national average for a gallon of regular gas was $3.18 on Wednesday, down from $3.60 at the same time last year.An estimated 39.4 million people are expected to travel by car, the highest number recorded for Memorial Day since AAA began tracking in 2000. Air travel is also up slightly, with 3.61 million expected to fly — nearly 2% more than the 3.55 million who travelled by air last year.Traveller confidence in air safety has been shaken by a number of recent incidents, including a deadly mid-air collision in January between a passenger jet and a US Army helicopter over Washington, D.C., which killed 67 people.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor ( CEA ) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September.

That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says. Udaan competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods. The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-105001128,imgsize-151312,width-400,resizemode-4/105001128.jpg"

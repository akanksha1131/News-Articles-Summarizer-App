New excise duty on tobacco products: Cigarette prices to increase up to Rs 55 per pack,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/new-excise-duty-on-tobacco-products-cigarette-prices-to-increase-up-to-rs-55-per-pack/articleshow/127842714.cms,"Growth Momentum Will Continue Says FM Sitharaman As Budget 2026 Bets On Tech Cities And Reforms

After the new excise duty regime kicked in, cigarette prices have gone up, with a pack of 10 sticks now costing at least Rs 22–25 more than before.This follows the government’s decision to raise taxes on cigarettes for the first time in nearly seven years, bringing India’s tobacco taxation closer to global public health norms. The new levies, approved by Parliament in December, will replace the existing GST compensation cess framework that has been in place since the rollout of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) in July 2017.The increase in cigarette prices will vary depending on the length and type of cigarette.According to distributors, premium cigarettes of 76 mm length will now cost Rs 50–55 more per pack of 10 sticks, depending on the brand.While manufacturers are yet to issue revised MRP declarations, distributors have begun billing old stock to retailers with 40% GST.With wholesale markets shut on Sunday, distributors expect fresh stock with new MRPs to be lifted from Monday onwards.According to news agency PTI, a packet of Wills Navy Cut (76 mm), earlier priced at Rs 95 per pack of 10 sticks, is expected to cost around Rs 120 per pack.Cigarettes of 84 mm length—such as Gold Flake Kings and Lights, Wills Classic and Wills Classic Milds—currently priced at Rs 170 per pack of 10 sticks, are expected to cost between Rs 220 and Rs 225 per pack.Similarly, slim cigarettes such as Classic Connect (97 mm), priced at Rs 300 for a pack of 20 sticks, are expected to have an MRP of around Rs 350, the report said.However, distributors fear that the price hikes could lead to increased smuggling and the spread of counterfeit products. According to the All India Cigarette and Tobacco Distributors Federation (AICPDF), there are around 8,000–9,000 stockists of cigarettes and tobacco products across the country.“Some companies have already put their stocks on hold. They will start releasing them after billing under the new tax structure,” a stockist told PTI.“Tobacco products are among the few categories where small shopkeepers are still relevant. If this too is pushed into the hands of illicit networks, what will be left for honest retailers? This is not just about taxation—it is about survival,” he said.From February 2026, cigarettes and tobacco products will attract additional excise duty and cess over and above the highest 40% GST slab, replacing the current structure of 28% GST plus compensation cess.The Central Excise Act has also been amended to impose a per-stick excise duty on cigarettes, with rates varying according to length.",A pack of 10 sticks now costs at least Rs 22–25 more than before.

Trump Announces India-US Trade Deal, Reduces Reciprocal Tariffs On Delhi To 18%; PM Modi Reacts

‘Well played, President Trump’

Trump’s claims on India-US Trade Deal

India-US trade deal: Lindsey Graham, the US Senator, who was propagating a bill that would impose 500% tariffs on countries buying Russian crude oil has said that India has ‘earned’ the tariff reduction to 18%. , stepping up purchases of US oil, probability of India buying Venezuelan oil in the future, committing to $500 billion purchase of US energy, technology, coal, and agricultural products, and India bring down tariffs on US goods to zero.Prime Minister Narendra Modi welcomed the trade deal and called the reduction in tariff rate on India to 18% a ‘wonderful announcement’. However, PM Modi’s social media post on X (formerly Twitter), did not mention any promises on Russian crude etc.“Wonderful to speak with my dear friend President Trump today. Delighted that Made in India products will now have a reduced tariff of 18%. Big thanks to President Trump on behalf of the 1.4 billion people of India for this wonderful announcement. When two large economies and the world’s largest democracies work together, it benefits our people and unlocks immense opportunities for mutually beneficial cooperation.President Trump’s leadership is vital for global peace, stability, and prosperity. India fully supports his efforts for peace. I look forward to working closely with him to take our partnership to unprecedented heights,” PM Modi posted on X.Also Read | India-US trade deal: Top 7 points Trump says he agreed on with PM Modi US Senator Lindsey Graham linked the trade deal to India lowering crude oil imports from Russia, and hailed Trump’s pressure tactics. In a post on X, Graham commended US President Donald Trump ’s strategy, arguing that applying economic pressure on countries purchasing Russian energy is starting to deliver results.""Well played, President Trump. I think your message about ending this war--by having Putin's customers who prop up his war machine have to recalculate--is working,"" he said.Graham added that India’s actions had more than warranted the tariff relief and expressed hope that other major buyers of Russian oil would take a similar path.""Through their behavior, India has more than earned this reduction. I'm hoping that the other big nations that buy Russian oil will follow India's direction,"" Graham added.Placing the development within a wider geopolitical context, the senator said meaningful negotiations with Russian President Vladimir Putin would only happen once pressure becomes overwhelming.""Putin will only come to the table when the pain is so great. We're not there yet, but with India's actions, we are moving closer. End the bloodbath in Ukraine now,"" he said.Trump said the United States and India had “agreed to a trade deal,” under which Washington would lower the reciprocal tariff on Indian goods from 25% to 18% citing “friendship and respect” for PM Modi.In a post on Truth Social, Trump referred to a conversation he had with Modi earlier in the day, describing the Indian Prime Minister as one of his closest friends and a strong and widely respected leader. He also asserted that Modi had committed to halting purchases of Russian oil and significantly increasing imports from the United States.Also Read | Lower than Pakistan, China: In trade deal with US, India secures a favourable tariff rate Trump further stated that India would move to ease both tariff and non-tariff restrictions on American products as part of the agreement.""It was an Honor to speak with Prime Minister Modi, of India, this morning.

Small taxpayers can obtain lower TDS certificate electronically,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/small-taxpayers-can-obtain-lower-tds-certificate-electronically/articleshow/127875204.cms,"Representative image

Budget 2026: Indian FM’s Huge Income Tax Announcement | Latest Slabs, Old & New Regime Rates

In a relief to small taxpayers, the finance minister has proposed to give them an option to file applications for obtaining lower or nil TDS certificates electronically.A taxpayer typically applies for a lower or nil TDS certificate when their actual tax liability for the year is lower than the standard TDS rate (or nil) so that excess tax is not deducted upfront and blocked as a refund.Presently, under Section 395 of the Income-Tax Act, small taxpayers have to approach their jurisdictional income-tax officer to file a manual application to obtain such a certificate. The process involves follow-ups, and delays. Under the proposed framework, the payee may file an application electronically before the prescribed income-tax authority, which may issue the certificate electronically, subject to the fulfillment of prescribed conditions.Explaining the proposal, Dipesh Jain, Partner, Economic Laws Practice, said, “The amendment is a targeted compliance-relief measure introduced for small taxpayers as an alternative to the existing manual process. The change is expected to enhance ease of compliance without diluting the substantive safeguards governing grant of such certificates.” While Ameet Patel, partner at Manohar Chowdhry & Associates, welcomed the move, he said, “Going by experience, it would be interesting to see how this would work practically. How much will the applicant be able to explain through electronic means is a big question mark. Like all faceless initiatives, this too is a noble one. But whether it becomes a boon or a bane - only time will tell.”","The finance minister has proposed to give them an option to file applications for obtaining lower or nil TDS certificates electronically.

No tax on compensation received from govt on acquisition of land,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/no-tax-on-compensation-received-from-govt-on-acquisition-of-land/articleshow/127874119.cms,"Budget 2026: Indian FM’s Huge Income Tax Announcement | Latest Slabs, Old & New Regime Rates

Is govt eyeing your land? Worried about paying tax on compensation you’ll receive? Not anymore. The Budget 2026 has brought an important amendment exempting compensation received on compulsory acquisition of land under Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013 (RFCTLARR Act).The proposal says the relief will be applicable to individuals and HUFs. With govt pushing for infrastructure development sin urban areas such as metro train networks, industrial corridors and the like, land acquisition is on a rise. The proposal is expected to help landowners. However, this relief will not apply to acquisitions by private players or through mixed structures.On the proposal, Rahul Charkha, partner at Economic Laws Practice, said, “The amendment incorporates the exemption that was earlier provided under Section 96 of the RFCTLARR and CBDT Circular 36/2016. The amendment also considers a decision of the tax tribunal (Amritsar Bench) wherein it was held that compensation from compulsory acquisition of land under the National Highways Act is exempt from income tax by virtue of Section 96 of the RFCTLARR, 2013. The relief is broader than the old capital-gains exemption for specified agricultural land. It will help owners of non-agricultural, and urban land acquired for roads, rail, metro, industrial corridors and other public projects.”","The Budget 2026 has brought an important amendment exempting compensation received on compulsory acquisition of land.

CBIC chairman

Vivek Chaturvedi

is confident about meeting Budget targets and details number of

reform measures

that have been announced to shore up approvals using technology. Excerpts:

A number of reform measures have been announced on the Customs side in the Budget. What is the strategy behind this?

There is a lot of emphasis on using technology to speed up approvals. What are the next steps?

Are you confident of meeting the Budget targets on the Customs duty receipts for FY27?

How do you see

GST revenues

after rate rationalisation?

■ The FM, in her budget announcement, said, the focus is definitely on Customs, primarily on two parts. One is a lot of Customs duty exemptions on goods and the second is simplification of processes and trying to ease certain pain points which could lead to bottlenecks, which could lead to faster dwell time of cargo, ease of congestion, quicker turnaround time for businesses. Both sets of measures also complement each other.Now on the rates part, it’s been a very carefully calibrated and nuanced approach that we have taken. It’s not really a rationalisation whole hog if you look at it. It’s been very specific. We’ve looked at our energy security. We’ve done away with Customs duties for setting up nuclear power plants. We have provided exemption for import of monazite which is a critical rare earth and goes into manufacture of magnets for electric vehicles. There are several measures that have been announced.For ease of living, we have done reforms on baggage rules that will help people who travel abroad, tourists. Since 2016 baggage rules have not been amended. There was a 10-year hiatus.■ We already have a strong IT backbone. What is currently the state of play is that it’s dispersed. We are trying to create one integrated system. There is a two year time frame for this.The expression of interests are out and we hope to have vendors appointed soon. The idea, to have an integrated application and it will lead to a better user experience, faster turnaround time, and more agility. If I need to assess a risk, why should I have a half an hour window for assessing a risk? The risk assessment should be instantaneous. We are trying to do. Once we are able to further strengthen the IT backbone, we will also be in a position to also roll out more and more agile services to our stakeholders.■ We have been very conservative in our estimates. The targets will be met.■ Look, if you look at the collection figures that came on Sunday, they are more or less comparable, slightly more than the figures of Jan 25. And Jan 25 was prior to the rationalisation. With this sort of developments on the supply side and the way revenues are, if not in immediate terms, gradually things will pick up and ultimately we should have resilience of the economy and growth of GDP taking care of revenue buoyancy.","CBIC chairman Vivek Chaturvedi is confident about meeting Budget targets.

"‘PPPs in railways should start, Delhi station likely on the list’: V Vualnam - The Times of India",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/interview-ppps-in-railways-should-start-delhi-station-likely-on-the-list-v-vualnam/articleshow/127874225.cms,"Finance ministry secretary V Vualnam (File photo)

Expenditure secretary V Vualnam says fiscal prudence was a clear priority for govt and within the constraints of the Budget, it has rolled out support for critical sectors. Excerpts:

Can you help us understand the overall strategy behind the spending plan? How much flexibility on raising capex does govt have given the committed spending towards salaries, pension and interest payments?

What about committed spending?

Do you think this has peaked given the fact that in the last two years you were near the target but not fully achieved it?

How do you see the absorptive capacity in Railways, metro rail networks or there’s need to shift focus?

So will there be more PPPs in Railways?

What kind of projects would these be? Will it include tracks?

■ The key point is that the focus on capex is clear. In midst of all uncertainties, capex and building up infrastructure is well recognised everywhere. It has a multiplier effect, the way it helps all parts of economy. It is a recognition of that and the commitment to ensure that that continues and therefore increase is also based on that line of thinking.■ That constraint or tightness remains. It's a reality. But within that we have managed fairly well. The fiscal prudence side was a clear priority for the finance minister and for everyone in govt. We have been able to focus and support sectors and interventions which are a priority, like the rare earth corridor.■ I would not say yes or no because infrastructure should be created and the Budget provides for capex. Within that financing structures are also changing, and new modalities are coming up. Highways are quite advanced now into various types of PPP. So, the Rs 2 lakh crore we give, something more is added or annuity is stretched out and therefore they are able to do this.■ Absorptive capacity is there, especially the railways. Our country requires it.Dedicated freight corridor, whatever is getting ready, is promising. The almost doubling of average speed which freight trains are able to achieve inside the dedicated freight corridor is something which is really transformative.The financing structure is something we no longer would like to go in the old style of everything being EPC (engineering, procurement and construction) contracts. In highway sector we found that, not only financing, quality of construction also improves. There's a stake in maintaining it for 15 years or the period that is mentioned in the contract. These are the benefits of this kind of collaboration.■ In Railways it should start. Once it starts it will move well. You know it's an engineering, qualified team. A team which is handling ops at a high volume. The bandwidth is there. It is just that the mechanism has to come into place. They have prepared a cabinet note on PPP.■ It can be practically anything. Station development is one of the immediate possibilities. The potential is huge. The kind of business that they do: passenger traffic, cargo, there is enough. On station development, Bhopal is a beginning, and a lot of learnings will come from that. They've identified New Delhi. They are trying again now.","Expenditure secretary V Vualnam says fiscal prudence was a clear priority for govt.

Economic Affairs secretary

Anuradha Thakur

expects foreign capital inflows to improve on the back of Budget measures that have been unveiled and is confident that the growth momentum will sustain. Excerpts:

Given the challenges that the economy faces, how do you see the growth-inflation dynamics playing out in the short term?

Under the flexible

inflation targeting

mechanism is the Centre comfortable with headline inflation as anchor for the monetary policy committee and has the 2-6% worked or does it need to be narrowed?

Do you see an improvement in inflows given what is happening around the world?

On asset monetisation and divestment, what is the way forward given the fact that there are plans to raise Rs 80,000 crore in next financial year?

■ I do see core inflation stabilising but we don’t want inflation to reach those highs again because it really hurts the poor. It has rightly been called the “Goldilocks moment” by the RBI governor (Sanjay Malhotra). We can manage the growth that we are aiming at because I would probably call it a stimulus kind of approach that govt has been following year after year, referring to the high capex levels and also the uptick that I’m seeing in private investment.■ The plus minus 2% range has worked for us. Second, in terms of headline or core, the thought process has been that it has held us in good stead. Headline inflation reflects the lived experience of inflation better than core inflation. We would think that there is a case for continuing with that.■ I’ll make a distinction between foreign direct investment (FDI) and foreign portfolio investment (FPI). FPI, by its very nature, is cyclical and we are right now in a cycle in which FPIs are pulling out. Some of it is because of the fact that they have had a good experience in India and they are repatriating their profits.Hopefully, from those jurisdictions there will be more inflow as the cycle turns. There are other things as well, including interest rate regimes in other countries, high valuations, which has also allowed them to book profits. But the valuations are also moderating.On the FDI side, gross flows have been stable and high. Net FDI, at different points of the year, has either been neutral or a little bit below or even sometimes a little bit higher. Powering ahead with the kind of interventions we have tried to make in the Budget, the sectors that we have chosen with care, should attract a lot more FDI in the year. Chemicals and biopharma are sectors where we hope to see significant investments.■ Secretary DIPAM has said that the target includes asset monetization as well. Asset monetization has also developed as a route for monetization. Sector specialists say they are also feeling more confident about how to monetize. This year probably we’ll see more asset monetization.We specifically identified CPSE REITs (real estate investment trusts) because it is our thinking in DEA at least that we build buildings to be able to sit in those buildings. You don’t have that stream of rental income that can be made into a REIT. There are mechanisms through which you can do that, which is why we announced it. We will now be sharing what we have learned with DIPAM and department of public enterprises so that they can take it forward. We hope that after a few pilots that will open up this significant chunk of assets. Not land, but buildings that you’re sitting in.","Anuradha Thakur expects foreign capital inflows to improve on the back of Budget measures. She is confident that the growth momentum will sustain.

You have presented nine Budgets. How difficult is policy-making or Budget-making against the backdrop of how the world has changed?

Given your track record in achieving Budget targets, have you been a little conservative with your estimates on deficit and tax, which included significant giveaways this year due to income tax and GST reduction?

What kind of measures should we expect on widening the tax base?

You spoke about helping small taxpayers with compliance and easier filing. What kind of income level are you looking at?

Decriminalisation in the income tax law was a major announcement. You spoke about maximum two-year jail and no rigorous imprisonment. How will this work? Will the income tax department be less aggressive?

There is a lot of focus on simplifying customs processes and reposing more trust. You had reduced the number of slabs last year. Going forward, will you rewrite the law and reduce slabs further?

You have persisted with robust capex. Is there firepower in case the global situation turns adverse? Are you seeing a pick-up in private sector investments?

You have pitched it as a Yuva Shakti Budget. What prompted you to focus on youth?

There is a partnership on education and skilling. How can the private sector help in this?

What will be the focus of the orange economy?

Is this to prepare the workforce for the future and also fill the skill gap, especially in areas where there may be challenges in future such as geriatrics?

On STT, you have stated that the intent is to protect retail investors from excessive speculation. Could this have been handleddifferently, since some foreign investors — who are already exiting the market — will have to face additional costs?

You have introduced capital gains tax on sovereign gold bonds for those who purchase from the secondary market. What is the intent behind the move?

Gold and silver prices have gone up significantly and anecdotally, it appears that some investors are getting overexuberant about getting into these two commodities. Is there a need to sensitise investors?

Given that we are signing several FTAs, have you also factored them to prepare industry to take advantage of these agreements?

You have not made specific reference to the states despite elections in five states. Why?

Some people said that you wore a

Kanjivaram

sari for Tamil Nadu and not one from Bengal. Last year you wore a Madhubani sari. You didn’t name the states.

You have allocated Rs 95,000 crore for G Ram G. The opposition has raised its concern over the scheme, including on cost-sharing between the Centre and the states. How do you respond to it?

Can you help us understand the disinvestment and asset monetisation plan? Also, do instruments like REITs address concerns that officers have on land sale or PSU privatisation?

One of the success stories last year was the turnaround of power discoms due to reforms-linked incentives to states and also regulations issued by the Centre. Does this focus need to continue?

Last time, when the Finance Commission report had come, the Centre was attacked and now balance seems to have been restored. But states, irrespective of political colour, have demanded an increase in the share, while the Centre has argued that it has to meet defence and other spending needs, including those related to health, education and even jobs.

You have announced several steps but you did not undertake major reforms in the Budget and instead sought to steady the ship, taking a middle path...

Govt has rationalised subsidies in the oil sector, but not so much in food and in fertiliser. It’s a politically difficult thing to do. Given that poverty levels have come down, when can the Centre and statesdecide on beneficiaries, because some of the people may not need that subsidy now?

Net FDI has been a bit of a concern. The focus is on increasing inward FDI. How much of a dampener is the current global environment and how will you pitch India as a more attractive destination?

How much of a policy concern is outward FPI flow and the impact that it is having on the rupee and the overall sentiment?

Will the high-level committee look only at banking reforms or on the financial sector as a whole?

How will the infrastructure risk fund work?

You have presented nine Budgets; which one do you see as a milestone?

All constructive?

A day after presenting her ninth Budget , finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman spoke at length on a range of topics with TOI’s Sidhartha and Surojit Gupta. While she is confident the domestic situation is under control, she feels her biggest challenge ‘will be external’FM: It’s largely the global situation rather than domestic factors. Domestic situation is well under control in terms of supply-side problems and inflation; consumption has had a good boost. The latest GST numbers show that consumption is sustained at the level that is giving good yields. So, my challenge will be external.Yes, there are new challenges because of changes in the world. Even at the time of Covid, Budget-making was a challenge. Post revival, we thought of how to step up growth and sustain it — even that was a challenge. Every Budget has its own set of challenges, and it is not just because of global uncertainty.Beyond this, I will be stretching my assessment. You have rightly pointed to tax giveaways. GST will not immediately give a big number (collection after rate rejig), although Jan’s data surprised everybody. So, I have to be realistic. I will have to work to expand the tax base on the direct tax side and build a land monetisation pipeline.Two or three things, which are already in practice but will mature. Using information from AI data analytics, you are able to see where money is being spent and you can check if a return is filed. If not, there will be a nudge pointing to the expenditure. The logic behind connecting TDS to large expenditures will be carried forward. If you have assets abroad, please disclose them. That’s not to say we are going to go after everybody. There will also be deep tech analysis of who’s spending huge amounts and then we will approach taxpayers or non-payers and convince them to come on board and widen the base.Tax mitras will help many small businesses, which want assistance and want to be confident about the returns. That is why through the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India, cost accountants, or ICSI, we want to come up with a set of professionals who offer service at an affordable rate so that small businesses can seek their help and are assured that it is being done by a professional. We received suggestions in this regard and that’s why we decided on this.We’ll pursue where we need to pursue but not excessively go after (people). The judiciary can, of course, look at the gravity of the offence and then decide if imprisonment is needed or not and if it can be converted into some kind of penalty. We’ll give an option of paying a fee and get away without going to jail. For a few offences, imprisonment provision will still be there, may be cases of fraud or some other serious offence. It will be for the court to decide on imprisonment or letting a person pay some money and go away.That’s been happening for the last two years. They are already working on it (rewriting). Some are disclosed in this Budget; they (the department) will carry forward that work. It’s time-consuming work.There is certainly a pick-up in private sector investments. I hope, with the kind of India’s domestic market and the robustness seen in exports, there will be further growth in private investments.We received so many inputs from them. The PM participated in the My Bharat dialogue. For education, skilling and entrepreneurship, we have set up a standing committee. You will be able to acquire skills before completing your education and it will help you become an entrepreneur. Two-three ministries will work together. Youth is not just about men. In rural areas, there are several Lakhpati Didis. In Nagaland, due to the rural employment programme, many have become businesswomen. There is a way to move from self-help groups to entrepreneurship, that’s why SHE-Marts came about.I have announced waterways, which pass through the mineral corridor and some, where Nishads live. This community is skilled in repairing and making boats. At the institutes of excellence, they can acquire further skills on maintenance and other aspects. Seaplanes in coastal areas will also create jobs for the youth.We are working with industry on skilling, because in this age of technology, govt can’t work alone. Industry’s requirements are continuously evolving.It will be on AVCG, animation, cartoon videography and gaming. In Japan, Studio Ghibli has been able to integrate man-made pictures with technology and share Ramayana. We need to do all this in India. The idea is not just about content creators but there are several other elements.India’s population is aging and there will be a need for services for which manpower should be made ready. We are constantly, and rightly so, looking to educate children to become doctors and nurses and we still need to support that. But we also need paramedics, physiotherapists, psychologists, radiologists. Even that cadre needs support. That is why we made a mention of that one lakh additional Allied Health Professionals.They are not coming into options. Can we compensate 90% of the retail investors who are losing money in the F&O segment? It is not for the cash segment. We have only touched the F&O trade, which is highly speculative. I have received calls from many parents saying their children are severely losing money, and also seeking govt intervention. The STT hike in F&O will act as a deterrence so that people do not go headlong with that.Original intent was that you will hold the bonds till maturity. It’s not buying and selling, we were asking you to invest and leave it there.I don’t think we have seen individual citizens buying and selling. Gold price is fluctuating in the global market because of different reasons. Even central banks in various countries are investing in gold. Investment by consumers in gold is a personal choice.Very clearly, we are supporting labourintensive sectors such as leather, textile, sports goods, marine products and shrimps. It will boost exports.(Laughs) We have steps for electionbound states. Mineral corridor, rare earth corridor for Kerala and Tamil Nadu. Actually, others can complain that Tamil Nadu has got defence and a rare earth corridor. Kerala economy depends on coconut, somewhat Tamil Nadu. Cashew for Kerala.I can’t wear three saris on the same day. I mentioned Kerala, Tamil Nadu and in West Bengal Dankuni, Durgapur, Siliguri. I mentioned high-speed train in Chennai.It shows that we are committed to the cause of taking care of people who need jobs on demand. When we hiked it to 125 days from 100 days, people said, how will we do it. We allocated the money to meet that demand. We have also given money for that old scheme, MNREGA, because payment has to be made. Utilisation certificates will come later, so we are not denying that money, it’s a substantial amount. I have allocated Rs 95,000 crore for VBG RAM G and Rs 30,000 crore for MNREGA. So, let us see what campaign they want to run now. In their tenure, having brought this law, they didn’t give one-tenth of this. Even though 100 days was promised, the demand was less.The demand was spurious; CAG also commented on it. Someone over 80 years old was going to dig ponds, they are all getting funds under MNREGA. That is why, in this scheme, we have brought a setup where the state govt also has a skin in the game. You think in states like Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Jharkhand, there will be large demand for work under MNREGA, but demand is not so much. States, which say we are developed, we are contributing to GDP but don’t get that kind of money back (from the Centre), see demand under MNREGA go up so much. So, these things will get controlled.You spoke of REITs by central PSUs. Will it be a significant part of the Rs 80,000 crore that you have budgeted for under assetmonetisation. You also mentioned more public floats by PSUs.As an instrument REIT has worked well. Pension funds which come into India also have confidence that the instrument is very effective and they will be happy to invest. On your point on officers being more comfortable, I understand that, but it is not for that reason that a substantial number of land monetisation work has not happened. Some departments which have enough land assets are unable to carve out land parcels due to litigation or are not free of encumbrances. You need a pipeline with parcels or assets that are encumbrance-free; only then can you find an interested buyer. In the past, progress has been affected due to these sorts of things.Yes, this has to continue; it has to be sustained.First, I won’t comment on the Finance Commission report. Cabinet has seen it, approved it and that is why I tabled it in the House. It won’t be right on my part to comment on a constitutional body’s recommendation. The Centre will have to look at its revenue sources and that’s why disinvestment and other things, non-tax revenue, will actually be improved upon. Without that we are going to have to face a lot of challenges because our demands are mounting whether it is defence, whether it is pay commission which is yet to submit its report. Whether it is also skilling or health activities, or the semiconductor mission, agriculture and farming or R&D, all need to get support. Central govt is funding and that cannot come down. So, we will have to look at sources of revenue.There are reforms outside the Budget, too. It is not middle path. Since 2014, we have undertaken several reforms outside the Budget, labour codes, IBC, GST. Even now, IBC has returned from IBC, we are planning to amend the Companies Act. There is a lot of reform outside the Budget. We focus a lot on the Budget, and rightly so, but you need to factor in reforms outside the Budget, too. Reforms are for the development of the country and for faster growth. Whatever is needed will be done.That’s a call which different ministries will have to sit together and take. I am not commenting either this way or that way, but it involves so many different factors. We also need the Census data because we still have 2011 data and it’s been 15 years since then. The new Census itself will give us some direction on how many people are below poverty (line), what is the kind of spread there, and where they are present.Globally, fund movement is determined by the strategic considerations elsewhere, not just for India. Second, the reason why we are constantly talking about part B of the Budget is because of the various proposals that we have come up with for making India a better destination for investment, for job creation. Steps are taken with an expectation that we will be able to get over some of the systemic glitches which existed earlier. We are moving in the direction of making India a better and attractive investment destination, but fund flows depend on many other factors, which are beyond India. Norway and Canada are speaking to me, speaking to the commerce minister (Piyush Goyal) on investing more in India and how we can facilitate that. We are working with the counterparts concerned to enable that.I am here to make sure that the macroeconomic fundamentals are strengthened. Policy will enable it. Ease of doing business will make India an attractive destination. Funds come, funds go and I am not saying it is not important. We need funds. We welcome them and we will work to get them.Banking. Basically, it will help us prepare the roadmap for 2047Many of the risk which investors face will have to be supported by some measure or the other. That’s why we have come up with this. The finer details are being worked out.Each Budget is a challenge. Each Budget is a sort of rigorous exercise. And I have a sense of satisfaction about each of them for the context in which they were made.I am not sure if any of my Budgets were populist, all of them have sought to be constructive.","Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman spoke at length on a range of topics with TOI’s Sidhartha Surojit. While she is confident the situation is improving, she is not confident about the future. She has presented nine Budgets; which one do you see as a milestone?","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127875255,imgsize-1268392,width-400,resizemode-4/finance-minister-nirmala-sitharaman.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Passenger vehicle makers began 2026 on a strong note, with Jan sales data pointing to a broad-based momentum across the industry, aided by steady demand in smaller towns and cities, and sustained consumer sentiment after GST cuts.Market leader Maruti Suzuki posted passenger vehicle sales of 2.2 lakh units in Jan 2026, up from 2 lakh units a year ago, including exports that hit an all-time monthly high of around 51 thousand units.Partho Banerjee, senior executive officer at Maruti Suzuki, said recent Q3 results show a clear revival in the small-car segment after the GST cut. “I think the Q3 results, which we announced last week, show very good growth in the overall numbers…Of the incremental numbers of 98,000 in Q3, 72,000 units were in the 18% GST segment, and 26,000 units were in the 40% GST segment. Clearly, the 18% GST segment is seeing better growth as compared to the 40% segment. ”Hyundai Motor India reported its highest-ever sales, including exports, at 73,137 units in Jan, clocking 11.5% growth. Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles recorded total sales of about 71,066 units in Jan, including international shipments, compared to 48,316 units during same month last year.M&M sold 67,087 passenger vehicles in Jan, up 24% from a year ago period.Toyota Kirloskar Motor reported Jan sales of 33,880 units, up 15%, while Kia India sold about 27,603 units in Jan with a year-on-year growth of 10.3%.","Maruti Suzuki posted passenger vehicle sales of 2.2 lakh units in Jan 2026.

Joining hands for bigger impact

BENGALURU: Zensar Technologies is said to be close to acquiring Mastek in an $850–$900 million stock-and-cash deal. The move bolsters the ongoing trend of consolidation in the IT/ITeS services sector, driven partly by the dramatic changes ushered in by AI and global customers looking to reduce their number of vendors.The past year saw multiple acquisitions, including Capgemini’s takeover of WNS, Wipro’s acquisition of Harman’s digital transformation solutions business, Coforge’s acquisition of Encora, and TCS’s buyout of Salesforce consultancies ListEngage and Coastal Cloud. The negotiations between Pune-based Zensar and Mumbai-based Mastek are nearing the finish line, sources told TOI. The combined entity will be a stronger mid-market challenger, with an expanded AI and digital engineering portfolio, greater geographic reach, and a wider base of clients.If completed, the joint entity will have revenues exceeding $1.3 billion. When TOI contacted Zensar, the company said it does not comment on market rumours and speculation. A Mastek spokesperson said, “We would like to state that the information shared is speculative and incorrect. As a listed company, Mastek adheres to strict disclosure norms and regulatory requirements. Any material development—strategic, financial, or otherwise—is disclosed accordingly.The deal comes seven years after L&T’s unsolicited bid to acquire 66% in Mindtree for up to Rs 10,700 crore, highlighting renewed consolidation among technology services firms seeking scale and differentiated capabilities.Zensar, whose key clients include Cisco, the City of San Diego, and Tesco Insurance, derives nearly 68% of its business from the US and 21% from the UK/EU. The company reported revenue of roughly Rs 5,300 crore in FY25 and employs over 10,000 people. Mastek, which clocked Rs 3,455 crore in FY25, earns 57.3% of revenue from the UK and counts NHS, The Alternative Parcels Company, and Bank of England as key customers.It is positioning itself for the next growth phase by focusing on regional strongholds, particularly UK govt contracts, while rebuilding its US and AMEA operations. The UK–Europe market, contributing about 64% of revenue, is expected to deliver mid-teen growth, driven by rising digital healthcare investments.Healthcare emerged as Mastek’s fastest-growing vertical, backed by a strong track record in public-sector projects. The company is also expanding its Secured Govt Services presence and widening its footprint across departments such as the Home Office, HMRC, and the Ministry of Defence.","Zensar Technologies is said to be close to acquiring Mastek in an $850–$900 million stock-and-cash deal.

Budget 2026: 10 Changes In Income Tax Rules That Will Reshape How Indians Save And File Returns

MUMBAI: Government bond yields hardened on Monday, with the benchmark 10-year paper closing at a more than one-year high as a larger-than-expected borrowing programme weighed on demand ahead of the policy meeting, even as the rupee posted its best gains since Dec.The benchmark 10-year yield settled at around 6.77%, sharply higher than the previous session and its highest close since mid-Jan 2025. On Friday, it had ended near 6.7%, up from about 6.5% three months ago. Bond markets were shut on Sunday.The rupee rose about 47 paise to close at 91.51 to the dollar, marking its strongest single-day gain in over a month. The move followed likely dollar sales and modest inflows that helped offset global volatility. On Friday, the currency had touched an all-time intraday low of 91.99 before ending at 91.98.Yields are up nearly 18 basis points so far this year, driven by expectations of higher bond supply from the Centre and states.Concerns intensified after the Budget announced record gross market borrowing of Rs 17.2 lakh crore for 2026–27, nearly Rs 1 lakh crore above expectations.“Net market borrowing came in as expected (Rs 11.7 lakh crore) but gross market borrowing was higher (Rupees 17.2 ).It’s possible that the RBI switches or government buybacks reduce some of the pressure, but that is only a hope for now,” said Pranjul Bhandari, economist with HSBC. According to Bhandari, while the govt met its FY26 fiscal deficit target of 4.4% of GDP, it has opted for a gentler consolidation path of 4.3% for FY27, the smallest consolidation in six years.The Budget also pointed to a slower pace of fiscal consolidation, targeting a debt-to-GDP ratio of 55.6% and a fiscal deficit of 4.3% of GDP next year.In bond market, participants trimmed longer-duration exposure after the Budget and shifted to 1–3 year maturities, expecting liquidity support to cap short-end yields. Bond purchases in the secondary market and scheduled buying operations offered some relief, with markets awaiting further measures and expecting policy rates to remain unchanged.","The benchmark 10-year yield settled at around 6.77%, sharply higher than the previous session.

"India secures 18% tariff deal with US: Infosys, Wipro stocks surge in US market",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/india-secures-18-tariff-deal-with-us-infosys-wipro-stocks-surge-in-us-market/articleshow/127874229.cms,"NEW DELHI: US -listed shares of major Indian companies surged after US President Donald Trump announced a trade deal cutting US tariffs on Indian goods to 18% from 50%, in return for India agreeing to halt purchases of Russian oil and lower trade barriers.On Wall Street, IT services major Infosys closed 4.3% higher, Wipro jumped 6.8%, HDFC Bank gained 4.4%, and the iShares MSCI India exchange-traded fund rose 3%, reflecting investor optimism around improved trade access and reduced tariff pressure.Trump announced the agreement on Monday following a call with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, saying India would now buy oil from the United States and potentially Venezuela. A White House official told Reuters that the US would rescind a punitive 25% duty imposed on all imports from India over its purchases of Russian oil, which had been stacked on top of a 25% “reciprocal” tariff.PM Modi welcomed the move, saying, “Wonderful to speak with my dear friend President Trump today. Delighted that Made in India products will now have a reduced tariff of 18%. Big thanks to President Trump on behalf of the 1.4 billion people of India for this wonderful announcement.”Trump said India had committed to “BUY AMERICAN at a much higher level,” including more than $500 billion worth of US energy, technology, agricultural and other products. “They will likewise move forward to reduce their Tariffs and Non Tariff Barriers against the United States, to ZERO,” Trump said.Despite the market reaction, details of the deal remain limited. Trump’s social media post did not specify when the lower tariff rates would take effect, the timeline for India to end Russian oil purchases, or the scope of trade barrier reductions. As of late Monday, the White House had not issued a presidential proclamation or Federal Register notice required to formalise the changes.India’s commerce and foreign ministries did not immediately respond to requests for comment, while Russia’s embassy in Washington also did not respond. Previous US trade deals with Japan and South Korea included large investment commitments, but no such pledges were mentioned in the India announcement.Economists said the agreement brings India broadly in line with Asian peers on tariff rates. Madhavi Arora of Emkay Global said it would remove a disproportionate drag on India’s exports and its rupee, after Indian markets were hit hard by the tariff hikes and saw record foreign investor outflows in 2025.US business groups reacted cautiously. The US Chamber of Commerce called the announcement progress toward a broader market-opening deal. “We are optimistic that this is the first step toward a comprehensive trade agreement that will unlock even more private sector collaboration,” its CEO Suzanne Clark said.The deal also comes amid efforts by the Trump administration to finalise trade frameworks before a US Supreme Court ruling on the legality of Trump’s “reciprocal” tariffs. India, the world’s third-largest oil importer, has recently begun reducing Russian oil purchases, with imports projected to fall sharply in the coming months, according to Reuters.","US President Donald Trump announced a trade deal cutting US tariffs on Indian goods to 18% from 50%.

US plans $12 billion stockpile to cut China dependence; rare earth security becomes strategic priority,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-plans-12-billion-stockpile-to-cut-china-dependence-rare-earth-security-becomes-strategic-priority/articleshow/127865741.cms,"The United States is preparing to launch a $12 billion critical minerals stockpile initiative aimed at reducing dependence on China for rare earths and other strategic resources, according to a White House official, as Washington intensifies efforts to secure supply chains for key industries, AFP reported.The project is expected to combine about $1.7 billion in private capital with a $10 billion loan from the Export-Import Bank of the United States (EXIM), with funding directed towards securing and storing critical minerals for use by US industries including automotive, technology and defence sectors.The stockpile is designed to support private-sector demand by ensuring access to minerals vital for manufacturing products ranging from smartphones and electric vehicles to advanced military equipment.Rare-earth metals have gained strategic importance after China, a dominant global supplier, imposed export restrictions last year, heightening supply chain concerns across Western economies.China’s dominance across the rare earth value chain — spanning mining, processing and advanced materials innovation — is the result of sustained industrial policy over several decades, giving Beijing leverage in global trade negotiations.The proposed stockpile, expected to be announced by President Donald Trump, aims to gradually offset this advantage and stabilise access to critical materials for US manufacturers.According to reports, the initiative — dubbed “Project Vault” — could involve participation from more than a dozen companies, including automakers General Motors and Stellantis, aerospace major Boeing and technology firm Alphabet-owned Google.The programme is expected to cover rare earths, critical minerals and other strategic elements prone to supply disruptions and price volatility.The move comes amid renewed trade tensions between the United States and China following the reintroduction of tariffs after Trump returned to the presidency last year.The US and its allies are increasingly investing in alternative mining and processing supply chains to reduce strategic dependence on China, though industry experts caution that building fully diversified supply networks could take several years.The EXIM Bank is expected to vote on authorising the proposed 15-year loan for the project, which could become one of the largest financing deals of its kind, according to reports.","The project is expected to combine about $1.7 billion in private capital with a $10 billion loan from the Export-Import Bank of the United States.

Wall Street opened on a subdued note Monday as big technology stocks weighed on US indices, even as gold and silver prices clawed back part of their recent losses, according to AP.The S&P 500 slipped 0.2%, putting it on track for a fourth straight modest decline. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 173 points, while the Nasdaq Composite also dropped 0.2% in early trade. Nvidia and other large technology stocks pressured the market, as their chips remain central to global artificial intelligence expansion.The moves followed global volatility overnight. US futures had earlier weakened, with S&P 500 futures down 0.7%, Dow futures off 0.4%, and Nasdaq futures falling 0.7%, amid uncertainty over President Donald Trump’s nominee for the next Federal Reserve chair and renewed concerns about a potential AI market bubble.Precious metals recovered part of last week’s sharp losses. Gold rose 1.3% to about $4,800 per ounce, while silver jumped 5.9% to $83.19, though both remained below recent highs after Friday’s sharp correction.Bitcoin stabilised after a steep fall, rising about 1.5% to just above $78,000, though crypto-linked stocks remained under pressure. Coinbase fell 3.7% in early trade, while bitcoin holder Strategy, formerly MicroStrategy, dropped 7.6%.Oil prices were sharply lower after tumbling more than 5% overnight. US benchmark crude fell $3.19, or 4.9%, to $62.02 per barrel, while Brent crude declined $3.16 to $66.16 per barrel. Natural gas prices dropped 17% after recent weather-driven gains.Investors are also tracking a heavy week of corporate earnings and US labour market data, including the January jobs report due later in the week.Shares of Walt Disney Co edged up less than 1% after the company reported strong first-quarter results, supported by box-office performances of “Zootopia 2” and “Avatar: Fire and Ash.” Disney Entertainment revenue rose 7%, while Experiences division revenue grew 6%.Markets are also assessing the potential policy stance of Kevin Warsh, Trump’s nominee for Federal Reserve chair, whose nomination requires Senate approval. Concerns that the Fed’s independence could be tested have helped support gold prices and weaken the US dollar over the past year.In global markets, Asian indices saw sharper declines earlier in the session. South Korea’s Kospi closed 5.3% lower at 4,949.67, with Samsung Electronics falling 6.3% and SK Hynix dropping 8.7%. Japan’s Nikkei 225 fell 1.3%, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng dropped 2.2%, and China’s Shanghai Composite declined 2.5%. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 fell 1%, while Taiwan’s Taiex slipped 1.4%.European markets traded higher midday, with Germany’s DAX up 0.8%, France’s CAC 40 rising 0.6%, and the UK’s FTSE 100 gaining 0.7%.Separately, geopolitical tensions remained in focus after Trump said Iran should negotiate a “satisfactory” deal to prevent it from obtaining nuclear weapons, adding that talks were ongoing. The comments helped ease concerns about potential oil supply disruptions, analysts said.","The S&P 500 slipped 0.2%, putting it on track for a fourth straight modest decline.

Bitcoin edged higher in early Asian trading after falling below $76,000 during thin weekend trading, returning to levels last seen in the aftermath of Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariffs last year.The broad market moves reflected muted sentiment ahead of a heavy week for global markets, which includes interest-rate decisions from central banks in Europe and the UK, the release of US employment data, and a large number of corporate earnings announcements.On Friday, investors globally had already repositioned to scale back expectations of policy easing under a Federal Reserve led by Warsh.Strength in the dollar last week was driven not only by turmoil in gold and silver, but also by reassessments of the Federal Reserve’s future policy direction. Warsh, if confirmed by the Senate, will take over from Jerome Powell when his term ends in May. In energy markets, OPEC+ confirmed it would keep oil output unchanged in March, completing the final stage of a three-month supply freeze, despite crude prices touching a four-month high amid expectations of a possible US strike against Iran.Meanwhile, in the US, the federal government entered a partial shutdown on Saturday as lawmakers awaited House approval of a funding agreement reached by Trump with Democrats, following nationwide outrage over the killing of a US citizen in Minneapolis by Border Patrol agents.","Hong Kong's HSI was down 554 points or 2% to 26,832.

US President Donald Trump has claimed that his sweeping tariff policies have created an “American economic miracle”, dismissing warnings of global fallout and asserting that critics of his trade strategy “were all wrong”.In an opinion piece published in The Wall Street Journal, Trump said the tariffs he imposed on nearly all foreign countries last April had strengthened the US economy rather than triggering the global economic meltdown predicted by skeptics.“When I imposed historic tariffs on nearly all foreign countries last April, the critics said my policies would cause a global economic meltdown,” Trump wrote, as quoted news agency ANI. “Instead, they have created an American economic miracle, and we are quickly building the greatest economy in the history of the world, with other countries doing just fine!”The US president said he inherited a “ravaged economy” from his predecessor and was accused of pushing the world towards recession, but claimed those forecasts had been disproved. “Nine months later, the results are in, every one of those predictions has proven completely and totally wrong,” he wrote, adding that since his election in 2024 the US had seen 52 stock market highs.Trump asserted that the American economy was growing at 4.4 per cent with inflation at 1.4 per cent, and that real incomes for US workers had risen by between $1,000 and $2,000. He also claimed the stock market had “skyrocketed” since what he described as “Liberation Day”, saying the Dow Jones Industrial Average could soon breach the 50,000 mark.In the op-ed, Trump further claimed his administration had cut the federal budget deficit by 27 per cent in a single year and slashed the monthly trade deficit by 77 per cent, “all with virtually no inflation”.He also cited trade agreements with China, the UK, the European Union, Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, Indonesia, the Philippines and Malaysia, saying these deals had blunted retaliation against the US and strengthened economic security.Trump went on to make broader claims about the geopolitical impact of tariffs, arguing that they had bolstered US national security and even contributed to peace-making efforts. He asserted—without evidence—that tariffs had helped resolve several conflicts, including what he described as mediation between India and Pakistan.Concluding his article, Trump urged critics to acknowledge his record. “Just over one year ago, we were a ‘DEAD’ country. Now, we are the ‘HOTTEST’ country anywhere in the world,” he wrote, adding that skeptics should don his “favourite red hats” bearing the slogan: “TRUMP WAS RIGHT ABOUT EVERYTHING!",US President Donald Trump has claimed that his sweeping tariff policies have created an “American economic miracle” He dismissed warnings of global fallout and asserted that critics of his trade strategy “were all wrong” Trump said the tariffs he imposed on nearly all foreign countries last April had strengthened the US economy rather than triggering global economic meltdown.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127824776,imgsize-747985,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"
US government enters partial shutdown after Congress fails to pass 2026 budget,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-government-enters-partial-shutdown-after-congress-fails-to-pass-2026-budget/articleshow/127814414.cms,"Schumer DARES Trump On ICE After Rare Deal Stripping DHS Funding To Halt Shutdown: ‘No Vote Unless…’

The US government entered a partial shutdown Saturday after Congress failed to approve the 2026 budget by midnight. The shutdown was triggered by Democratic opposition to federal immigration agents killing two protesters in Minneapolis, which halted talks about Department of Homeland Security funding. However, the disruption is expected to be brief as the House plans to approve a Senate-backed deal early next week.The Senate also passed a funding package Friday that covers many federal agencies through September. It also includes a temporary two-week extension for DHS operations while lawmakers work out immigration enforcement details. However, about 75% of federal operations are impacted by the shutdown, affecting various sectors like education, health, housing, and defense.Senate Democratic Minority Whip Dick Durbin criticised the administration's priorities, saying, ""Instead of going after drug smugglers, child predators, and human traffickers, the Trump Administration is wasting valuable resources targeting peaceful protestors in Chicago and Minneapolis."" He added, ""This Administration continues to make Americans less safe.""Federal departments started implementing shutdown procedures overnight.If the shutdown continues beyond a few days, many federal workers could face unpaid leave or work without pay until funding resumes. However, both Republican and Democratic leaders believe the disruption will be short-lived once the House approves the Senate's package.President Trump has endorsed the Senate's agreement and is pushing for quick House action. He aims to avoid a lengthy shutdown like the record-breaking hit last fall that disrupted federal services for over a month. The House, currently out of session until Monday, is expected to vote on the package when they return.While federal agencies began shutdown preparations, the impact on government services, contractors, and federal workers should be minimal if the House passes the funding package as anticipated early next week. This would restore funding within days, limiting the shutdown's practical effects.","The US government entered a partial shutdown Saturday after Congress failed to approve the 2026 budget by midnight.

Who is Kevin Warsh?

NEW DELHI: US president Donald Trump on Friday announced Kevin Warsh as his nominee for chairman of the US Federal Reserve, setting the stage for a contentious Senate confirmation process amid growing debate over the central bank’s independence.In a post on Truth Social, Trump said, "" I am pleased to announce that I am nominating Kevin Warsh to be the CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM. Kevin currently serves as the Shepard Family Distinguished Visiting Fellow in Economics at the Hoover Institution, and Lecturer at the Stanford Graduate School of Business. He is a Partner of Stanley Druckenmiller at Duquesne Family Office LLC. Kevin received his A.B. from Stanford University, and J.D. from Harvard Law School. He has conducted extensive research in the field of Economics and Finance. Kevin issued an Independent Report to the Bank of England proposing reforms in the conduct of Monetary Policy in the United Kingdom. Parliament adopted the Report's recommendations. Kevin Warsh became the youngest Fed Governor, ever, at 35, and served as a Member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System from 2006 until 2011, as the Federal Reserve's Representative to the Group of Twenty (G-20), and as the Board's Emissary to the Emerging and Advanced Economies in Asia. In addition, he was Administrative Governor, managing and overseeing the Board's operations, personnel, and financial performance. Prior to his appointment to the Board, from 2002 until 2006, Kevin served as Special Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, and Executive Secretary of the White House National Economic Council. Previously, Kevin was a member of the Mergers & Acquisitions Department at Morgan Stanley & Co., in New York, serving as Vice President and Executive Director. I have known Kevin for a long period of time, and have no doubt that he will go down as one of the GREAT Fed Chairmen, maybe the best. On top of everything else, he is “central casting,” and he will never let you down. Congratulations Kevin!""Warsh previously served as a member of the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors from 2006 to 2011 and was the youngest Fed governor at the time of his appointment. He worked closely with then Fed chair Ben Bernanke during the 2008 global financial crisis and emerged as a key link between policymakers and financial markets.Before joining the Fed, Warsh served in the White House as special assistant to the president for economic policy and executive secretary of the National Economic Council under president George W Bush. He began his career in investment banking at Morgan Stanley, where he worked in the mergers and acquisitions division.The nomination comes days after the Federal Reserve held interest rates steady under current chair Jerome Powell, whom Trump again criticised, calling him a ""moron"". Trump had said he would announce his pick after the rate decision, as months of attacks on Powell have raised concerns among investors about political pressure on the central bank. US media reports said Warsh emerged ahead of other contenders, including Fed Governor Christopher Waller, BlackRock executive Rick Rieder and Trump’s economic adviser Kevin Hassett.In recent years, Warsh has criticised the Fed for moving into political territory and argued that its policy choices have constrained economic growth. He has publicly supported interest rate cuts to boost the economy, even as Fed officials have cautioned about inflation risks, including those stemming from Trump’s tariff policies.Warsh’s appointment will require confirmation by the US Senate. The Senate Banking Committee will first review the nomination, followed by a full Senate vote.

Space-based data centers and AI strategy

SpaceX IPO could be largest in history

SpaceX is exploring potential mergers with Tesla Inc or artificial intelligence startup xAI, as Elon Musk considers ways to consolidate his growing business empire.The aerospace company has held internal talks about the feasibility of a SpaceX–Tesla merger, an idea that some investors are actively encouraging, reported Bloomberg, citing sources. Separately, SpaceX is also evaluating a possible combination with xAI ahead of a potential initial public offering.No final decisions have been made, and the details of any transaction could still change.Any merger involving SpaceX could draw strong interest from infrastructure funds and Middle Eastern sovereign wealth funds, according to people familiar with the matter. One source noted that a deal could also require a significant financing component.Different merger structures could support Musk’s broader vision for SpaceX, including placing data centers in orbit to handle advanced artificial intelligence computing.A merger between SpaceX and xAI could allow the AI company to leverage space-based computing capacity, if the technical challenges can be overcome. SpaceX has discussed the possibility of using satellites and orbital infrastructure to support large-scale AI workloads.Tesla could also play a role in this strategy. The electric vehicle maker’s energy storage systems may help power space-based data centers using solar energy. Musk has additionally discussed using SpaceX’s Starship rockets to transport Tesla’s Optimus humanoid robots to the Moon and Mars.Following reports of the potential merger discussions, Tesla shares rose as much as 4.5% in after-hours trading on Thursday. The stock had declined 3.5% during regular trading, leaving Tesla with a market capitalization of approximately $1.56 trillion.Bloomberg News has previously reported that SpaceX is targeting an IPO valuation of around $1.5 trillion, potentially placing it among the most valuable companies in the world.According to Nevada business records, two legal entities containing the phrase “merger sub” were formed on January 21. Both entities list SpaceX Chief Financial Officer Bret Johnsen as an officer, a move often associated with merger preparations.Reuters previously reported on a potential SpaceX–xAI merger, under which xAI shares would be exchanged for SpaceX stock. Some xAI executives may be offered cash in lieu of equity, according to people familiar with the proposal.SpaceX is considering a public listing as early as June, around Elon Musk’s birthday, and could seek to raise up to $50 billion, sources have said. If completed, the offering would be the largest IPO in history.Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, and Morgan Stanley are expected to serve as lead underwriters. Robinhood Markets is also seeking a role in the IPO, Bloomberg News reported.In December, CFO Bret Johnsen told employees that a SpaceX IPO would help fund an “insane flight rate” for the company’s Starship rocket and support plans for a permanent Moon base.","The aerospace company has held internal talks about the feasibility of a SpaceX–Tesla merger.

Asian markets are mostly down on Friday as concerns about AI investments grow. Tech stocks took a hit, while gold and silver prices dropped from their record highs. Oil prices also fell as tensions between the US and Iran showed signs of easing. The market's ups and downs this week were influenced by various factors, including a weaker dollar and Donald Trump's threats against Iran.The tech sector's earlier optimism about AI, boosted by strong earnings from Meta, Samsung, and SK hynix, took a downturn after Microsoft's announcement. The company revealed plans to increase AI infrastructure spending, which worried investors about delayed returns on investment. This news had a significant impact on Microsoft's stock.""Microsoft suffered its worst session since the Covid‑era crash, falling 12 percent and accounting for over two‑thirds of the S&P 500's decline,"" said National Australia Bank's Rodrigo Catril, as quoted by AFP. He pointed out that investors were worried about rising costs and slower growth in cloud services.Most Asian markets struggled, with Hong Kong and Shanghai dropping more than 1%.Tokyo, Sydney, Singapore, Taipei, and Manila also fell, while Seoul and Wellington saw some gains. Jakarta continued to face challenges after MSCI raised concerns about ownership issues.Indian markets also opened at a low. While Nifty50 went below 25,300, BSE Sensex was down over 500 points.

The slight increase in the dollar value contributed to this decline, despite Trump's apparent comfort with a weaker US currency.Oil markets remained volatile, with prices falling more than 1% after Thursday's 5% surge. This came as Trump warned Iran about possible strikes while sending military forces to the region. However, fears persist about potential conflicts in the oil-rich area, which could drive up prices and inflation.The overall market sentiment reflects caution about tech valuations and concerns about possible market bubbles, as stocks have reached record highs in recent years largely due to tech sector growth.","Asian markets are mostly down on Friday as concerns about AI investments grow.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Space sector start-up Sisir Radar to develop SAR on L/P band SAR,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/space-sector-start-up-sisir-radar-to-develop-sar-on-l/p-band-sar/articleshow/104558111.cms,"CHENNAI: Space sector startup, Sisir Radar Private Ltd has hit success at the prestigious iDEX DefSpace Challenge with its projects for development of “L/P band Continuous Wave SAR (synthetic aperture radar) payload for LEO Small Satellites” and “Unfurlable, Electronically Steering Antenna for L/P band SAR payload” for Indian Air Force (IAF), said a top company official.The company is promoted by former Director at the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) Tapan Misra and the brains behind the Indian space agency’s RISAT series of SAR satellites as well as the Dual Frequency SAR on the Chandrayaan 2 orbiter that is currently circling the moon.""A grant of Rs 3 crore is also there for development of the products,"" Misra told IANS.Synthetic Aperture Radar or SAR is a special kind of imaging radar technology that can provide extremely accurate high resolution imagery of the terrain through clouds, smoke and dust even in pitch dark conditions. SAR imagery provides much higher resolution than other forms of remote sensing technology such as hyperspectral and multispectral. SAR is a critical technology for strategic reconnaissance and planning as well as for disaster management.According to Misra, winning the challenge in just over a year of floating the company is a major booster.He said L and P band SAR have an advantage over other frequencies (like X band) when it comes to penetration capabilities through rain, clouds, foliage and vegetation in a tropical country like India, and underground penetration capabilities in dry terrain.Continuing further, he said the L band SAR will provide 1 metre resolution, spotlight resolution in Stripmap mode. The current industry standard is 5-10 metre in L band. Misra said both the L and P band will operate simultaneously from a satellite borne SAR. Recently, Sisir Radar successfully developed and tested the world’s highest resolution L-Band SAR fitted on a drone. With 0.2 metre resolution, this is by far the highest L band SAR in the world, he said.","Space sector startup, Sisir Radar Private Ltd has hit success at the prestigious iDEX DefSpace Challenge. The company is promoted by former Director at the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) Tapan Misra and the brains behind the Indian space agency’s RISAT series of SAR satellites.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-104558088,imgsize-2534,width-400,resizemode-4/SISIRRADAR.jpg"

Explainer: What is 'Hindu rate of growth' and why Raghuram Rajan's remarks may be 'premature',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/explainer-what-is-hindu-rate-of-growth-and-why-raghuram-rajans-remarks-may-be-premature/articleshow/98482598.cms,"What is meant by Hindu growth rate

How India's GDP has been growing

What SBI report said on savings and investment

Incremental capital output ratio

NEW DELHI: India's gross domestic product (GDP) data for the third quarter (October-December 2022) received a word of caution from the former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan In an interview with news agency PTI, Rajan that India is ""dangerously close"" to the Hindu rate of growth in view of subdued private sector investment, high interest rates and slowing global growth.India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying"".However, a report released by the State Bank of India (SBI) economists on Tuesday dismissed arguments that India is dangerously close to Hindu rate of growth saying such statements are ""ill-conceived, biased and premature"".The term 'Hindu growth rate' was coined by late economist Raj Krishna in 1978 to describe the slow growth in the country.It basically refers to the low pace of economic growth rates during 1950s to 1980s. During this period, the Indian economy averaged 3.5%.A former lecturer at the Delhi School of Economics (DSE), Krishna noted that only if the rate of growth is persistently slow and accompanied by low per-capita GDP, then it will be known as Hindu rate of growth but it has to factor in population growth as well.Before economic reforms of 1991, India's economic growth remained stagnant and low, while per capita income averaged around 1.3%.Krishna termed this low growth situation to be a result of socialist policies of state control and import substitution.However, the economic situation changed when liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation (LPG) reforms came into effect in the year 1991, at a time when India faced balance of payment crisis.Over the years, many economists have strongly opposed the idea of 'Hindu growth rate' and the term never had universal acceptance.The Indian economy plunged into its very first technical recession in FY21 due to the impact of Covid-19 pandemic and the related nationwide lockdowns. GDP shrunk by an unprecedented 23.8% in the first quarter of the financial year 2020-21. However, due to spurt in economic activities in the subsequent quarters, the GDP decline started to narrow.However, if we look at the period before Covid-19 as well, India's growth curve shows a declining trend.From 8.26% in FY17, GDP growth plunged to 3.74% in FY20. Shutdown of economic activities in FY21 in wake of Covid-19 only made matters worse.As lockdowns started to ease and business activities resumed, India's GDP also started rising. In Q1 of FY22, growth jumped to 20.1% mainly on account of low base effect. By the fourth quarter of FY22, growth came down to 4.10%.Similarly, the new financial year 2022-23 brought fresh economic challenges in the form of Russia-Ukraine war that impacted almost all major economies of the world, slowed the pace of growth, pushed inflation to record highs.As a result, the central banks of all advanced economies spurred into action and opted for monetary policy tightening to curb the soaring inflation.With persistently rising interest rates, India's economy grew by 4.4% in Q3 of FY23, as the Centre revised upwards GDP growth for previous year to 9.10% from 8.7% earlier.The report weighed recent GDP numbers against the available data on savings and investments for the past decade and highlighted some interesting points.""Quarterly growth numbers are noisy and should be best avoided for any serious interpretation (on an average, India's GDP growth has witnessed Rs 2 lakh crore upward revision for the 3 year ended FY23),"" the report said.Gross capital formation (GCF) by the government touched a high of 11.8% in 2021-22, up from 10.7% in 2020-21.""This also had a domino effect on private sector investment that jumped from 10 per cent to 10.8% over the same period,"" it said.In fact, Ecowrap added that the trends in GCF to gross output ratio or the plough back of funds for creation of fresh capacity shows that for public administration the ratio attained fresh peak in 2021-22 owing to the emphasis on capital expenditure in recent budgets.At the aggregate level, gross capital formation is supposed to have crossed 32% in 2022-23, the highest level since 2018-19.According to the report, in 2021-22, gross savings have risen to 30% from 29% in 2020-21.""The ratio is supposed to have crossed 31 per cent in 2022-23, the highest since 2018-19. The household savings increased sharply during the pandemic period on account of sharp accretion in financial savings such as deposits,"" said the report by SBI's Economic Research Department.While household financial savings have since then moderated from 15.4% in 2020-21 to 11.1% in 2022-23, savings in physical assets have grown sharply to 11.8% in 2021-22 from 10.7% in 2020-21.The report further analysed Incremental Capital Output ratio (ICOR) -- which measures additional units of capital (investment) needed to produce additional units of output. It said that the ratio has been improving.""ICOR which was 7.5 in FY 12 is now only 3.5 in FY22. Clearly, only half of capital is now needed for next unit of output,"" the report noted.Such reducing ICOR in the current years reflects a relatively increasing efficiency of capital and shows that the economy is on a sound footing, the report said.""From that point of view, future GDP growth rates even at 7% could still mean a decent number by any standards!,"" it added.","India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.

An employee is entitled for a 50 per cent amount of the last drawn salary as pension.OPS was discontinued by the NDA government in 2003 with effect from April 1, 2004.Under the new pension scheme (NPS), employees contribute 10 per cent of their basic salary towards pension while the government contributes 14 per cent.Governments of Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand have informed the central government/ Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA about their decision to restart OPS for their employees.The government of Punjab on November 18, 2022, issued a notification regarding implementation of OPS for the state government employees who are being covered under NPS. Jharkhand too has decided to revert to OPS.",Former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan has expressed his concern over the decision of some states to restart the old pension scheme.

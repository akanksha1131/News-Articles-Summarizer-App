What are the new bank nomination rules? Top points

According to the revised provisions, account holders can nominate up to four individuals, either simultaneous or in succession - a step that will facilitate a straightforward claim settlement process for both depositors and nominees.

Account holders have the choice to select either simultaneous or successive nominations based on their requirements.

Up to four nominees can be designated by depositors, with specific allocation of shares or percentages for each, totalling 100 per cent, which ensures clear distribution amongst all nominees.

For deposits, articles in safe custody, or lockers, individuals can specify up to four nominees. The subsequent nominee becomes active only after the death of the higher-placed nominee, ensuring seamless settlement and succession clarity.

For items kept in safe custody and safety deposit lockers, the regulations permit only successive nominations.

Stock market recommendations:The benchmark index Nifty has delivered a strong performance through October, advancing over 1500 points from its low of 24588 in just 15 trading sessions. This sharp upward move was driven by festive optimism, steady domestic inflows, and supportive global cues, reflecting a robust bullish sentiment.During the Diwali week, the index approached its all-time high, raising expectations of a breakout. However, it failed to sustain the momentum and encountered profit booking, indicating a shift in investor sentiment following the rapid rise.This slowdown has led to the emergence of a Shooting Star-like candlestick pattern on the weekly chart, which typically signals a potential reversal or exhaustion in the prevailing trend. The pattern suggests that while buyers attempted to push prices higher, they faced resistance. A confirmation candle, usually a bearish follow-through, will be essential to validate this reversal signal.From a momentum perspective, the daily RSI had reached a high of 72.69, indicating overbought conditions. It has since declined to 67.19 and is currently trending lower, reinforcing the cautious outlook.At the same time, market participants are closely monitoring developments around the India-US trade deal, which could serve as a key trigger for the next directional move.A favourable outcome may revive bullish sentiment and fuel further upside.In terms of technical levels, the 25550–25500 zone is expected to act as a strong support, as it coincides with the 13-day EMA and the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement of the recent rally from 24588 to 26104. On the upside, the 25950–26000 zone remains a critical resistance. A sustained move above 26000 could pave the way for a rally towards 26300.With technical indicators cooling off and macro factors in play, the coming sessions will be crucial in determining whether this is a temporary pause or the beginning of a broader correction.The banking index Bank Nifty registered a new all-time high on Thursday, reflecting strong sectoral momentum and investor confidence. However, the index was unable to hold above the critical 58500 mark, and soon after, it experienced profit booking, indicating a temporary shift in sentiment following the sharp rally.This pullback has resulted in the formation of a Shooting Star candlestick pattern on the weekly chart, a technical signal that often points to trend exhaustion. The pattern suggests that while buyers attempted to push prices higher, they encountered resistance, leading to a potential pause or reversal in the ongoing uptrend.Adding to the cautious outlook, the daily RSI has also weakened. After reaching a high of 76, the RSI has now given a bearish crossover and is trending lower, typically indicating a cooling-off in momentum and the possibility of a consolidation phase.With Bank Nifty at a crucial juncture, market participants will be closely watching for confirmation signals in the coming sessions. Whether this is a brief pause or the beginning of a broader correction will depend on price action over the next few trading days.From a technical standpoint, the 57000–56900 zone is expected to act as key support, as it aligns with the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level of the recent rally. On the upside, the 58200–58300 zone remains a critical resistance area. A sustained move above 58300 could pave the way for a sharp rally towards 59000, and potentially 59500, in the short term.CUMMINSIND had been consolidating in a 3830–4030 range since early October, forming a series of small-bodied candles that indicated indecision among traders. The stock broke out of this range on Thursday, and the move was followed by strong follow-through buying in Friday’s session, confirming bullish momentum. With Friday’s close, Cummins India has moved above the upper band of the Bollinger Bands, reflecting heightened buying strength.Moreover, the MACD has given a bullish crossover above its signal line, accompanied by rising histogram bars, which indicates increasing positive momentum and suggests the potential for further upside in the near term. Hence, we recommend to accumulate the stock in the zone of 4190-4170 with a stoploss of 4050. On the upside, it is likely to test the level of 4500 in the short term.BLUESTARCO recently broke out of a downward sloping trendline, signalling a shift in momentum in favour of the bulls. After the breakout, the stock consolidated within a tight 1940–1990 range for four trading sessions, digesting gains before resuming its upward move. On Friday, it broke above this range with strong follow-through buying backed by healthy volumes, reaffirming bullish sentiment.The stock also trades above all key moving averages, indicating strength in the broader trend. Meanwhile, the RSI, which had flattened in the last few sessions, has started turning higher, and the ADX is rising, suggesting that momentum is building up for a further upside move. Hence, we recommend to accumulate the stock in the zone of 2020-2000 with a stoploss of 1940. On the upside, it is likely to test the level of 2160 in the short term.","According to Sudeep Shah, Head - Technical Research and Derivatives, SBI Securities, the top stock picks for this week are Cummins India, and Blue Star.

"Reliance, PSU refineries look to suspend Russian oil imports on US curbs",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/reliance-psu-refineries-look-to-suspend-russian-oil-imports-on-us-curbs/articleshow/124767849.cms,"Representational AI image

""They are going to stop..."" Trump Reiterates Claim That India Is Cutting Down Russian Oil Imports





NEW DELHI: Reliance Industries and state-run refiners are looking at suspending Russian crude imports after the US on Wednesday sanctioned Rosneft and Lukoil, the largest exporters of those barrels.Reliance, the single-largest Indian consumer of Russian oil, will be the biggest loser as it buys most of those barrels directly from Rosneft under a term contract. Russian crude makes up about half of the feed at the company's 35-million-tonne complex.“Recalibration of Russian oil imports is ongoing and Reliance will be fully aligned to GOI (Government of India) guidelines,” a Reliance spokesman told Reuters.The curbs on Rosneft will also make life harder for Nayara Energy, which is half owned by the Russian giant and struggling to stay afloat since September when the EU imposed sanctions. Analysts said selling products from its 20-million-tonne refinery at Gujarat's Vadinar will be tough.Importers can receive contracted shipments till November 21. Unlike previous sanctions, when Russian oil could be traded within the $60 price cap, this time the curbs are directed at the companies, making their barrel tainted after the cut-off date.So far this year, 36% of India’s crude has been from Russia, with Rosneft and Lukoil supplying nearly 60% of this.A senior executive of IndianOil, one of the largest consumers of Russian oil among state-run refiners, said those barrels make up 15-18% of their crude basket.“It is too early. We are looking at the fine print. But it will not be too difficult to arrange alternative supplies from West Asia or other geographies such as Africa, the US etc. But others will also be crowding those markets, which will jack up benchmark prices and premia on other crude. This will impact margins. But Russian oil somehow finds its way into the market as we have seen in the past… but banking issues may crop up,” he said.Sure enough, benchmark Brent crude price shot up 5%, or by $2.9 a barrel, to 65.50 on Thursday. ""The good thing is prices are in their 60s. Even if they rise to $70, it will be manageable.""US President Donald Trump has been mounting pressure on countries such as India and China to lower oil imports from Russia as part of a plan to squeeze Moscow to come to the negotiating table on the Ukraine conflict. Trump imposed secondary tariffs of 25% on India, in addition to 25% reciprocal tariffs, citing Russian crude purchases.Late Thursday, Russian President Vladimir Putin hit back at the US. “This is, of course, an attempt to put pressure on Russia. But no self-respecting country and no self-respecting people ever decides anything under pressure.” He said breaking the balance in the global energy markets could lead to a hike in prices that would be uncomfortable for countries such as the US.As a country, the loss of discounted Russian oil could potentially cost India, which meets 85% of its crude requirement through imports, an estimated annual savings of about $4-5 billion on its oil import bill. Ratings agency ICRA estimates that replacement supplies at market prices would increase the oil import bill by 2%, potentially impacting the macroeconomic parameters.Sumit Ritolia, analyst at global real-time data and analytics provider Kpler, said the term arrangement with Rosneft could “introduce some near-term friction, especially from a compliance standpoint for RIL. The company would understandably wish to avoid any exposure to OFAC (US Office of Foreign Assets Control) and it will need to look at its Russian crude strategy.”The immediate operational impact on state-run refiners, he said, ""should remain limited"" as they buy Russian crude through tender from third-party traders. “However, secondary sanctions related to logistics and financing could pose indirect challenges.”","Reliance Industries and state-run refiners are looking at suspending Russian crude imports.

The price structure indicates consolidation within a narrow range as market participants await fresh triggers.The 8 EMA has flattened and is converging towards the 21 EMA, hinting at a loss of short-term momentum, while prices are currently holding marginally above the previous day’s pivot zone near ₹1,23,400 — acting as a key intraday support.RSI has slipped to around 39, reflecting weakening momentum and suggesting that the bulls are losing grip after recent gains.

'Egregious behavior': Trump says he's ending trade talks with Canada over TV ads,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/egregious-behavior-trump-says-hes-ending-trade-talks-with-canada-over-tv-ads-all-you-need-to-know/articleshow/124776027.cms,"Donald Trump, Mark Carney (AP)

'TERMINATED': Huge Escalation Between Canada & U.S; Trump Retaliates After Carney Junks America





US President Donald Trump on Thursday announced that he is halting all trade negotiations with Canada, citing television advertisements he said were intended to influence American court decisions.President Trump described the ads as “egregious behavior” and accused Canada of misusing footage of former President Ronald Reagan . “The Ronald Reagan Foundation has just announced that Canada has fraudulently used an advertisement, which is FAKE, featuring Ronald Reagan speaking negatively about Tariffs,” he said in a post on Truth Social.“Based on their egregious behavior, ALL TRADE NEGOTIATIONS WITH CANADA ARE HEREBY TERMINATED,” Trump added.Earlier this week, Trump said he had seen the ad on television and interpreted it as evidence that his tariffs were making an impact.The move follows remarks from Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, who said he plans to double Canada’s exports to markets outside the US in response to the threat posed by Trump’s tariffs.The advertisement, launched by Ontario Premier Doug Ford’s government for $75 million highlights former President Ronald Reagan’s warning about the harm of tariffs.The 60-second TV spot features workers, such as welders and bakers, as well as families, while using Reagan’s 1987 radio address, in which he stated that trade barriers hurt all American workers and consumers, as cited by the Globe and Mail.“High tariffs inevitably lead to retaliation by foreign countries and the triggering of fierce trade wars,” Reagan says.“Then the worst happens. Markets shrink and collapse, businesses and industries shut down, and millions of people lose their jobs. Throughout the world, there’s a growing realization that the way to prosperity for all nations is rejecting protectionist legislation and promoting fair and free competition,” Reagan says in the advertisement.Ford revealed the $ 75 million price tag for the ads during a speech earlier this month at the Empire Club of Canada luncheon in downtown Toronto. He added that the province plans to deliver the message “to every Republican district” across the United States.“We’re just going to speak the truth,” Ford said. “That ad, it’s not a nasty ad. It’s actually just very factual. Coming from a person like Ronald Reagan, every Republican is going to identify that voice.”The Ronald Reagan Foundation dismissed the ad as a ""misrepresentation"" and said it is reviewing legal options to challenge its use.“The ad misrepresents the Presidential Radio Address, and the Government of Ontario did not seek nor receive permission to use and edit the remarks. The Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute is reviewing its legal option in this matter,” the Foundation said through a post on X.","US President Donald Trump announced that he is halting all trade negotiations with Canada.

MUMBAI: It has been busy couple of months for global brands in India. Italian fashion retailer OVS made its debut in the country earlier in Oct, other global chiefs toured the region to introduce new launches and take stock of the market that has been growing even as prospects of global growth remain clouded with tariff-related uncertainty.For many brands, the slowdown in the US and China have been a major drag on growth. India's young population is a big pull for most lifestyle brands as the cohort is key to driving consumption, influencing household purchases and shaping brand narratives. For most companies, the market is also among the fastest-growing backed by higher disposable incomes and a new crop of rich who can afford to spend big.""Europe is an important area for us but it is on an average, an older part of the world. We cater to millennials and the perfect platform to do that is India. We are looking at India with a special eye as it is also the future of the brand,"" said Barbara De Rigo, owner at Italy's De Rigo Group which operates its eyewear and watch brand Police in India through retail partnership with players such as Titan.In an interaction with TOI here last month, she said that the US and China, among the firm's biggest markets are 'suffering,' after tariffs.""India is outstanding given the worldwide situation,"" De Rigo said, hinting that the company is looking at the possibility of manufacturing locally.Even as the US consumer spending data for Aug has been better than expected, economists estimate spending to slow considerably by the end of the year due to high prices, international media reported.Be it an accessible luxury brand, a premium one such as Police or a mass player such as OVS that offers an average selling price of about Rs 2,200, companies are leveraging the scale and diversity of the Indian market to expand.In the last couple of years or so, there has been an influx of different tiers of global brands in India. Stephane Waser, MD at Swiss watch brand Maurice Lacroix said that consumer appetite for accessible luxury watches in India has been on the rise and very few global markets today are showing a similar traction.""We have seen an evolution of India which is incredible,"" said Waser, pointing to an expanding infrastructure and increasing spending power. For the brand which forayed into the local market in 2019, India is already among its top ten markets globally and the ""ambition is to get in top five in 2-3 years,"" said Waser. The brand has hit a ""sweet spot"" in terms of pricing in the region (starts at 1000-1300 Swiss Francs or a little over Rs 1 lakh) and widening its reach in India shouldn't be a challenge, Waser added.New entrant OVS typically operates in international markets through franchise partnerships but in India, it has entered directly given the country's high growth potential. ""India is a very strategic country. We have built a local team here,"" said global chief retail officer Carmine Di Virgilio.","India's young population is a big pull for most lifestyle brands.

Better Representation Likely For Unorganised Sector Too





NEW DELHI: The new GDP series, which is due to be released early next year, is expected to have more elaborate data on services, including the digital economy , as well as unincorporated enterprises.Since the last series, there has been a surge in the digital economy with e-commerce coming up in a big way along with aggregators that capture the economic activity of the gig economy in a much more organised fashion. Besides, data from some of the platforms are also expected to provide proxy information that can be extrapolated for some of the activities in the unorganised sector, officials told TOI.The changes in the economy have also resulted in the development of a host of other services in an organised fashion, logistics being a case in point, which has expanded beyond moving cargo by rail or through trucks to a wider network covering air and intra-city movement of goods.With GST coming into the picture since the last series was drawn, data flow has further improved, helping authorities work out the new series that captures more economic activity in the country. The e-way bills used by GST authorities have also emerged as a robust tool to capture movement of goods within the country. Besides, there has been a massive surge in digital payments, thanks to the advent of UPI, which will again help track economic activity better.Further, the ministry of statistics and programme implementation's (Mospi) Annual Survey of Unincorporated Sector Enterprises that measures the activity in the non-agricultural units has enabled it to capture data very well, which will all feed into the GDP calculations.""We have a lot more data on the production and consumption side which will help provide a better assessment of the economy,"" said an official.The new series will move the base to 2022-23 from 2011-12 at present, helping provide a much more contemporary view of the economy which has seen a massive transformation in the last 12-13 years with the digital economy playing a much bigger role.The new series is expected to be released late Feb with the second advance estimates.","The new GDP series is due to be released early next year.

What’s the gold price outlook till next Dhanteras?

Gold — Diwali/Dhanteras 2026 target: ₹1,40,000–₹1,45,000+ Bull case 160000+ if geopolitical risk escalates or Fed turns very dovish. For the 12-month horizon to Dhanteras 2026, maintaining the bullish structural view, expect upside if the macro tailwinds persist — Fed cuts, weak dollar, tariffs/ geopolitical premium.Since the price has shown sharp up move recently, its advisable to allocate in dips and parts.

Silver — Dhanteras/Diwali 2026 target: ₹1,85,000–₹2,10,000/kg; Bull case ₹2,20,000–₹2,50,000+ on stronger industrial demand Central banks buying and continued ETF flows.

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market and other asset classes given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)





Buying gold and silver is traditionally considered auspicious on Dhanteras . The precious metals have been hitting new record highs this year - with the gold rally backed by global uncertainty and diversification away from dollar and the silver bull run driven by high industrial demand and acute physical tightness in London and Comex inventories.Investors who bet on gold and silver last Dhanteras and Diwali have seen bonanza returns. According to Manav Modi, Senior Analyst, Commodity Research at Motilal Oswal Financial Services, gold and silver on the domestic front have gained by over 61% and 69% respectively from 2024 Dhanteras to till now.Manav Modi is of the view that both gold and silver could be on dips from a long term perspective as an investment. “However, one should be cautious at these levels for a dip or profit booking which could provide a better entry or purchase level,” he tells TOI.Jateen Trivedi, VP Research Analyst - Commodity and Currency, LKP Securities believes that while gold and silver are good bets, investors should not chase the peak.“For festival buying (ritual/jewellery) buy as per need; for investment, favoursystematic accumulation (SIP/laddered buys), ETFs or Sovereign Gold Bonds (SGBs) over lump-sum physical purchases at all-time highs. Silver offers higher upside potential but comes with higher volatility,” he advises.Praveen Singh, Head of Commodities, Mirae Asset ShareKhan says that both gold and silver have strong fundamentals to rise further in the coming years.“⁠Both the metals are expected to gain further on economic, political, and geopolitical uncertainties as the US Federal Reserve cuts rates into elevated inflation. De-dollarization, central banks buying gold, inflation hedge buying, long-term government bonds losing their appeal, dent in investors’ trust in US institutions, and tariff wars will continue to provide strong tailwinds for precious metals,” he tells TOI.Gold and Silver are still poised for further upside, says Manav Modi. “Overall, from a one year perspective, Gold on COMEX could target $4250 and $4500 assuming USD-INR at 89; Rs 1,28,500 and 1,35,000. Similarly, Silver could target $75 on COMEX, from a long term perspective and Rs 2,30,000 on domestic front,” he says.Praveen Singh expects gold to reach $5000 sometime around next Dhanteras, while silver is expected to rise to $60 level. “So, silver can gain 17%, while gold may gain 21% in a year. However, due to physical market tightness in London and Indian Silver markets, it is possible that silver may beat gold in the short term, though we expect that this tightness will not last long,” he says.Abhilash Koikkara, EVP & Head- Forex and Commodities, Nuvama Professional Clients Group is of the view that over the next 12 months, silver could maintain its outperformance over gold as gold offers portfolio stability and capital protection. “From a technical perspective, silver exhibits stronger bullish signals compared to gold, indicating a higher likelihood of outperforming gold by Dhanteras 2026,” he tells TOI.“Analytically, gold suits conservative wealth preservation, while silver suits risk-adjusted alpha seekers,” he adds.Trivedi notes that Gold has compounded at roughly 30.6% p.a., Silver 33% p.a., and Nifty 24% p.a. — silver has outperformed in percentage terms recently though gold remains the steadier hedge.Trivedi highlights LKP Securities’s working framework and targets (domestic, per 10 g / per kg):","Investors who bet on gold and silver last Dhanteras and Diwali have seen bonanza returns. Both the metals are expected to gain further on economic, political, and geopolitical uncertainties as the US Federal Reserve cuts rates into elevated inflation.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124665282,imgsize-56388,width-400,resizemode-4/gold-price-outlook.jpg"
the inspiring story of how Indian immigrant Money Singh built his American dream,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/from-6-an-hour-to-2-million-a-year-the-inspiring-story-of-how-indian-immigrant-money-singh-built-his-american-dream/articleshow/124829628.cms,"Next stop — Singh’s Barbershop

Building a business



Still working hard…







Moving halfway across the world at 19 might make one feel alone, uncertain, and homesick. But that’s how Money Singh’s story in America began, which took him from being a depressed teen to owning multiple businesses in the US.Recalling his early days in San Francisco after leaving Punjab in 2006, Singh said, “I was [depressed] for that one year. I wanted to go back.”What started as a reluctant move eventually turned out to be the beginning of his American dream, that made him go from a cab dispatcher earning $6 an hour to running two successful businesses worth over a million dollars each, CNBC reported.His first years in the Bay Area were far from easy. Singh enrolled in college but dropped out when he realised his credits from India wouldn’t transfer. When Singh’s mother urged him to work, he took a short stint at a local drugstore before joining his uncle’s cab company.The next 12 years were spent in the taxi business. Singh drove his own cab, built a small five-car fleet, started his own dispatch company, and later launched Driver’s Network, a marketing agency for independent drivers.By 2018, he was ready for a new challenge. And hence, alongside his existing venture, now known as ATCS Platform Solutions, Singh decided to try something entirely different route, a barbershop.With help from his partner Joypreet and inspiration from his mother, a salon owner in both India and Northern California, Singh opened Dandies Barbershop & Beard Stylist in Mountain View in June 2019.It was a gamble, but it paid off. According to documents reviewed by CNBC Make It, Dandies generated $1.07 million in sales last year, while ATCS brought in $1.18 million in revenue. Both businesses are profitable, and Singh splits his time between them, full-time at Dandies and around 20 hours a week on ATCS.Before the success came struggle. Singh invested $75,000 from his taxi savings and spent a year battling permits and paperwork. “You have to go through permitting. You have to go through dealing with the city,” he told CNBC.“It took me a solid year to get the license to even open the shop, so I was paying rent for one year before I could open the shop.”He had no experience as a barber, so he partnered with a friend. Then, six months later, the Covid-19 pandemic hit. His partner left due to a family emergency, forcing Singh to shut down the shop for almost a year, though the rent bills never stopped.To keep Dandies alive, Singh pulled every financial lever available. He received two Paycheck Protection Program loans, one for $68,000 and another for $18,000, the latter eventually forgiven. He borrowed $20,000 from friends, withdrew $30,000 from his life insurance, built up $80,000 in credit card debt, and even sold his stock portfolio.“I had to sell everything,” he told CNBC. “I had to eat less. I literally had to focus on eating $1 per meal to make sure the business stays open.”During the shutdown, Singh joined barber school so that he could expand services when Dandies reopened in 2021. The move worked. “As we got more engaged with the community, I had a lot of people from every aspect of life: Men, women, LGBTQ, kids. Almost everybody wanted to come to Dandies,” he says. “So we started expanding into different skill sets and we wanted to cater to everybody.”Today, Dandies has three locations, 25 employees, including 15 barbers and consistent profits. Singh takes home around $7,000 per month, divided between $3,000 from Dandies and $4,000 from ATCS. He’s paid off his credit cards and insurance loans, and now repays about $300 a month on his remaining PPP loan.Growing up in Punjab during the violent clashes between Sikh separatists and the government, his family faced repeated tragedies. His father survived being shot by a terrorist back in 1988. Three years later, a bomb exploded outside the family’s convenience store, and later, floods destroyed what remained.“I just don’t feel any different. I’m doing the same thing that I was doing 19 years ago,” Singh says. “I still work 15 to 16 hours a day. I still work hard. I still do the things that I need to do ... Those are the habits that I’ve developed since my childhood.”Now, Singh is preparing for his next leap, a new app called Barber’s Network, which will let barbers and clients book chairs and appointments across the US, similar to platforms like Booksy or theCut. He’s funding the development with profits from Dandies, CNBC reported.Slowing down? That’s not on his list. “I don’t think I’ll ever retire. I would want to work all the way through,” he says. “That’s just what I breathe.”",Money Singh moved from Punjab to San Francisco at the age of 19. He went from a cab dispatcher earning $6 an hour to running two successful businesses worth over a million dollars each. He now runs Dandies Barbershop & Beard Stylist and ATCS Platform Solutions.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124829912,imgsize-148074,width-400,resizemode-4/this-is-an-ai-generated-image-used-only-for-representative-purpose.jpg"
Explained: How Mark Carney is trying to reassure Canadians after Trump’s tariff threats,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/explained-how-mark-carney-is-trying-to-reassure-canadians-after-trumps-tariff-threats/articleshow/124827500.cms,"

The big picture

Canada’s Reagan Ad ‘Trump Card’ Ends U.S. Trade Talks | What Is Trump So Angry About

Driving the news

Carney’s response

What’s behind Trump’s anger?



Tariffs so far

50% on steel and aluminium

25% on automobiles

Over 45% on softwood lumber (after an additional 10% hike)

35% on trade outside the USMCA

25% tariff on trucks starting November 1, alongside new levies on pharmaceuticals and furniture

Domestic reaction in Canada

The road ahead

Bottom line





Prime Minister Mark Carney is trying to project calm and control after US President Donald Trump raised tariffs on Canadian imports by another 10%. The escalation, triggered by a provincial TV ad during the World Series, has reignited the trade tensions that Carney had hoped to cool.The US and Canada are once again on the brink of a full-scale trade war. Trump’s latest tariffs come after Ottawa and Washington had already been negotiating a truce over previous trade restrictions. This time, the spark wasn’t steel or lumber, but a one-minute television spot from Ontario invoking Ronald Reagan to criticise American protectionism.For Carney, the political optics are tricky. He must reassure Canadian businesses and consumers while showing the US that Canada will not be bullied by sudden outbursts from the White House.Trump announced a 10% hike on Canadian imports after an Ontario government-funded ad aired during Game 1 of the World Series. The ad used 1980s footage of Ronald Reagan criticising tariffs, something Trump claims was taken “out of context.” He demanded the ad be pulled “immediately” and accused Canada of running “fraudulent” propaganda.Ontario Premier Doug Ford said he would remove the ad after the weekend, but the damage was done.Trump abruptly broke off trade talks and announced the tariff increase.Speaking from Kuala Lumpur, where he’s attending the ASEAN Business and Investment Summit, Carney said his government is “ready to resume trade negotiations” and will unveil an “ambitious budget” in two weeks featuring “generational investments” in the domestic economy.He emphasised diversification, shifting Canada’s trade focus toward Asia to reduce reliance on the United States, which he described as an “unpredictable and unreliable partner.” Carney also confirmed plans to finalise a free-trade deal with ASEAN nations by next year, along with a parallel pact with the Philippines.In an apparent dig at Trump, Carney said:“It underscores the importance of reliable partners who honour their commitments.”Trump’s reaction appears less about economic policy and more about optics. The 60-second Ontario ad was produced and paid for by the province, not Ottawa, but Trump viewed it as an affront to his trade policies.In Reagan’s original 1980s radio address, he actually defended certain tariffs on Japan but warned that widespread protectionism hurts Americans. The Ontario ad highlighted only the latter point, leading Trump to claim it misrepresented Reagan’s message.The US under Trump has already imposed a range of levies on Canadian exports:Canadian industries are reeling, with the automotive, lumber, and manufacturing sectors hit hardest.Flavio Volpe, head of the Automotive Parts Manufacturers’ Association, called the new tariffs “unprovoked and unwarranted,” warning that they will raise costs for US consumers more than Canadians.Jason Kenney, former Alberta premier, defended the Ontario ad as a faithful replay of Reagan’s remarks.Goldy Hyder, CEO of the Business Council of Canada, criticised provincial freelancing on foreign policy:“You don’t see governor after governor on television... Canada can’t have premiers freelancing on the US relationship.”Carney used similar language, stressing that only the federal government conducts international trade talks.This is the second time Trump has walked away from talks with Canada this year. In June, he halted negotiations after Ottawa passed a digital sales tax on US tech firms, resuming only after Carney repealed the measure.Carney’s challenge now is balancing economic reassurance at home with diplomatic composure abroad. He must convince Canadians that their government can weather Trump’s volatility while proving to Washington that Canada will not be drawn into political theatrics over a one-minute ad.Carney’s message is clear. Canada will not be hostage to Trump’s temper. His plan is to build resilience at home, expand markets abroad, and wait for the storm to pass. For now, though, the price of political theatre is another 10% at the border.","The US and Canada are once again on the brink of a full-scale trade war.

FULL: Trump’s 'Bad Years' Note For China On Tariffs, Taiwan; Big Message To Putin, Kim Jong Un





US treasury secretary Scott Bessent said on Sunday that Washington and Beijing have reached a “very substantial framework” that would prevent the US from imposing 100% tariffs on Chinese goods and allow for a deferral of China’s rare earths export controls, as per news agency Reuters.The development follows high-level talks in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, ahead of a scheduled meeting between President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping next week.Bessent told NBC’s “Meet the Press” that the framework will enable discussions on more balanced US-China trade, Chinese purchases of American soybeans and other agricultural products, and measures to address the US fentanyl crisis.“No, I’m not [anticipating the 100% tariffs], and I’m also anticipating that we will get some kind of a deferral on the rare earth export controls that the Chinese had discussed,” he said.Final terms are expected to be decided by Trump and Xi, he added.The talks come as tensions have escalated in recent weeks. Trump had threatened new triple-digit tariffs starting on November 1 in response to China’s expanded controls on rare earth magnets and minerals.The US and China previously rolled back most of their tariffs under a trade truce signed in May, which is due to expire on November 10. Bessent said the truce could be extended pending the president’s decision.Economic officials from both countries, including China’s Vice Premier He Lifeng and top trade negotiator Li Chenggang, held discussions with Bessent and US trade representative Jamieson Greer on the sidelines of the Asean summit Li said a preliminary consensus was reached on a range of issues, including the extension of the trade truce, fentanyl and export controls, though he did not provide specific details.Trump, who arrived in Malaysia on Sunday for the Asean summit, expressed confidence about a deal.“I think we have a very successful framework for the leaders to discuss on Thursday,” Bessent told reporters, while Trump said, “I think we’re going to have a deal with China”, according to Reuters.The US president also indicated the possibility of additional meetings with Xi in China and the United States.The framework aims to de-escalate the fragile trade war, which has involved repeated sanctions, export curbs, and threats of retaliatory measures.Among the key issues on the agenda for Trump-Xi talks are Chinese purchases of US soybeans, Taiwan, and the release of jailed Hong Kong media tycoon Jimmy Lai.The rare earth export controls have caused global supply concerns, prompting Washington to consider restrictions on software-powered exports to China, including laptops and jet engines.The outcome of the Kuala Lumpur talks is expected to clear the way for Trump and Xi to meet next week in South Korea, though Beijing has yet to officially confirm the face-to-face summit.","US treasury secretary Scott Bessent said Washington and Beijing have reached a “very substantial framework” that would prevent the US from imposing 100% tariffs on Chinese goods.

US President Donald Trump signed a trade agreement with Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim and took part in the signing of a historic peace deal between Cambodia and Thailand, called the “Kuala Lumpur Peace Accords”.Trump arrived in the country to attend the ongoing ASEAN Summit ""Today, the Prime Minister and I signed a major trade deal between the United States and Malaysia.""Speaking at the ceremony, described his visit as “a mission of friendship and goodwill” aimed at deepening commerce, strengthening security, and promoting “stability, prosperity and peace” across the region.He added, “That’s why I’m delighted that in addition to the agreement with Malaysia this week, we’re also signing or nearing completion on trade deals with many other Indo Pacific partners. From Cambodia to Japan to South Korea, we’re delighted to forge richer partnerships on energy, technology, artificial intelligence, critical minerals and other industries.”The US President further hailed America’s economic performance, saying, “The United States is having its golden age. Last year we were a country that was doing very poorly under a different semi leadership. I don’t even call it a leadership.But this year we’re doing numbers that nobody ever thought it was possible for any country to do. We’ll be at the end of my first year, over $20 trillion worth of investment into the United States. There’s no country anywhere that’s ever done anything close to that. The United States last year, for the four years it was announced, did less than $1 trillion. And we’re going to be doing over 20. That’s quite a difference.”He emphasised America’s commitment to Southeast Asia, stating, “The United States is for you. It’s committed to a free and open and thriving Indo Pacific. My message to the nations of Southeast Asia is that the United States is with you 100%. And we intend to be a strong partner and friend for many generations to come.”Trump’s visit marks his first ASEAN summit since 2017 and his first trip to Asia in his second term. Large crowds gathered at the airport to welcome him, as he was received by Prime Minister Anwar and other Malaysian officials. Analysts say the visit aims to reaffirm US engagement in the Indo-Pacific and showcase Trump’s role as a global negotiator amid ongoing trade tensions.The US President explained the Malaysia stop was also a gesture of thanks to Anwar for his country’s role in resolving the conflict between Thailand and Cambodia.Ahead of his broader tour, Trump allso expressed optimism about a potential meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping, describing a “really good chance” of reaching a comprehensive deal focused on technology and trade, particularly rare earth exports.

Industry reactions





Several major US employers have paused or limited the sponsorship for H-1B visas after the Trump administration imposed a $100,000 fee for new applications.The fee, aimed at new applicants, does not affect current visa holders or renewals.The administration said that the reform is intended to attract highly skilled foreign workers while preventing misuse of the programme to undercut American wages. However, critics argue the fee could deter companies from hiring international talent and reduce America’s competitiveness in technology and innovation, Newsweek reported.The US chamber of commerce has filed a lawsuit challenging the fee, describing it as “cost-prohibitive for US employers, especially start-ups and small and midsize businesses.”The fee applies only to applicants outside the United States who do not hold a valid visa. Current H-1B holders, renewals, and those changing visa types, such as moving from an F-1 student visa to H-1B, are exempted.Mark Koestler, US head of business immigration at law firm HSF Kramer, told Newsweek, “In simple terms, the super fee will not apply to individuals in the United States in valid status (as long as the H-1B filing for them requests a change of status, extension of status, or amendment).”“It will, however, apply to those who are outside the United States without a valid, current US immigration status,” the agency further cited.Some firms, like Nvidia, will continue sponsoring H-1B applicants. CEO Jensen Huang confirmed in a memo that the company will “continue to sponsor H-1B applicants and cover all associated fees.”Neil Bradley, executive vice president at the US chamber of commerce, told Newsweek, “The new $100,000 visa fee will make it cost-prohibitive for US employers, especially start-ups and small and midsize businesses, to utilize the H-1B program, which was created by Congress expressly to ensure that American businesses of all sizes can access the global talent they need to grow their operations here in the US.”Immigration attorney Divij Kishore also warned, “Over time, this policy could narrow the diversity and skill depth of the US workforce.

US Fed rate cuts: America might still see another rate cut in 2025; govt shutdown clouds economic outlook,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-fed-rate-cuts-america-might-still-see-another-rate-cut-in-2025-govt-shutdown-clouds-economic-outlook/articleshow/124821490.cms,"



The US may see another rate cut this year, even as uncertainty looms over the economy due to the ongoing US government shutdown.The Federal Reserve's second-to-last rate meeting of 2025 takes place amid a standoff between Republicans and Democrats over healthcare subsidies, which has halted the publication of nearly all official economic data. Without these insights, officials must decide on interest rates without the comprehensive information they usually rely upon.Analysts expect the Fed to proceed with a quarter percentage-point cut, lowering its key lending rate to between 3.75 and 4.00%, while remaining cautious about signalling any final rate move in December.The shutdown has intensified debate within the Fed. Policymakers are weighing whether to cut rates quickly to support a weakening labour market or hold steady in the face of inflation that remains stubbornly above the bank’s long-term target of 2%, partly driven by Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs on major trading partners.""They'll have to decide how much (inflation) is still to come versus how much is just never going to come, and that's the big question right now,"" former Fed official Joseph Gagnon told AFP. He added that “the strength and inflation is only temporary... but the weakness of unemployment might be more long lasting.”""In my view, that argument is going to continue to hold sway this month, because the data are still in that direction,"" Gagnon, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics (PIIE), said.Since the shutdown began on October 1, the only major data released was US consumer inflation, which showed a 3% rise over the year to September, slightly below expectations. The news buoyed financial markets, with stocks closing at fresh records.The Fed, however, relies on a different inflation measure, which remains well above its target according to pre-shutdown data.Employment has also slowed in recent months, with only 22,000 jobs added in August, although the unemployment rate remained low at 4.3%.""The goal is to get it just right, and that's a hard thing to do with such a blunt tool,"" KPMG chief economist Diane Swonk told AFP, referring to the Fed’s key interest rate. Swonk expects two more rate cuts this year and predicts the central bank will also announce an end to its quantitative tightening programme next week amid rising liquidity risks.Political pressures have added to the Fed’s challenges. President Trump has repeatedly attacked chair Jerome Powell on his Truth Social platform and has also sought to remove Fed governor Lisa Cook over alleged mortgage fraud.Cook has contested the removal, taking the case to the US Supreme Court, which is scheduled to hear arguments in January. A ruling is unlikely before February, the deadline for the Fed board to decide on reappointing regional Fed presidents, a process conducted only once every five years.""It seems like the odds that he could do this maneuver are greatly diminished,"" Gagnon said, referring to the administration’s efforts to influence the Fed’s appointments.",The Federal Reserve's second-to-last rate meeting of 2025 takes place amid a standoff between Republicans and Democrats over healthcare subsidies.

Canada’s Reagan Ad ‘Trump Card’ Ends U.S. Trade Talks | What Is Trump So Angry About





US President Donald Trump announced on Saturday that he is increasing tariffs on Canadian goods by an additional 10 per cent, in response to a Canadian advertisement featuring late US leader Ronald Reagan The move comes just two days after Trump ""ended"" all trade talks with Canada, criticising what he called a “fake” ad campaign.On his Truth Social platform, Trump wrote: ""Their advertisement was to be taken down immediately, but they let it run last night during the World Series, knowing that it was a fraud. Because of their serious misrepresentation of the facts, and hostile act, I am increasing the tariff on Canada by 10% over and above what they are paying now.""The ad, produced by the Canadian province of Ontario, used quotes from a 1987 radio address by Reagan in which he warned that high tariffs could provoke retaliation from other countries and trigger trade wars. The quotes match the transcript available on the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library’s website.The Reagan Foundation criticised the ad, stating that it used “selective audio and video” and is reviewing potential legal options.Trump’s sectoral tariffs on steel, aluminum, and autos have already affected Canada’s economy, causing job losses and straining businesses. Despite this, the United States and Canada continue to operate under the USMCA trade agreement, which allows roughly 85 per cent of cross-border trade to remain tariff-free.Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, speaking on Wednesday, described the US tariffs as “levels last seen during the Great Depression” and stressed that Canada’s economic strategy would need significant adjustments, a process that would take time and sacrifices.","US President Donald Trump announced on Saturday that he is increasing tariffs on Canadian goods by an additional 10 per cent.

'Hostile...': Explosive Europe Vs China Standoff Over Rare Earths; Ursula Vows 'Retaliation' With G7





The European Union is moving to reduce its reliance on China for critical raw materials, following Beijing’s latest export restrictions on rare earths and battery materials.EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen on Saturday said the bloc is preparing a new strategy, named RESourceEU, to secure alternative sources of these minerals crucial for industries such as automotive, defence, aerospace, AI chips, and data centres, reported news agency Reuters.“Over 90% of our consumption of rare earth magnets comes from imports from China. You see the risks here for Europe and its most strategic industrial sectors,” von der Leyen said at the Berlin Global Dialogue, warning of the economic impact of China’s controls.She emphasised that the EU will focus on recycling, production, and post-processing of critical raw materials, noting that some companies can recycle up to 95% of materials from products and batteries, as per news agency AFP.The REsourceEU plan will also accelerate partnerships with countries such as Australia, Canada, Chile, Greenland, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Ukraine, aiming to diversify supply chains and reduce Europe’s vulnerability.The EU intends to follow a model similar to REPowerEU, the 2022 plan that reduced dependence on Russian fossil fuels through investments, diversification, and legislative measures.Von der Leyen acknowledged the need for short-term engagement with Chinese counterparts but stressed that the EU is prepared to deploy all available tools, including the Anti-Coercion Instrument, if necessary, to counter potential economic coercion.She described China’s recent moves as “clear acceleration and escalation in the way interdependencies are leveraged and weaponized”, as per Politico.The EU’s new initiative highlights a strategic pivot to secure supply chains for high-tech and defence sectors, balancing short-term resilience with long-term industrial independence.The bloc aims to exploit circular economy opportunities and accelerate domestic production to mitigate risks from over-reliance on a single supplier.Overall, the REsourceEU plan seeks to ensure Europe’s industries have reliable access to critical raw materials in the short, medium, and long term, strengthening economic and technological security while reducing exposure to geopolitical leverage from China.","EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the bloc is preparing a new strategy, named RESourceEU, to secure alternative sources of these minerals.

Pakistan’s economy collapsing? Public debt rises to $286.8 billion; debt-to-GDP ratio hits 70%,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/pakistans-economy-collapsing-public-debt-rises-to-286-8-billion-debt-to-gdp-ratio-hits-70/articleshow/124809439.cms,"Representative image





Pakistan’s total public debt reached $286.832 billion (PKR 80.6 trillion) as of June 2025, almost 13% higher than the previous year, according to official data released by the ministry of finance in its Annual Debt Review for FY25.Of this, domestic debt stood at PKR 54.5 trillion while external debt was PKR 26.0 trillion, according to news agency PTI.The data showed the debt-to-GDP ratio increased to around 70% in June 2025, up from 68% a year earlier.The report attributed the rise primarily to lower-than-expected nominal GDP growth, with subdued inflation slowing economic expansion despite fiscal consolidation efforts.Domestic debt rose 15% year-on-year—the lowest increase in three fiscal years—while external debt increased by 6% to $91.8 billion.The external debt growth was supported by disbursements from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), an ADB-guarantee-backed commercial loan of $1 billion, and inflows from other multilateral institutions, as per PTI.Provincial debt also increased, with Pakistan’s Punjab as the largest borrower at $6.18 billion (7%), followed by Sindh at $4.67 billion (5%), which recorded the sharpest rise.Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s debt reached $2.77 billion, Baluchistan $371 million, and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir $281 million.Overall, 84% of external public debt is held by the federal government and 16% by provinces.Pakistan’s economy has been gradually recovering after two years of instability. The IMF had recently reached a staff-level agreement with Islamabad on loan programmes, enabling access to $1.2 billion under its Extended Fund Facility and Resilience and Sustainability Facility, pending board approval.The agreement aims to strengthen macroeconomic stability, rebuild market confidence, and support fiscal and structural reforms.The Economic Survey 2024–25 had indicated Pakistan’s economy grew 2.5% in 2024, with projected 2.7% growth for 2025.Fiscal improvements included a current account surplus of $1.9 billion during July–April FY25, and rising remittances estimated at $37–38 billion by year-end.The survey also noted external reserves had increased to $16.64 billion by June 2025, reflecting improved investor confidence and global ratings upgrades.","Pakistan’s total public debt reached $286.832 billion (PKR 80.6 trillion) as of June 2025.

Why “inflation slows” doesn’t mean “crisis over”

The bottom line





For almost two years, prices in the United States have been climbing faster than most people’s paychecks. Groceries, rent, fuel, and electricity all went up, squeezing budgets and forcing families to cut back. Now there’s finally a bit of good news: inflation is slowing. Prices in September rose 3% compared to a year earlier, a little less than what experts had expected.That may sound like a small change, but it matters. It suggests that the wave of high prices that began during the pandemic could finally be losing strength. For Americans, it might mean cheaper loans and a little more stability in household budgets. For the rest of the world, including India, it’s a sign that the global economy may be settling after years of turmoil.Still, prices are not falling, only rising more slowly. Inflation remains above what the US Federal Reserve considers healthy, so the question now is whether this slowdown will last long enough for the Fed to start cutting interest rates.In September 2025, prices in the US went up 3% from a year earlier, slightly below forecasts of 3.1%. On a month-to-month basis, they rose about 0.3%. Core inflation, which leaves out food and fuel, stayed steady at around 3%.Inflation has come a long way down from its pandemic peak of over 8%, but it’s still higher than the Fed’s goal of around 2%. The latest numbers show progress but also caution: the fight against rising prices is slowing, not over.: If inflation keeps easing, the Fed may cut interest rates soon. That could make home loans, car loans, and business borrowing cheaper.When inflation slows, your money holds its value better, so you can buy more with the same amount.: Lower prices can boost spending, helping shops, companies, and jobs.Around the world: The US is the world’s biggest economy. When its inflation changes, it affects currencies, trade, and commodity prices everywhere — including India.The inflation report for September came out later than usual because of a short government shutdown. When it was finally released, it showed prices rising a little less than expected.Earlier forecasts had suggested that tariffs on imports and high energy costs might push prices up again. But both stabilised, and that helped keep inflation in check.After the pandemic, supply chains broke down and goods became scarce. At the same time, governments pumped money into the economy to keep people afloat. The result was a sharp jump in prices across almost everything.By 2022, inflation in the US was above 8%. To slow it, the Fed raised interest rates, which made loans costlier and cooled spending. That strategy worked: inflation dropped through 2023 and 2024.By mid-2025, inflation had settled near 2.7%, but new import taxes and rising service costs caused a small rebound. Now, it seems to be easing again. Some economists think 3% could become the “new normal” — slightly higher than before the pandemic, but stable enough for steady growth.The central bank will decide whether to cut interest rates or wait for more data.: If job growth slows and people spend less, rate cuts become more likely.: New import taxes could still make certain goods costlier.: Other big economies are also seeing around 3% inflation, which could shape trade and investment patterns.It’s encouraging that inflation is cooling, but it’s not over yet. Prices are still rising, just not as quickly. Everyday costs like rent, healthcare, and groceries remain high for many families. And inflation could climb again if oil prices or tariffs rise.In short, inflation slowing is a relief, not a rescue.Inflation at 3% shows progress, not perfection. The US has avoided the runaway prices of the pandemic years, but stability is still some distance away.The Fed’s next move — whether to cut or hold rates — will decide how quickly the world’s biggest economy regains its balance. For now, things are moving in the right direction. If this trend continues, cheaper loans and steadier prices could soon follow.","Prices in September rose 3% compared to a year earlier, a little less than what experts had expected.

Canadian officials respond to tariffs





Canada on Friday said that it will pause the anti-tariff advertisement campaign that prompted US President Donald Trump to abruptly end trade negotiations, as confirmed by Ontario Premier Doug Ford.Ford said the decision comes after discussions with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and the campaign will be paused from Monday to allow talks to resume, news agency AP reported.“Our intention was always to initiate a conversation about the kind of economy that Americans want to build and the impact of tariffs on workers and businesses,” Ford said.Despite the controversy, he added that the ad would continue to air over the weekend, including during the first World Series games featuring the Toronto Blue Jays.“I’ve directed my team to keep putting our message in front of Americans over the weekend so that we can air our commercial during the first two World Series games,” he said.Ford acknowledged that Trump had likely seen the ad and said, “I’m sure he wasn’t too happy.”The Ontario premier added that the aim was to “blast” the pro-trade message to Americans.“It’s real, because it was coming from the best president the country’s ever seen, Ronald Reagan . I feel the Reagan Republicans are going to be fighting with the MAGA group, and let's hope Reagan Republicans win,” Ford said.The 60-second ad featured edited clips from Reagan’s April 25, 1987 national radio address, where he spoke passionately in favour of free and fair trade and warned against the dangers of tariffs.In the speech, Reagan said the US had “clear evidence that Japanese companies were engaging in unfair trade practices,” but stressed he was “loath” to impose tariffs, warning that they hurt workers and fuelled trade wars.Trump on Friday indicated that he does not plan to meet with Mark Carney ahead of his trip to Asia.Speaking to reporter about the advertisement, Trump said: “What they did is really dishonest. And I heard they were pulling the ad. I didn't know they were putting it on a little bit more. They could have pulled it tonight.”""Well, that's dirty playing, but I can play dirtier than they can,"" he added.Earlier, Trump had criticised the ad on social media, calling it “fake” and accusing Canada of misusing Reagan’s words to influence American policy.He also linked the ad to an upcoming US Supreme Court ruling on his global tariff regime and declared an immediate halt to trade talks.In a post on Truth Social, he wrote: “The Ronald Reagan Foundation has just announced that Canada has fraudulently used an advertisement, which is FAKE, featuring Ronald Reagan speaking negatively about Tariffs.”“Based on their egregious behavior, all trade negotiations with Canada are hereby terminated,” his post added.The Ronald Reagan Foundation echoed Trump’s criticism, calling the ad a “misrepresentation” and said it is reviewing legal options.""The ad misrepresents the Presidential Radio Address, and the Government of Ontario did not seek nor receive permission to use and edit the remarks. The Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute is reviewing its legal option in this matter,” the Foundation wrote in a post on X.White House spokesman Kush Desai said talks with Canada had not produced constructive results.“Ontario’s taxpayer-funded ad campaign on American TV networks — that misleadingly edited President Reagan’s 1987 radio address about trade — is the latest example of how Canadian officials would rather play games than engage with the Administration,"" Desai said in a statement.“As President Trump made clear on Truth Social, further talks are a futile effort if Canada can’t be serious.”The advertisement, which cost about $ 75 million Canadian (US$54 million), used clips from Reagan’s 1987 radio address opposing tariffs. It featured workers, families, and businesses, warning that high tariffs could trigger trade wars, shrink markets and cost jobs.The ad was aired on multiple major US networks.Ford shared quotes from Reagan on social media, highlighting Reagan’s opposition to tariffs.“Canada and the US are friends, neighbours and allies, and Reagan knew that both are stronger together,” Ford said.He defended the ad as factual and intended to reach US audiences at the highest levels. “We’ve achieved our goal, having reached US audiences at the highest levels,” he added.Canadian Prime Minister Carney said Canada aims to double exports to countries outside the US in response to Trump’s tariffs and remains ready to negotiate in sectors affected by trade barriers, including aluminum, steel, autos and lumber.“We can’t control the trade policy of the United States. We recognize that the policy has fundamentally changed from the 1980s. We have to focus on what we can control and realize what we can’t control,” he said.The ad has sparked debate across Canada. Former Conservative minister Jason Kenney defended it as an accurate replay of Reagan’s words, saying: “The Ontario ad does not misrepresent President Reagan’s anti-tariff radio address in any respect whatsoever. It is a direct replay of his radio address, formatted for a one-minute ad.”Kenney also criticised the Reagan Foundation’s response, calling its leadership “gormless” and “easily intimidated by a call from the White House.”Premiers Wab Kinew of Manitoba and David Eby of British Columbia expressed support for Ford.Kinew said, “It’s clear that these ads are working. If you throw a rock at a lake and you don’t hear a splash, you probably missed. To my good friend Doug Ford, keep the ads on TV. They’re effective, and this country is behind you.”Trade tensions between Canada and the US have intensified in recent months, with Trump’s tariffs affecting the auto and steel industries, while Canada has imposed retaliatory levies on certain US imports.","Canada will pause anti-tariff advertisement campaign that prompted US President Donald Trump to abruptly end trade negotiations.

Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Explainer: What is 'Hindu rate of growth' and why Raghuram Rajan's remarks may be 'premature',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/explainer-what-is-hindu-rate-of-growth-and-why-raghuram-rajans-remarks-may-be-premature/articleshow/98482598.cms,"What is meant by Hindu growth rate

How India's GDP has been growing

What SBI report said on savings and investment

Incremental capital output ratio

NEW DELHI: India's gross domestic product (GDP) data for the third quarter (October-December 2022) received a word of caution from the former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan In an interview with news agency PTI, Rajan that India is ""dangerously close"" to the Hindu rate of growth in view of subdued private sector investment, high interest rates and slowing global growth.India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying"".However, a report released by the State Bank of India (SBI) economists on Tuesday dismissed arguments that India is dangerously close to Hindu rate of growth saying such statements are ""ill-conceived, biased and premature"".The term 'Hindu growth rate' was coined by late economist Raj Krishna in 1978 to describe the slow growth in the country.It basically refers to the low pace of economic growth rates during 1950s to 1980s. During this period, the Indian economy averaged 3.5%.A former lecturer at the Delhi School of Economics (DSE), Krishna noted that only if the rate of growth is persistently slow and accompanied by low per-capita GDP, then it will be known as Hindu rate of growth but it has to factor in population growth as well.Before economic reforms of 1991, India's economic growth remained stagnant and low, while per capita income averaged around 1.3%.Krishna termed this low growth situation to be a result of socialist policies of state control and import substitution.However, the economic situation changed when liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation (LPG) reforms came into effect in the year 1991, at a time when India faced balance of payment crisis.Over the years, many economists have strongly opposed the idea of 'Hindu growth rate' and the term never had universal acceptance.The Indian economy plunged into its very first technical recession in FY21 due to the impact of Covid-19 pandemic and the related nationwide lockdowns. GDP shrunk by an unprecedented 23.8% in the first quarter of the financial year 2020-21. However, due to spurt in economic activities in the subsequent quarters, the GDP decline started to narrow.However, if we look at the period before Covid-19 as well, India's growth curve shows a declining trend.From 8.26% in FY17, GDP growth plunged to 3.74% in FY20. Shutdown of economic activities in FY21 in wake of Covid-19 only made matters worse.As lockdowns started to ease and business activities resumed, India's GDP also started rising. In Q1 of FY22, growth jumped to 20.1% mainly on account of low base effect. By the fourth quarter of FY22, growth came down to 4.10%.Similarly, the new financial year 2022-23 brought fresh economic challenges in the form of Russia-Ukraine war that impacted almost all major economies of the world, slowed the pace of growth, pushed inflation to record highs.As a result, the central banks of all advanced economies spurred into action and opted for monetary policy tightening to curb the soaring inflation.With persistently rising interest rates, India's economy grew by 4.4% in Q3 of FY23, as the Centre revised upwards GDP growth for previous year to 9.10% from 8.7% earlier.The report weighed recent GDP numbers against the available data on savings and investments for the past decade and highlighted some interesting points.""Quarterly growth numbers are noisy and should be best avoided for any serious interpretation (on an average, India's GDP growth has witnessed Rs 2 lakh crore upward revision for the 3 year ended FY23),"" the report said.Gross capital formation (GCF) by the government touched a high of 11.8% in 2021-22, up from 10.7% in 2020-21.""This also had a domino effect on private sector investment that jumped from 10 per cent to 10.8% over the same period,"" it said.In fact, Ecowrap added that the trends in GCF to gross output ratio or the plough back of funds for creation of fresh capacity shows that for public administration the ratio attained fresh peak in 2021-22 owing to the emphasis on capital expenditure in recent budgets.At the aggregate level, gross capital formation is supposed to have crossed 32% in 2022-23, the highest level since 2018-19.According to the report, in 2021-22, gross savings have risen to 30% from 29% in 2020-21.""The ratio is supposed to have crossed 31 per cent in 2022-23, the highest since 2018-19. The household savings increased sharply during the pandemic period on account of sharp accretion in financial savings such as deposits,"" said the report by SBI's Economic Research Department.While household financial savings have since then moderated from 15.4% in 2020-21 to 11.1% in 2022-23, savings in physical assets have grown sharply to 11.8% in 2021-22 from 10.7% in 2020-21.The report further analysed Incremental Capital Output ratio (ICOR) -- which measures additional units of capital (investment) needed to produce additional units of output. It said that the ratio has been improving.""ICOR which was 7.5 in FY 12 is now only 3.5 in FY22. Clearly, only half of capital is now needed for next unit of output,"" the report noted.Such reducing ICOR in the current years reflects a relatively increasing efficiency of capital and shows that the economy is on a sound footing, the report said.""From that point of view, future GDP growth rates even at 7% could still mean a decent number by any standards!,"" it added.","India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.

An employee is entitled for a 50 per cent amount of the last drawn salary as pension.OPS was discontinued by the NDA government in 2003 with effect from April 1, 2004.Under the new pension scheme (NPS), employees contribute 10 per cent of their basic salary towards pension while the government contributes 14 per cent.Governments of Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand have informed the central government/ Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA about their decision to restart OPS for their employees.The government of Punjab on November 18, 2022, issued a notification regarding implementation of OPS for the state government employees who are being covered under NPS. Jharkhand too has decided to revert to OPS.",Former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan has expressed his concern over the decision of some states to restart the old pension scheme.

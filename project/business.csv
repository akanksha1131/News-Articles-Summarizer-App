According to Bajaj Broking Research, Sterling and Wilson Renewable Energy, and Prince Pipes and Fittings are the top stock picks for today. Here’s its view on Nifty, Bank Nifty and the top stock picks for June 13, 2025:

Index View: Nifty

NIFTY BANK

Bank Nifty post breakdown above the recent 5 weeks broader consolidation range (56,000-53,500) on last Friday has rallied to a fresh all time high of 57049 on Monday’s session. However, profit booking at higher levels saw the index gave up its gains and closed Thursday session around 56082 levels.

The index is currently trading above its short- and long-term moving averages signaling overall positive bias.

The last four sessions profit booking have helped the index to cool off the overbought condition. We expect the index to hold above the support area of 55,200-55,500 and head higher towards 57,000 and 57,700 levels in the coming weeks.

Stock market recommendations:Nifty traded in a 170 points range in the first three sessions of the current week. However, sharp decline in Thursday's session saw the index breach the 25,000 levels on the weekly expiry session and closed at 24888 levels.The Nifty has strong support in the range of 24,600–24,700 zone, which coincides with the confluence of the 20-day EMA and the rising trendline connecting the previous two significant swing lows. Sustaining above this support band would likely set the stage for a continuation of the uptrend towards immediate resistance levels at 25,300 and 25,500 in the near term.Importantly, the index has posted an impressive 16% rally from its April lows. Following this, it underwent a healthy consolidation phase with a mild 3% retracement before resuming its upward trajectory. This pattern of extended rallies followed by shallow corrections is characteristic of a structurally strong bull market, suggesting the potential for further upside. Any intermediate dips from current levels should be viewed as incremental buying opportunities.Market internals continue to exhibit strength, particularly in the broader indices. Outperformance is evident in the relative strength ratio of the Nifty 500 versus the Nifty 100, which has been on a steady upward trajectory. Furthermore, market breadth remains robust, with approximately 62% of stocks within the Nifty Midcap 100 and Nifty Small cap 100 trading above their 200-day Simple Moving Averages—a technical indicator that bodes well for the sustainability and depth of the ongoing uptrend.The stock is seen breaking above the last two months consolidation pattern with strong volume signaling resumption of up move and offers fresh entry opportunity.The daily 14 periods RSI is in up trend and is seen sustaining above its nine periods average thus validating positive bias. We expect the stock to head towards 363 levels being the 138.2% external retracement of the previous decline (333-244).The stock has recently generated a breakout above a bullish Flag pattern signaling continuation of the up move and offers fresh entry opportunity.The daily MACD is in uptrend and is seen sustaining above its nine periods average signaling positive bias. We expect the stock to head towards 383 levels in the coming weeks being the presence of the 200 days EMA.","According to Bajaj Broking Research, Sterling and Wilson Renewable Energy, and Prince Pipes and Fittings are the top stock picks for today.

Paytm stock price today: One 97 Communications shares crash 10% on FinMin's statement on UPI transactions,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/paytm-stock-price-today-paytm-shares-crash-10-after-finance-ministry-dismisses-mdr-on-upi-transactions/articleshow/121794025.cms,"NEW DELHI: Paytm on Thursday tumbled as much as 10% on Thursday hitting an intraday low of Rs 864.40 on BSE Sensex, after the finance ministry clarified that there are no plans to introduce a Merchant Discount Rate (MDR) on UPI transactions.As of 10 am, Paytm was trading 6% lower, underperforming the broader NSE Nifty 50, which was down just 0.14%. This marks Paytm's steepest single-day drop since February 2024, as investor sentiment took a hit following the official denial.The sharp fall in the stock price of One 97 Communications, Paytm’s parent company, came after the finance ministry on Wednesday clarified that reports suggesting MDR charges on UPI payments were ""false, baseless, and misleading.""""Speculation and claims that the MDR will be charged on UPI transactions are completely false, baseless, and misleading. Such baseless and sensation-creating speculations cause needless uncertainty, fear and suspicion among our citizens. The Government remains fully committed to promoting digital payments via UPI,"" Finance ministry wrote on X.The clarification came after some media reports suggested the government was considering levying MDR on UPI transactions only for large merchants to support banks and payment providers.Earlier in March, the Payments Council of India (PCI), which represents over 180 digital payment firms, urged the government to reconsider the introduction of merchant discount rate (MDR) on UPI transactions and RuPay debit cards.The industry body has sought an MDR of 0.3% on UPI transactions only for large merchants and a nominal MDR on RuPay debit cards for all merchants.The council warned that without MDR, the digital payments infrastructure could become unsustainable, affecting innovation, cybersecurity, and customer support.PCI argued that the policy, in place since January 2020, has put pressure on the payment ecosystem, despite a Rs 1,500 crore government incentive that falls far short of the estimated Rs 10,000 crore needed annually. Members of PCI include major players like Amazon Pay, PhonePe, Paytm, and Razorpay.",Paytm tumbled as much as 10% on Thursday hitting an intraday low of Rs 864.40 on BSE Sensex.

Tesla's electric vehicle sales have recently dipped, hit by rising competition, the revamp of its popular Model Y, and the backlash from Musk’s political statements.The Austin launch coincides with a reported clash between Musk and US President Donald Trump over tax policy.

Gold price prediction today: MCX Gold August 2025 contract has opened with a spectacular gap up at ₹100,300, marking a massive surge of over 1,800 points from previous levels. This dramatic move is likely triggered by overnight geopolitical tensions on Israel attacks on Iran Nuclear sites. Dollar weakness at 98$, has created a new bullish paradigm for the precious metal. While the gap up presents immediate profit opportunities, seasoned traders are positioning for strategic buy-on-dips entries.The ₹99,000 level, coinciding with the 21-day EMA, represents the most logical support zone for dip buying in this new bullish environment. This level offers multiple confluence factors:1. EMA 21 Support: The 21-period moving average at ₹99,000 provides dynamic support2. Psychological Level: Round number support with strong psychological significance3. Gap Fill Protection: Sufficient distance from gap opening to avoid immediate fill4. Volume Profile: High volume acceptance above ₹99,000 during previous sessions5. Fibonacci Support: 50% retracement of recent rally from ₹97,500 to current levelsThe gap up opening in gold has created a paradigm shift from resistance-based selling to support-based buying strategies. The ₹99,000 level offers an exceptional risk-reward opportunity for traders looking to capitalize on this momentum breakout. However, the elevated volatility demands disciplined execution and strict adherence to risk management protocols.The technical setup strongly favors buyers on any weakness, with multiple confluence factors supporting the ₹99,000 zone.

'Trump Card is coming': $5m gold card offering US residency now accepting applications; key details,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/trump-card-is-coming-5m-gold-card-offering-us-residency-now-accepting-applications-key-details/articleshow/121790287.cms,"(Source: Donald Trump's Truth Social account)

The

Trump Card

is coming!

What the card promises — and what it doesn’t

A replacement for EB-5?

Major tax advantage for card holders

The much-hyped “Trump Card” is now officially open for registration, offering wealthy foreigners a chance to join a waiting list.US President Donald Trump describes it as a premium route toward US citizenship, for a hefty $5 million price tag.The official website, TrumpCard.gov, features an image of the shiny gold-coloured card, complete with Trump’s photo, signature and name. The form asks for basic details like name, email, region of origin, and whether the applicant is applying as an individual or a business.Trump announced the launch on his social media platform Truth Social, “For five million $DOLLARS, The Trump Card is coming! Thousands have been calling and asking how they can sign up to ride a beautiful road in gaining access to the greatest country and market anywhere in the world.”“The waiting list is now open,” he added.The website lists eight regions for applicants to choose from: Europe, Asia (including the Middle East), North America, Oceania, Central America, South America, the Caribbean and Africa.Above the details, the site ensures that applicants will be notified when access opens: ‘Enter your information below to be notified the moment access opens.’Trump claims the card offers a “path to citizenship,” but he has clarified that it does not guarantee immediate entry or naturalisation. “It’s somewhat like a green card , but at a higher level of sophistication,” the POTUS has claimed.The Trump administration insists the new card does not require approval from Congress, as it doesn’t provide citizenship outright. White House officials have said more information will be released soon, reports USA Today.Under the existing US naturalisation system, immigrants must typically be lawful permanent residents for at least five years, meet age and language criteria, and have a clean record.Trump first proposed the Trump Card earlier this year as a replacement for the EB-5 investor visa programme, which grants green cards to foreigners who invest between $800,000 and $1.05 million into US job-creating projects. The EB-5 programme has long suffered from backlogs and accusations of fraud.“Wealthy people will be coming into our country by buying this card,” Trump said in February. “They'll be wealthy, and they'll be successful, and they'll be spending a lot of money, and paying a lot of taxes and employing a lot of people.”He added, “It’s a road to citizenship for people and essentially people of wealth or people of great talent where people of wealth pay for those people of talent to get in.”One of the key selling points of the Trump Card appears to be its potential tax benefits. Trump has suggested that gold card buyers would only be taxed on their US earnings, unlike green card holders, who are taxed on worldwide income. This is likely to appeal to many high-net-worth individuals who have avoided relocating to the US due to its global tax obligations.Trump Card does not seem to require applicants to create US-based jobs or launch businesses, unlike the EB-5 visa programme. US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick has claimed that 1,000 cards were sold in a single day, even though the programme has yet to officially launch. According to Lutnick, some 37 million people worldwide could afford the Trump Card.Trump has claimed he was the first to purchase the Trump Card himself. “I had no idea who would be the second,” he said. However, the programme is not designed for American citizens.","The much-hyped ‘Trump Card’ is now officially open for registration.

Stock market crash today: Nifty50 and BSE Sensex , the Indian equity benchmark indices, tanked in trade on Friday on global cues. While Nifty50 crashed below 24,550, BSE Sensex tumbled over 1,100 points intraday. Nifty50 ended the day at 24,718.60, down 170 points or 0.68%. BSE Sensex closed at 81,118.60, down 573 points or 0.70%.Stock market indices Nifty and Sensex declined influenced by subdued global markets and increased Brent crude oil prices following Israel's strike on Iran's capital, affecting investor confidence.Investors demonstrated caution towards higher-risk investments, concerned about potential escalation between Israel and Iran, alongside foreign fund withdrawals.Within the Sensex portfolio, significant declines were observed in Adani Ports, ITC, State Bank of India, IndusInd Bank, HDFC Bank, Titan, Kotak Mahindra Bank and UltraTech Cement.Conversely, Tech Mahindra, Tata Consultancy Services, Sun Pharma and Maruti showed positive performance.The international oil benchmark Brent crude increased by 7.44 per cent to USD 74.52 per barrel.""Indian equity benchmarks experienced downward pressure, driven by weak global cues and foreign institutional outflows.Market sentiment was notably impacted by heightened geopolitical tensions following Israel's military strike on Iran, which significantly increased risk aversion among investors. Although India's CPI for May eased below the RBI's comfort threshold, offering a positive macro signal, this was largely overshadowed by external headwinds.""Brent crude prices climbed to near USD 76/barrel, their highest this year, raising fears of inflation if tensions persist,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Investments Limited, said.According to exchange data, Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) sold equities worth Rs 3,831.42 crore on Thursday.The market downturn was initiated by Israel's military operation against Iran early Friday. Israel reported targeting nuclear installations, missile production facilities, and military leadership in what they termed a ""preemptive strike"" against Tehran's nuclear weapons development.Israel declared a state of emergency, anticipating potential missile and drone counterattacks.Iranian state media confirmed Hossein Salami's death, who served as Commander of Iran's Revolutionary Guards. Israeli sources indicated that several high-ranking Iranian military officials and nuclear researchers were likely casualties.US Secretary of State Marco Rubio described the operation as a ""unilateral action"" by Israel, stating that the United States was not involved.This development occurs as nuclear negotiations remain unresolved, with the sixth round of US-Iran talks scheduled in Oman on Sunday. Dr. VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Investments Limited, stated, ""The economic consequences of this Israeli strike can be profound if the attack and counterattack by Iran lingers long.""Brent crude futures rose by $6.29 (9.07%) to $75.65 per barrel at 03:15 GMT, reaching $78.50, its highest since January 27.US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude increased by $6.43 (9.45%) to $74.47 per barrel, touching $77.62, the peak since January 21.Both benchmarks recorded their most significant intraday gains since 2022, following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which caused energy prices to rise substantially.""Israel has declared that the operation will last several days. Brent crude prices have flared up by around 12% to $78. It can rise further if Iran, in retaliation, closes the straight of Hormuz, severely restricting oil supply,"" Vijayakumar said.The situation in the Middle East, a crucial oil-producing area, introduced additional uncertainty to global markets, which were already affected by US President Donald Trump's inconsistent trade policies.The MSCI Asia ex-Japan index decreased by 1.1%. US S&P E-mini futures fell 1.7%, Nasdaq futures declined 1.8%, and Europe's STOXX 50 futures reduced by 1.6%.Key Asian markets showed significant drops: Japan's Nikkei decreased 1.3%, South Korea's KOSPI fell 1.1%, and Hong Kong's Hang Seng declined 0.8%.Heightened market caution drove investors towards secure investments. The benchmark US 10-year Treasury yields declined to 4.31%, reaching their lowest point in a month.The Swiss franc strengthened by 0.4% to 0.8072 against the dollar, whilst the Japanese yen advanced 0.3% to 143.12.

Nippon Steel–US Steel deal approved: Trump signs executive order; contingent on compliance with security agreement,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/nippon-steelus-steel-deal-approved-trump-signs-executive-order-contingent-on-compliance-with-security-agreement/articleshow/121841927.cms,"Image used for representative purposes

US President Donald Trump has signed an executive order enabling Japanese firm Nippon Steel's investment in US Steel, contingent upon compliance with a government-mandated ""national security agreement"".The joint statement from both companies confirms $11 billion in new investments by 2028 and the provision of a ""golden share"" to the US government, ensuring protection of national security interests regarding steel production. They expressed gratitude to Trump's administration, highlighting the partnership's significance for American manufacturing.Following completion of regulatory approvals and Department of Justice review, the partnership awaits prompt finalisation. US Steel shares increased by $2.66 to $54.85 in Friday's afterhours trading, compared to Nippon Steel's initial bid of $55 per share in late 2023.The acquisition concludes the long-time uncertainty regarding international control of a crucial state resource that started when US Steel and Nippon Steel disclosed their intentions for a $14.9 billion merger in December 2023.Details regarding the golden share mechanism, national security agreement provisions and investment allocation remain limited.White House spokesman Kush Desai emphasised the order's role in maintaining US Steel's presence in Pennsylvania. Legal expert James Brower noted that such agreements typically remain confidential, particularly from the government's perspective.The transaction, originally valued at nearly $15 billion, faced delays due to national security concerns during Biden's presidency. American officials now value it at $28 billion, including the purchase bid and plans for a new electric arc furnace post-2028, reported AP.Nippon Steel committed to maintaining Pittsburgh headquarters, establishing an American-majority board, protecting plant operations and trade interests, while avoiding steel slab imports that would compete with US blast furnaces.Trump, initially opposing the purchase, later showed willingness to negotiate. He claimed ""total control"" through the golden share, though Nippon Steel maintains its intention for full ownership.The order acknowledges potential national security risks but suggests adequate mitigation through the security agreement. The Treasury Department and CFIUS agencies must approve the agreement's execution by the transaction's closing date, with Trump retaining authority for further actions.","US President Donald Trump has signed an executive order enabling Japanese firm Nippon Steel's investment in US Steel.

"Oil prices, freight rates may pinch economy",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/oil-prices-freight-rates-may-pinch-economy/articleshow/121841491.cms,"Representative photo

NEW DELHI: The fresh conflict in West Asia can have a spillover effect on India just when inflation was moderating and businesses were learning to cope with the unpredictability of Trump’s tariffs. While the direct impact of Israel’s attack on Iran will be limited, given that India has very little trade left with the Islamic nation, the indirect fallout can be significant.The biggest concern will be the implication of higher oil prices on the Indian economy. While oil companies have not passed on the gains of cheaper crude to consumers, they have been pocketing the large gains and passing on a part of it to govt in the form of higher dividends. The tension, if it persists, could prove to be a party pooper for state-run petro retailers as well as the Centre. In unregulated segments such as ATF, consumers may have to bear the burden of higher crude prices.There may be spillover into certain commodities such as saffron, where Iran is a large producer, and any disruption results in a price spike. However, it is unlikely to have much implication on the household budget.The indirect impact may be bigger. Exporters fear disruption of sea routes, higher freight costs, and are keeping tabs on crude prices.“The major concern is regarding disruption of trade routes: Red Sea and Suez Canal, which are vital for our exports to Europe, US, Africa, and West Asia. Freight rates are likely to go up and overall logistics cost. Uncertainty will hit at the demand,” said Ajay Sahay, director general at Fieo.Freight rates have already firmed up following a temporary truce between the US and China. Drewry’s WCI increased 59% during the last four weeks, as Trump’s “pause” on import tariffs led to the resumption of US-bound traffic. Freight rates from Shanghai to New York rose 2% to $7,285 per 40ft container in the past week and 67% since May 15 (four weeks ago), while spot rates to Los Angeles increased 1% in the past week and 89% in the past four weeks. Prices on the Transpacific eastbound route changed marginally amid the fresh injection of capacity, the agency said.Besides, higher prices of commodities such as gold — a favoured investment option for Indian households — will push up the import bill and widen the trade deficit. But it is still early days and over the last few years, the world has managed to live with conflicts.","The direct impact of Israel’s attack on Iran will be limited, given that India has very little trade left with the Islamic nation.

Crypto investments under scanner: CBDT launches probe into unaccounted income; high-risk investors in VDA may face scrutiny,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/crypto-investments-under-scanner-cbdt-launches-probe-into-unaccounted-income-high-risk-investors-in-vda-may-face-scrutiny/articleshow/121835795.cms,"The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has launched a probe into possible tax evasion and laundering of unaccounted income through investments in virtual digital assets (VDAs), including high-risk VDA transactions and cryptocurrencies, sources in the government said on Thursday.The tax authority is currently verifying individuals and entities engaged in high-risk VDA transactions who appear to have failed to comply with key provisions of the Income Tax Act, 1961, PTI reported. These include non-disclosure of digital asset income and incorrect tax filings, according to officials familiar with the matter.Under Section 115BBH of the Income Tax Act, introduced in the Finance Act, 2022, income from the transfer of VDAs is taxed at a flat rate of 30%, plus applicable surcharge and cess. The law prohibits deduction of any expenses except for the cost of acquisition and also disallows the set-off or carry-forward of losses from VDA transactions.Government data analytics has revealed widespread non-compliance, with a significant number of taxpayers either failing to report digital asset gains in the designated Schedule VDA of their income tax returns (ITR), or paying tax at lower rates while incorrectly claiming benefits such as cost indexation.CBDT has matched ITR filings with TDS data submitted by Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs), commonly known as crypto exchanges, and discrepancies have triggered a wider scrutiny, officials said. Taxpayers found defaulting could be subject to further verification or scrutiny under the law.In recent weeks, the board has sent emails to thousands of individuals identified as high-risk defaulters, urging them to review and, if necessary, update their ITRs to accurately reflect income from VDA transactions.The development comes under the CBDT’s ongoing push to promote voluntary compliance through its “NUDGE” framework — short for Non-intrusive Usage of Data to Guide and Enable taxpayers — under its “Trust Taxpayers First” philosophy.This is the third NUDGE campaign initiated by the department in the past six months, following previous efforts focused on foreign asset disclosures and withdrawal of ineligible deductions claimed under section 80GGC.",The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has launched a probe into possible tax evasion and laundering of unaccounted income through investments in virtual digital assets (VDAs) The tax authority is currently verifying individuals and entities engaged in high-risk VDA transactions.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121835808,imgsize-1213173,width-400,resizemode-4/121835808.jpg"

Oil companies brace for hit on margins but see no supply disruption from Israel-Iran conflict,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/oil-companies-brace-for-hit-on-margins-but-see-no-supply-disruption-from-israel-iran-conflict/articleshow/121835184.cms,"NEW DELHI: Downstream oil companies are bracing for a hit on their margins but do not see much chance of major supply disruption after crude spiked 9% on Friday following the breakout of military conflict between Israel and Iran.Benchmark Brent crude jumped to $78.50/barrel but settled at $75.55, or $6.19 higher than the previous close, marking the widest intra-day movement since Russia's February 24, 2022 invasion of Ukraine when the price had hit $105.Oil minister Hardeep Puri assured ""adequate energy supplies for the coming months"" after reviewing the situation with petroleum secretary Pankaj Jain and heads of state-run refining and fuel retailing companies, which meet 90% of the domestic fuel needs.India’s energy strategy is shaped by successfully navigating the trilemma of energy availability, affordability and sustainability under the dynamic leadership of PM Narendra Modi, he said on X after the meeting.India's oil consumption is pegged at 4.5-5 million barrels per day. The country has an emergency reserve of 5 million tonnes, or almost 37 million barrels. In addition, oil companies store 40-45 days of crude, while large quantities remain seaborne in transit.Refiners also store fuel at their plants and depots across the country.But the country also depends on imports to meet over 80% of its oil and 50% gas consumption. Half of this comes from the Gulf through the Hormuz Strait, the chokepoint through which a fifth of global seaborne oil trade goes through.""India doesn't buy any oil from Iran. So there's no worry on that count. As far as blocking Hormuz Strait is concerned, it is extremely unlikely. It has never happened before, even during the earlier wars in the region. Blocking Hormuz will draw in the others in the region as outward cargos of oil and in-bound refined product shipments will stop. Iran itself will suffer,"" a senior executive of an oil company said on condition of anonymity.A statement from the Iranian government said no damage was caused to National Iranian Oil Refining and Distribution Company's refineries and fuel depots, which continue to function normally.The real worry, an executive of another company said, is a reduction in profitability. ""We are sure to end up taking a hit on profitability as under-recoveries return if oil remains elevated for an extended period,"" the executive said.Others, however, said the market has already factored in the risk as seen from the fact that prices fell from their intra-day peak. But all agree that insurance costs will head north due to higher risk premia and vessels avoiding the route.""Iran may not block Hormuz. But Teheran-backed rebels could target vessels. Even in such cases, interruptions of a cargo or two can easily be bridged from elsewhere as India has a diversified pallate ,"" the first executive quoted above said.Industry sources said the retailers' margins on petrol and diesel currently stand in single digits. But they are incurring under-recovery of Rs 160-170 on domestic LPG. Even LNG will become costlier if oil prices remain high as most of India's gas contracts are benchmarked to Brent.","Crude spiked 9% on Friday following the breakout of military conflict between Israel and Iran.

Similarly, the Model X AWD now costs $89,990, and the Model X Plaid is listed at $104,990, Reuters reported.Earlier, Elon Musk announced Tuesday that Tesla is ""tentatively"" launching its long-anticipated robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, on June 22. The move marks a significant leap in Tesla’s autonomous driving ambitions, with Musk emphasizing a cautious approach: “We are being super paranoid about safety, so the date could shift,” he said in a post on social media platform X.Musk also noted that the first Tesla to fully self-drive from the end of the production line to a customer’s home is scheduled for June 28—an industry-first if achieved.The vehicles involved in the rollout are reportedly unmodified Tesla Model Ys, built with the Full Self-Driving (FSD) software pre-installed and capable of operating without human intervention.A recent video circulating online showed a Model Y in Austin, branded with a “Robotaxi” logo, transporting a passenger without a driver onboard. Musk confirmed the footage, stating that ""every Tesla coming out of our factories is capable of unsupervised self-driving. ""This announcement brings Tesla closer to fulfilling a promise Musk has been making for years—commercializing fully autonomous vehicles.

"US consumer sentiment jumps for first time in 2025, says UMich report; tariff pause and steady prices lift confidence",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-consumer-sentiment-jumps-for-first-time-in-2025-says-umich-report-tariff-pause-and-steady-prices-lift-confidence/articleshow/121832924.cms,"US consumer sentiment improved in June for the first time in six months, according to preliminary data released Friday by the University of Michigan, offering signs of economic stabilization as inflation remains subdued and trade tensions with China temporarily ease.The university’s closely watched Consumer Sentiment Index jumped to 60.5 in June from 52.2 in May — a 16% rise that marks the sharpest increase in a year. The rebound follows five consecutive monthly declines and lifts the index from its second-lowest level in the survey’s nearly 75-year history. Despite the uptick, sentiment remains down 20% compared with December 2024.""Consumers appear to have settled somewhat from the shock of the extremely high tariffs announced in April and the policy volatility seen in the weeks that followed,” said Joanne Hsu, director of the survey, AP reported. “However, consumers still perceive wide-ranging downside risks to the economy.”The improvement comes after President Donald Trump postponed a sweeping round of tariffs on imports from roughly 60 countries in April and subsequently reached a truce with China last month. While tariffs remain elevated by historical standards, the White House has signaled a willingness to pause escalation pending further talks.The Conference Board’s Consumer Confidence Index — a separate metric released late last month — also showed improvement after five straight monthly declines, with analysts attributing the shift to easing fears over inflation and trade policy unpredictability.Official inflation data released earlier this week showed consumer prices rising 2.4% year-on-year in May, up slightly from 2.3% in April. While tariffs are expected to put further pressure on prices in the second half of the year, inflation remains close to the Federal Reserve’s 2% target for now.Sentiment remains sharply divided along political lines. Republicans, who broadly support Trump’s economic policies, continue to express stronger confidence than Democrats, whose views had been more optimistic under the Biden administration. However, sentiment improved across party lines in June, including among independents.Inflation expectations among consumers also declined in June — a development likely to be welcomed by the Federal Reserve ahead of its policy meeting next week. Economists view such expectations as a key variable in inflation dynamics, as fears of rising prices can influence wage demands and spending behavior.The Fed is widely expected to leave its benchmark short-term interest rate unchanged at approximately 4.3% when it meets next week, as policymakers monitor the evolving impact of trade policy and inflationary risks on the broader economy.",The University of Michigan's Consumer Sentiment Index jumped to 60.5 in June from 52.2 in May.

Oil prices jumped nearly 8%, intensifying worries about supply constraints and their potential impact on the economy.The 10-year Treasury yield ticked higher to 4.385%, reflecting ongoing shifts in interest rate expectations. Currency markets also saw the dollar strengthen against the euro, signaling increased demand for US assets.Shares of oil companies like Chevron and oil services players such as Halliburton rallied as oil prices surged about eight percent following the Israeli strike, AFP reported.Meanwhile, Brazilian meat giant JBS shares fell 6% in early trading Friday as the company made its long-awaited debut on the New York Stock Exchange, AP reported.The listing marks a major milestone for JBS, which was founded 72 years ago and has grown into one of the world’s largest meat producers. The US is a critical market for the company, accounting for roughly half of its annual revenue and employing over 72,000 people. JBS is currently the largest beef producer in the US and ranks second in poultry and pork production.Global oil prices spiked sharply on Friday, triggering broader market volatility as escalating geopolitical tensions in the Middle East rattled investor sentiment and raised concerns over potential supply disruptions.US benchmark crude surged 7.1% to $72.88 per barrel, while Brent crude, the global benchmark, climbed 7.2% to $74.32. The gains came after Israel launched a pre-emptive military strike on Iranian facilities, stoking fears of a wider regional conflict that could curtail Iranian oil exports and keep energy prices elevated worldwide.Although Iran remains a major oil producer, ongoing Western sanctions have already limited its sales. Analysts at S&P Global Commodity Insights noted that past flare-ups between Iran and Israel have often led to brief spikes in oil prices, followed by reversals once the immediate threat of escalation passed. “This is an economic shock that nobody really needs, but it is one that seems more like a shock to sentiment than to the fundamentals of the economy,” said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management as quoted AP.United Airlines dropped 5.2%, Delta Air Lines fell 4.5%, and Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings slipped 2.9% as investors grew concerned about higher fuel costs and potential disruptions to travel demand. Adobe tumbled 5.7% despite beating Wall Street profit expectations, as analysts said investors were unimpressed with the company's forward guidance.In contrast, energy and defense stocks rallied. Exxon Mobil rose 2.2% and ConocoPhillips added 2.3%, supported by the oil rally. Defense contractors also gained, with Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman both up 2.3%, reflecting market anticipation of increased global defense spending.Gold climbed 1.8% to $3,463.70 per ounce, as risk-averse investors sought safety amid the geopolitical turmoil. However, Treasury prices fell, pushing yields higher, with the 10-year note edging up to 4.38% from 4.36%. The decline in bond prices, despite risk-off sentiment, reflected market fears that sustained high oil prices could reaccelerate inflation and constrain the Federal Reserve’s ability to cut interest rates later this year.Recent inflation data has shown moderation, but Trump’s sweeping tariffs and now the oil shock are seen as potential triggers for renewed price pressures. The Fed has maintained a cautious stance, holding rates steady this year after three cuts in 2024, as it monitors the twin risks of inflation and slowing growth.Overseas, market sentiment was similarly negative. Germany’s DAX fell 1.4%, and France’s CAC 40 dropped 1.1%, amid a broad retreat across European and Asian equity markets.","The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped over 480 points, down 1.12%, while the Nasdaq and S&P 500 also slipped.

US stock indexes were mostly flat on Thursday afternoon as investors processed another encouraging report on inflation. The S&P 500 edged 0.2% higher, bringing it within 2% of its all-time high. The Nasdaq composite also rose 0.2%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped by 13 points, or less than 0.1%, as of 12:23 p.m. Eastern time.Oracle provided a boost to the markets, surging 14.4% after the tech company reported stronger-than-expected quarterly profits and revenue.

The aircraft went down in a residential area five minutes after departure. The cause of the crash has not yet been determined.Markets also drew support from easing Treasury yields, following the latest inflation data. Thursday’s report showed that wholesale-level inflation in May was lower than economists had anticipated.That followed Wednesday’s release indicating consumer inflation was also milder than expected.Investors viewed the data as a potential signal that the Federal Reserve could have more flexibility to reduce interest rates later in the year to support the economy. The Fed has so far held off on additional cuts in 2025, citing uncertainty over how President Donald Trump’s tariffs might affect both inflation and economic growth.Although lower interest rates tend to stimulate economic activity by making borrowing cheaper, they can also risk pushing inflation higher. The 10-year Treasury yield declined to 4.36% on Thursday, down from 4.41% late Wednesday and from around 4.80% earlier this year.Another report, showing jobless claims ticked up slightly last week and remained at their highest level in eight months, also contributed to the decline in yields. Economists had expected a lower number of claims.“We believe that were it not for the uncertainty caused by the tariffs, the combined information coming from the inflation and labor-market data would have compelled the Fed to have resumed cutting its policy rate by now,” said Thierry Wizman, strategist at Macquarie, as quoted PTI.The Federal Reserve is scheduled to hold its next policy meeting next week, and markets widely expect it will leave interest rates unchanged. However, traders are betting the first rate cut could come in September, according to CME Group data.Trump’s tariff policies have weighed heavily on market sentiment over the past several months. At one point, concerns over inflation and a potential recession pushed the S&P 500 down by nearly 20% from its peak. Since then, equities have rebounded significantly amid hopes that Trump might ease tariffs through new trade agreements.Still, uncertainty persists. Late Wednesday, Trump reignited concerns by suggesting the US could issue ultimatums to foreign governments: “saying this is the deal. You can take it or you can leave it.”Globally, stock market performances were mixed on Thursday. Most European and Asian indexes saw modest changes. However, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index dropped 1.4%, reversing part of its recent rally. Despite the decline, the index remains up nearly 20% for the year—well ahead of the S&P 500’s year-to-date gain of under 3%.","The S&P 500 edged 0.2% higher, bringing it within 2% of its all-time high. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped by 13 points, or less than 0.1%, as of 12:23 p.m. Eastern time.Oracle surged 14.4% after the tech company reported stronger-than-expected quarterly profits.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121806513,imgsize-1180763,width-400,resizemode-4/121806513.jpg"
"US producer prices holds at 2.6% in May; wholesale prices rose 0.1% from April, Fed seen staying cautious on rate cuts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-producer-prices-holds-at-2-6-in-may-wholesale-prices-rose-0-1-from-april-fed-seen-staying-cautious-on-rate-cuts/articleshow/121805636.cms,"US producer prices rose modestly in May, offering further evidence that inflationary pressures remain subdued even as tariffs continue to loom over global trade, according to data released by the Labor Department on Thursday.The Producer Price Index (PPI), which tracks inflation at the wholesale level before it reaches consumers, rose 2.6% in May from a year earlier. On a monthly basis, prices increased just 0.1% after a 0.2% decline in April. Both readings came in slightly below economists' expectations, AP reported.Excluding the often-volatile categories of food and energy, so-called core wholesale prices rose 0.1% from April and 3% from a year earlier.Energy prices were flat overall, although gasoline rose 1.6% following a decline the previous month. Food prices at the wholesale level edged up 0.1%, while egg prices — which had dropped a sharp 39.3% in April — rebounded by 1.4% in May. Egg prices remain 125% higher compared to May 2024, largely due to supply disruptions from the bird flu outbreak.The PPI data came a day after the Consumer Price Index showed a similar trend, with consumer inflation rising just 0.1% month-on-month and 2.4% year-on-year in May.Despite US President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariff policy — which includes a 10% baseline levy on nearly all imports and targeted duties on steel, aluminum, and autos — inflation has yet to show a broad-based resurgence. Economists caution, however, that the full effects of the tariffs may emerge later in the year as supply chains adjust and importers pass on higher costs.The PPI is closely watched because some of its components, such as health care and financial services, are factored into the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge, the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index.Inflation surged in 2021 as the economy rebounded sharply from pandemic-era lockdowns, prompting the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates 11 times in 2022 and 2023. Those aggressive hikes helped tame inflation from its 2022 peak, allowing the Fed to cut rates three times last year.However, the Fed has adopted a more cautious stance in 2025 amid uncertainty over the inflationary effects of recent trade measures. The central bank is widely expected to keep its benchmark rate unchanged at next week’s policy meeting.","Producer Price Index (PPI), which tracks inflation at the wholesale level before it reaches consumers, rose 2.6% in May from a year earlier.

"UK GDP shrinks 0.3% in April; Trump’s duties and tax expiry hit growth, exports to US plunge by record £2 billion",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/uk-gdp-shrinks-0-3-in-april-trumps-duties-and-tax-expiry-hit-growth-exports-to-us-plunge-by-record-2-billion/articleshow/121804829.cms,"Britain’s economy contracted 0.3% in April, the steepest monthly decline since October 2023, as US President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs and the expiry of a property tax break combined to derail output, official data showed on Thursday.The contraction was sharper than the 0.1% drop forecast in a Reuters poll and followed modest 0.2% growth in March. The blow to GDP came mainly from the services sector, which shrank by 0.4%, led by a slump in real estate and legal activity following the end of a temporary property transaction tax break. That alone accounted for two-thirds of the GDP decline.Exports to the US fell by £2 billion in April — the largest monthly drop on record — as Trump’s tariffs on global imports, including a 10% levy on goods and higher rates on aluminium and steel, began to bite. Britain remains the only major economy with a bilateral trade deal aimed at shielding it from some of these duties, but core tariffs remain in place, Reuters reported.""The GDP numbers are clearly disappointing,"" UK Finance Minister Rachel Reeves said, just a day after announcing a multi-year public spending review worth over £2 trillion.Economists cited not just the tariff shock but also domestic fiscal tightening and the delayed effects of past interest rate hikes as factors behind the slowdown.“Looking through the noise and data quality issues, we expect the underlying pace of growth to remain underwhelming,” said Matt Swannell of the EY ITEM Club.Despite a strong Q1 performance — with 0.7% growth, the highest among G7 economies — the Bank of England last month lowered its 2026 growth forecast to 1.25%, projecting that the US tariff regime would reduce UK output by 0.3% over the next three years.The weak April data complicates the BoE’s monetary policy outlook. While a rate cut is unlikely at next week’s meeting due to persistent inflation concerns, many economists now expect the central bank to ease policy in August.“The door is probably closed on a cut next week, but these downbeat figures increase the likelihood of a policy loosening later this summer,” said Suren Thiru, economics director at ICAEW.Sterling fell nearly half a cent against the dollar after the data release, and government bond yields slipped to a one-month low.Among major sectors, construction was the only bright spot, growing 0.9% in April. Industrial production fell 0.6%, with manufacturing down 0.9%.The Office for National Statistics (ONS) also reported that the UK’s goods trade deficit widened to £23.2 billion in April from £19.9 billion in March, exceeding expectations.Analysts remain cautious about the path forward. “The drag from US trade policy has added to a range of domestic headwinds,” said Swannell, warning that the seasonal volatility seen since the pandemic may continue to skew month-to-month GDP readings.","Britain's economy contracted 0.3% in April, the steepest monthly decline since October 2023.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor ( CEA ) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran Udaan until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.Udaan built an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business still accounts for a very small part of India’s overall retail market but can balloon to $150 billion in sales and yield a 100% return on capital invested in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co. estimates published in the Mint newspaper.Bengaluru-based Udaan has also ventured into financing through its fintech unit which helps shopkeepers get working capital loans to buy inventory. That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says.

How India's GDP has been growing

What SBI report said on savings and investment

Incremental capital output ratio

NEW DELHI: India's gross domestic product (GDP) data for the third quarter (October-December 2022) received a word of caution from the former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan In an interview with news agency PTI, Rajan that India is ""dangerously close"" to the Hindu rate of growth in view of subdued private sector investment, high interest rates and slowing global growth.India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying"".However, a report released by the State Bank of India (SBI) economists on Tuesday dismissed arguments that India is dangerously close to Hindu rate of growth saying such statements are ""ill-conceived, biased and premature"".The term 'Hindu growth rate' was coined by late economist Raj Krishna in 1978 to describe the slow growth in the country.It basically refers to the low pace of economic growth rates during 1950s to 1980s. During this period, the Indian economy averaged 3.5%.A former lecturer at the Delhi School of Economics (DSE), Krishna noted that only if the rate of growth is persistently slow and accompanied by low per-capita GDP, then it will be known as Hindu rate of growth but it has to factor in population growth as well.Before economic reforms of 1991, India's economic growth remained stagnant and low, while per capita income averaged around 1.3%. Krishna termed this low growth situation to be a result of socialist policies of state control and import substitution.However, the economic situation changed when liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation (LPG) reforms came into effect in the year 1991, at a time when India faced balance of payment crisis.Over the years, many economists have strongly opposed the idea of 'Hindu growth rate' and the term never had universal acceptance.The Indian economy plunged into its very first technical recession in FY21 due to the impact of Covid-19 pandemic and the related nationwide lockdowns. GDP shrunk by an unprecedented 23.8% in the first quarter of the financial year 2020-21. However, due to spurt in economic activities in the subsequent quarters, the GDP decline started to narrow.However, if we look at the period before Covid-19 as well, India's growth curve shows a declining trend.From 8.26% in FY17, GDP growth plunged to 3.74% in FY20. Shutdown of economic activities in FY21 in wake of Covid-19 only made matters worse.As lockdowns started to ease and business activities resumed, India's GDP also started rising. In Q1 of FY22, growth jumped to 20.1% mainly on account of low base effect. By the fourth quarter of FY22, growth came down to 4.10%.Similarly, the new financial year 2022-23 brought fresh economic challenges in the form of Russia-Ukraine war that impacted almost all major economies of the world, slowed the pace of growth, pushed inflation to record highs.As a result, the central banks of all advanced economies spurred into action and opted for monetary policy tightening to curb the soaring inflation.With persistently rising interest rates, India's economy grew by 4.4% in Q3 of FY23, as the Centre revised upwards GDP growth for previous year to 9.10% from 8.7% earlier.The report weighed recent GDP numbers against the available data on savings and investments for the past decade and highlighted some interesting points.""Quarterly growth numbers are noisy and should be best avoided for any serious interpretation (on an average, India's GDP growth has witnessed Rs 2 lakh crore upward revision for the 3 year ended FY23),"" the report said.Gross capital formation (GCF) by the government touched a high of 11.8% in 2021-22, up from 10.7% in 2020-21.""This also had a domino effect on private sector investment that jumped from 10 per cent to 10.8% over the same period,"" it said.In fact, Ecowrap added that the trends in GCF to gross output ratio or the plough back of funds for creation of fresh capacity shows that for public administration the ratio attained fresh peak in 2021-22 owing to the emphasis on capital expenditure in recent budgets.At the aggregate level, gross capital formation is supposed to have crossed 32% in 2022-23, the highest level since 2018-19.According to the report, in 2021-22, gross savings have risen to 30% from 29% in 2020-21.""The ratio is supposed to have crossed 31 per cent in 2022-23, the highest since 2018-19. The household savings increased sharply during the pandemic period on account of sharp accretion in financial savings such as deposits,"" said the report by SBI's Economic Research Department.While household financial savings have since then moderated from 15.4% in 2020-21 to 11.1% in 2022-23, savings in physical assets have grown sharply to 11.8% in 2021-22 from 10.7% in 2020-21.The report further analysed Incremental Capital Output ratio (ICOR) -- which measures additional units of capital (investment) needed to produce additional units of output. It said that the ratio has been improving.""ICOR which was 7.5 in FY 12 is now only 3.5 in FY22. Clearly, only half of capital is now needed for next unit of output,"" the report noted.Such reducing ICOR in the current years reflects a relatively increasing efficiency of capital and shows that the economy is on a sound footing, the report said.""From that point of view, future GDP growth rates even at 7% could still mean a decent number by any standards!,"" it added.","India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.

An employee is entitled for a 50 per cent amount of the last drawn salary as pension.OPS was discontinued by the NDA government in 2003 with effect from April 1, 2004.Under the new pension scheme (NPS), employees contribute 10 per cent of their basic salary towards pension while the government contributes 14 per cent.Governments of Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand have informed the central government/ Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority ( PFRDA about their decision to restart OPS for their employees.The government of Punjab on November 18, 2022, issued a notification regarding implementation of OPS for the state government employees who are being covered under NPS.

The meeting was chaired by Food Secretary Sanjeev Chopra.Out of the total wheat procurement target for the 2022-23 marketing year (April-March), Punjab will aim to procure 2.5 million tonnes wheat, Haryana 1.5 million tonnes and Madhya Pradrsh 2 million tonnes, the food ministry said in a statement.Wheat procurement had declined last year due to a fall in domestic production and higher exports.However, the government has projected a record wheat production at 112.18 million tonnes in the 2023-24 crop year (July-June) as per the second estimate of the agriculture ministry.Besides wheat, the government has also fixed rabi (winter) rice procurement target at 10.6 million tonnes in the 2022-23 marketing year.States have been advised to enhance rice milling capacity so that milling of one season gets completed before the commencement of next season and recycling of rice may be avoided.Whereas procurement of millets and coarse grains is estimated to be 7,50,000 tonnes this year, higher than 6,30,000 tonnes in 2021-22. Karnataka will procure 6,00,000 tonnes of millets this year, the statement added.Separately addressing the conference, food minister Piyush Goyal urged all state governments to implement smart-PDS at the earliest.He lauded Andhra Pradesh government's Command Control and stated that the central government will work together for implementing it in other states also.On the storage front, the Union minister said FCI is upgrading godowns into five-star rated ones and state governments can also upgrade their godowns.In the conference, all the state governments were told to learn from the best practice of using millets in schemes like mid-day meal and PDS in Karnataka, which is helpful in adding nutrition and promoting healthy diet.States were encouraged to procure more millets and coarse grains. All the state governments were asked to open procurement centres for coarse grains in producing districts, especially, in tribal areas.

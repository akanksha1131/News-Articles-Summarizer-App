Piyush Goyal Sends Strong Reply To Donald Trump, Says India Wants Fair But Balanced Trade Agreement

India-US trade deal: 3-point strategy India should adopt

End oil imports from sanctioned Russian firms. Trump has acknowledged that India has largely done this, so Step 1 is complete, says GTRI.

Secure tariff rollback before trade talks. With Russian oil imports curtailed, India should press Washington to withdraw the 25% “Russian oil” tariff. This would reduce the overall US duty burden on Indian goods from 50% to 25%, boosting competitiveness in sectors like textiles, gems and jewellery, and pharmaceuticals without rushing into a full trade deal, it says.

Resume trade negotiations after tariffs come down to 25%. Once duties are rolled back, India should restart talks for a balanced trade agreement, aiming for parity with partners like the EU and targeting average industrial tariffs of about 15%, it adds.

India-US trade deal: What’s the status?





With US President Donald Trump hinting at a trade deal soon, Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI) founder Ajay Srivastava says that India should push for rollback of 25% tariffs on account of Russian crude oil. Srivastava is of the view that before finalizing the trade deal, India should insist on America dropping the penal tariff, especially as Trump has himself claimed that India has substantially dropped its Russian crude oil trade.President Trump indicated on Monday that he plans to lower tariffs on India in the future, acknowledging that his trade policies had strained bilateral relations whilst again claiming that India has significantly reduced Russian oil imports.During the Oval Office ceremony for Sergio Gor's swearing-in as the new ambassador to India, Trump remarked, ""So right now, they don't love me, but they'll love us again."" When discussing potential trade agreements, he simply stated, ""I think we're pretty close to doing a deal that's good for everybody,"" without providing specific details about timing or remaining obstacles.GTRI proposes a 3-point approach for India: finalise withdrawal from sanctioned Russian oil trading, get the US to reverse 25% Russian oil duty to enhance market access, and subsequently engage in balanced trade discussions with the US as equals.GTRI also points out that India could potentially benefit from awaiting the US Supreme Court's verdict on Trump tariffs. Should previous rulings be upheld and the tariffs invalidated, India would be better positioned to negotiate a fair and progressive trade agreement with the US, without the constraints of unilateral duties.The US Supreme Court has commenced hearings on a significant case regarding presidential authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose such tariffs. Several justices expressed doubts about whether the legislation permits such extensive authority. A ruling against Trump would render these tariffs unlawful and require their withdrawal, potentially influencing global trade patterns and directly impacting US-India trade discussions.The trade negotiations between India and the US appear to be reaching completion, with additional discussions becoming less likely. The Indian government maintains its stance on achieving a fair outcome.At an event, Commerce & Industry Minister Piyush Goyal said, ""We are working for a good trade deal in the interest of India. We want a fair, equitable, and balanced trade deal with the US. If that happens, it could happen any day, tomorrow, next month, or next year. But as a government, we are preparing for everything.""A high-ranking official told TOI that discussions with the US have largely concluded, with no additional rounds anticipated.The official noted, ""They (the US) have to get back to us. It's the most comprehensive, WTO-compliant treaty compared to any other nation. We negotiated very cautiously, keeping in mind the sensitivities of key sectors. There is no deadline.""Following five rounds of official-level discussions, with involvement from Goyal and External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar with their American counterparts, progress appears promising.",US President Trump indicated on Monday that he plans to lower tariffs on India in the future. Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI) founder Ajay Srivastava says that India should push for rollback of 25% tariffs on account of Russian crude oil.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125266854,imgsize-60098,width-400,resizemode-4/india-us-trade-deal.jpg"

Benchmark indices ended their two-week losing streak and are trading firmly higher this week, in line with gains across global markets. Investor confidence has strengthened as the US government shutdown came to an end, with growing expectations of early Federal Reserve rate cuts amid signs of a slowdown in the U.S. job market. Additionally, India’s CPI data came in at a record low, while exit polls from the Bihar election indicating a majority for the ruling NDA further lifted sentiment. Hopes of an India–US trade deal also added to the positive momentum.Market trajectory in the upcoming week is likely to be driven by the outcome of the Bihar election, scheduled for release tomorrow, and key developments surrounding the anticipated India–U.S. trade agreement. Both factors are expected to act as major sentiment catalysts and could trigger heightened volatility across broader indices.Going forward, the broader market structure remains constructive, and we maintain a bullish bias.We recommend utilizing any corrective declines as accumulation opportunities for the next leg of the uptrend, with upside targets placed at 26,100, followed by a potential retest of the all-time high near the 26,277 zone in the coming weeks.In line with expectations, buying demand during last week emerged from the support area of 25,500-25,300. We expect the index to hold above the same being the confluence of the following technical observations.Among the oscillators, the daily 14 periods RSI has recently generated a buy signal thus supports the overall positive bias in the index.Bank Nifty continues to consolidate in the range of 57200-58600 for the fourth week in a row and is currently placed around the upper band of the range.Going ahead we expect the index to break above the upper band of the consolidation range and head towards 59,000 and 59,800 levels in the coming weeks being the measuring implication of the last 4 weeks range.On the downside, the lower band of the consolidation range at 57,300–57,100, which coincides with the recent breakout zone and the 20-day EMA, is likely to act as a strong support area.Among the oscillators, the daily 14 periods RSI has recently generated a buy signal thus supports the overall positive bias in the index.CG Power is highly optimistic, driven by structural industry tailwinds (T&D capex, railway modernization, Make in India), aggressive capacity expansion, and a strategic push into semiconductors and services. Company benefits from a diverse customer base, a strong manufacturing foundation, continuous R&D and product development, and rising export opportunities.The company faces challenges from the cyclical nature of the power business, increasing transformer supply in India, and its lack of prior experience in semiconductors. We have valued the company using the P/E valuation method, applying a 57x multiple on FY28E earnings, arriving at a target price of Rs 798.The stock is forming base around the 80% retracement of the previous major up move of October 2025 and has witnessed a shallow retracement of its previous up move signaling overall positive bias in the stock.We expect the stock to resume up move and head towards 7980 levels in the coming month being the confluence of the previous major high and key retracement of the current decline.Among the oscillators the daily stochastic has approached oversold territory and is seen rebounding from the same thus signals pullback in the coming months.","According to Bajaj Broking Research, the top stock picks for November 14, 2025 are CG Power and Industrial Solutions, and Apollo Hospitals Enterprise.

Gold price prediction today:

Gold Price Outlook

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market, other asset classes or personal finance management tips given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)





Gold price ended last week almost flat showing consolidated moves while positive developments over US Shutdown reopening over the weekend revived prospects for rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve (Fed) in December shifting focus back to deteriorating US Fiscal outlook. US private jobs data released last week indicated a weak labour market, further supporting the US rate cut prospects. US Challenger job data also indicated a spike in job cuts, suggesting a possible cooling in US labour market conditions.CME Fed funds tool showed rate cut possibility for December 10 -11 meeting have risen to above 90 % now from around 66 % yesterday. Worries about the potential economic fallout from the longest-ever US government shutdown turned out to be a key factor that continued to underpin demand for the safe-haven commodity as the yellow metal rose to three week highs in the current week.Inflation concerns also persisted as President Donald Trump floated the idea of sending American rebate checks of at least $ 2000 a person (excluding high income people) for the tariffs that his administration has collected which provided additional support to yellow metal.In other news, China central bank continued to buy gold for 12th Consecutive month as data showed China's official gold reserves stood at 74.09 MOz at the end of October up 74.06 Moz from a month earlier, which meant PBoC bought nearly one tonne which continued to boost sentiments in Gold.Meanwhile spot silver rose more than 4 % to above $50 per oz, reaching its highest since October 21. The US, which added copper, and silver to its critical minerals list, also provided structural support for precious and industrial metals. However, the supply shortage which persisted in October has likely eased now indicating an unlikely scenario for new highs in spot, but prices could still find support from uncertain economic conditions in the US which could keep safe haven flows intact in white metal.In the near term, gold is expected to test its resistance zone around $ 4190 – 4210 per oz (CMP $ 4135/Oz) while buying on dips could remain a favourable strategy for the metal. Support for the yellow metal could persist in the range of $ 4110 – 4075 per oz in near term. On MCX futures (CMP 124,850/10 gm) prices are expected to witness strong supports in the range of 1,23,800 – 1,22,900 per 10 gm levels in near term as resistance on higher side to remain at around Rs, 1,26,500 – 1,27,900 /10 gm levels for the week.Looking ahead for the week, volatility in prices could also occur at higher levels driven by fluctuations in the dollar index and global financial market as traders could closely monitor the US October Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation data later on Thursday. The headline CPI is expected to show an increase of 0.2% MoM in October, while the core CPI is projected to show a rise of 0.3% MoM during the same period. The US Retail Sales will be in the spotlight on Friday.Silver could also trade with a positive bias as a rise towards $ 52. 20 - 52.50 per oz (CMP $ 51.10/Oz) in spot cannot be ruled out in near term. Strong support could persist in the range of $ 50.20 – 49.50 /Oz levels. On MCX futures contract (CMP Rs. 1,55,500/Kg.) This could translate to a support level of Rs. 1,52,500–1,50,800 / Kg & resistance at Rs 1,58,000 - 1,59,500/Kg levels for the week.","Gold prices are expected to face upside resistance, and buying on dips may be a favourable strategy, says Maneesh Sharma, AVP - Commodities & Currencies, Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers.

Groww made a strong debut on Dalal Street on Wednesday, with shares listing on both the BSE and NSE at a premium over the issue price.Shares of Billionbrains Garage Ventures Ltd (Groww) listed at Rs 114 apiece on the BSE, marking a 14% premium over the IPO price of Rs 100. On the NSE, the stock debuted at Rs 112 per share, up 12% from the issue price.The Bengaluru-based fintech platform’s Rs 6,632 crore IPO was among the most anticipated issues of 2025, and the positive listing reflects steady investor confidence in India’s growing digital investing ecosystem.The grey market premium (GMP) for Groww IPO stood at Rs 3 per share as of Tuesday evening, down from Rs 16 on the day the issue opened, as reported by ET. The muted GMP had suggested a likely listing premium of around 4–5%, but the stock exceeded those expectations by opening 12–14% higher on debut.Analysts said the stronger-than-expected listing signals investor optimism toward fintech growth despite regulatory headwinds.As per ET, Prashanth Tapse, Sr VP Research at Mehta Equities, said, “At listing, Groww’s implied valuation appears justifiable, backed by rapid customer growth (over 10 crore users), strong brand recall in retail investing, rising market share in F&O and mutual fund distribution, and a scalable digital business model with low incremental cost.”Analysts tracking the stock remain cautiously optimistic. Raj Gaikar, Research Analyst at Samco Securities, was quoted by ET as saying, “For investors who have received allotments, we recommend holding the stock for at least 2–3 years, as we anticipate further upside over that period, given Groww’s profitability and strong revenue growth.”He noted that Groww’s valuation at 33x FY25 earnings is slightly higher than peers such as Motilal Oswal Financial Services (29x) and Angel One (31x).Prashanth Tapse of Mehta Equities also advised investors to stay invested, saying, “Those allotted shares should hold through listing, while new investors can consider entering post-listing if valuations remain reasonable and business momentum continues — particularly on any post-listing dips as a potential entry point.”Founded in 2017, Groww operates a direct-to-customer digital investment platform that allows users to invest in mutual funds, stocks, F&O, ETFs, IPOs, digital gold, and U.S. stocks. The app is particularly popular among mutual fund investors.The company also provides margin trading, algorithmic trading, credit facilities, and new fund offers (NFOs) to enhance user engagement.Its customer base includes both first-time investors and affluent clients, contributing to a healthy mix of revenue streams.The IPO comprised a fresh issue of Rs 1,060 crore and an offer for sale (OFS) of Rs 5,572 crore by existing shareholders. Proceeds from the fresh issue will fund cloud infrastructure, marketing, and capital infusion into subsidiaries such as Groww Creditserv Tech and Groww Invest Tech.Kotak Mahindra Capital, JP Morgan India, Citigroup Global Markets India, Axis Capital, and Motilal Oswal Investment Advisors were the Book Running Lead Managers, while MUFG Intime India Private Limited served as the Registrar.In FY25, Groww reported operating revenue of Rs 3,901 crore, up 49% YoY, and a PAT of Rs 1,824 crore, marking a strong turnaround from previous losses.Its EBITDA margin rose to 60.8%, supported by organic user growth and reduced marketing costs.The company’s AARPU (average revenue per user) improved to Rs 3,339 in FY25 from Rs 2,541 in FY23, showing higher profitability from its affluent investor base.Despite solid growth, analysts remain cautious due to SEBI’s tightening oversight of the F&O segment, a key revenue driver for Groww and other discount brokers.Potential restrictions on weekly options and stricter margin norms could impact trading volumes and revenue growth.At the upper price band, Groww’s valuation of 33.8x FY25 P/E is higher than peers like Angel One (19x) and Anand Rathi Wealth (25x), but analysts believe the premium is justified given Groww’s technology edge, brand visibility and expanding retail franchise.Groww is the first new-age wealthtech firm to list on the Indian bourses, marking a major milestone for the fintech ecosystem.While listing gains may be moderate, the company’s long-term prospects hinge on diversifying beyond F&O and scaling its wealth management offerings amid increasing regulatory scrutiny.","Groww made a strong debut on Dalal Street on Wednesday, with shares listing on both the BSE and NSE at a premium over the issue price.

US government shutdown: Supreme Court extends block on Snap payments; hopes rise for potential end to standoff,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-govt-shutdown-supreme-court-extends-block-on-snap-payments-hopes-rise-for-potential-end-to-standoff/articleshow/125263032.cms,"1000+ Flights Cancelled As Shutdown Severely Impacts American Aviation Sector

Snap benefits









The US Supreme Court had, once again, refused to order the Trump administration to provide full funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap). Instead it has chosen to allow congress additional time to resolve the matter through a possible agreement tied to ending the government shutdown.In an order issued on Tuesday (local time), the justices extended a temporary halt on a lower court ruling that had required the administration to release full food benefit payments. The stay remains active until November 13, effectively putting the funding issue on hold without the court examining the legal arguments of either side.The dispute reached the Supreme Court after Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, who handles emergency requests from the 1st US Circuit Court of Appeals’ jurisdiction, paused a district court-imposed deadline for the payments while the appeals judges reviewed the case.Jackson, one of the court’s liberal justices, approved an emergency request from the administration, even though the matter involves a programme strongly supported by Democrats. In the latest order, Jackson stated she disagreed with the court’s decision to keep the pause in place on full Snap funding.Meanwhile, lawmakers are racing to reach a broader deal. The House of Representatives is expected to vote on Wednesday on a plan to reopen the government through January 30.That proposal includes full-year funding for several federal agencies and services, covering food assistance and benefits for veterans.The department of justice has warned the Supreme Court that judicial intervention risks complicating shutdown negotiations.Government lawyers, according to USA Today, have argued that the lower courts introduced a “massively inappropriate new variable” and disrupted the operation of Snap. Solicitor General John Sauer wrote, ""Congress appears to be on the brink of breaking the deadlock, though that outcome is unsure.”“The district court’s unlawful orders risk upsetting that compromise and throwing into doubt how innumerable critical federal programs will be funded,"" Sauer was further quoted by the agency.The legal fight began when the US district judge John McConnell in Rhode Island ordered the administration to use contingency Snap funds and other available money to ensure full November payments reached states by November 7. The appeals court sided with McConnell, ruling that the danger of leaving tens of millions of Americans without adequate food support outweighed the administration’s objections to using alternative funds.The groups opposing the Trump administration have argued that Snap recipients had “now gone ten days without the help they need to afford food,” warning that millions of Americans, including children, were already going hungry.Almost 42 million people across the country rely on food stamps, which are distributed in phases throughout the month. According to Code for America, an organisation that helps governments improve access to public benefit programmes, about 27 million of them should have received their payments by Monday.US households, according to CNN, on an average get roughly $350 a month to purchase food, but for many families, that money runs out quickly.","The US Supreme Court extended a temporary halt on a lower court ruling that had required the administration to release full food benefit payments.

Commercial vehicle manufacturers eye heavy duty demand,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/commercial-vehicle-manufacturers-eye-heavy-duty-demand/articleshow/125337141.cms,"



CHENNAI: Commercial vehicle manufacturers are projecting a strong second half for FY26, supported by improving industry conditions and robust demand triggers. Growth in the medium and heavy commercial vehicle (M&HCV) segment is expected to accelerate to high single digits in H2, with all major CV sub-segments likely to close the fiscal on a positive note.The first half of the fiscal marked a turnaround for the CV industry after nearly two subdued years, and the momentum has carried into the second half, with CV makers reporting healthy growth in Oct.Girish Wagh, MD & CEO, Tata Motors , said the CV sector's growth momentum is expected to continue across categories in H2. The GST rate cut has boosted consumption and improved vehicle utilisation, supporting truck demand in the M&HCV segment. Mining, construction, and infrastructure activity have picked up, lifting demand for tippers, while LCV demand has strengthened due to lower effective prices for B2C buyers. ""We expect high single-digit growth in the M&HCV segment in H2,"" he said.The overall CV market - including light, medium, and heavy trucks and buses - recorded total volumes of 4.63 lakh units in H1, a 4% year-on-year increase.Shenu Agarwal, MD & CEO, Ashok Leyland , said industry demand improved further in October, with the M&HCV segment growing by around 7% and its addressable LCV segment expanding nearly 15%.""The market is clearly positive. Nov and Dec should be much better, and growth may turn out slightly higher than the original forecast for the year,"" he said.The GST rate cut has also lowered vehicle prices and reduced EMIs, prompting a likely shift among fleet operators from used trucks to new, feature-rich models, said Paramjit Singh Chadha, MD, ZF Commercial Vehicle Control Systems India. The LCV segment is also projected to gain further traction, driven directly by GST reductions and indirectly by rising consumption, supporting sustained growth through the rest of the fiscal.","Growth in the medium and heavy commercial vehicle (M&HCV) segment is expected to accelerate to high single digits in H2.

Flipkart cuts seller fees to take on Meesho,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/flipkart-cuts-seller-fees-to-take-on-meesho/articleshow/125336865.cms,"



MUMBAI: Walmart-owned Flipkart will no longer charge any commission to sellers for products priced within Rs 1,000, which covers broad se-lection of the product listings on the platform. In a move that analysts say has been taken to fend off competition from value commerce player Meesho, Flipkart will also not charge commission for any product sold on its hyper-value platform Shopsy.The value offering essentially caters to the masses and low-income segments with a large share of the products priced at a few hundred rupees. “Unlike Flipkart and Amazon, Meesho doesn’t chare take rates to merchants but makes money on advertisements and mark-up on logistics,” analysts at BofA said.Commission on the platform ranges between 6%-7% and can go upto 15%. Commission is a fee that sellers pay e-commerce firms such as Flipkart and Amazon for every sale made through the platforms.Flipkart is also slashing re-turn fees for sellers by Rs 35. In an interview to TOI,Kapil Thi- rani, business unit head, marketplace and Shopsy at Flipkart said that these steps, to be implemented from Nov 19, would reduce the cost of doing business for sellers by about 30%.If sellers pass on the entire benefit to consumers over and above the GST cuts, prices for them could drop by the same quantum, potentially boosting online consumption ahead of the winter festivities and nudging more middle-class shoppers to go online.“We want to make sure that demand grows further...it is in line with what govt has also been trying to do. The bigger impact will be on the end consumer pricing. Once sellers passes on the benefits, consumption should increase,” Thirani said. Already, the GST cuts, income tax benefits and lower inflation have aided consumption with Flipkart having seen better sales in November so far led by fashion and beauty and personal care segments, said Thirani. “With winters setting in early, a lot of demand is coming in for winter products,” Thirani added.In March this year, rival Amazon had slashed commission on products priced under Rs 300. Flipkart is betting on the move to also get sellers from more smaller towns to shift to e-commerce. With reduced costs, existing sellers are also expected to broaden selection of products for consumers, said Thirani. “Key manufacturing hubs like Shantipur, Morbi and Khurja are not that digitised yet and it is a great opportunity for us to get them on our platform,” Thirani added.In a recent note, BofA Securities said that the mass-market value focused users are largely on Meesho, premium users are on Amazon while urban and tier one and two city users are on Flipkart.","Flipkart will no longer charge any commission to sellers for products priced within Rs 1,000. The value offering essentially caters to the masses and low- income segments. Flipkart is also slashing re-turn fees for sellers by Rs 35.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125337134,imgsize-69570,width-400,resizemode-4/.jpg"
GST cut drives MSME loan demand,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gst-cut-drives-msme-loan-demand/articleshow/125337152.cms,"New GST Rates Take Effect; Farmers, Shopkeepers, Consumers React to New Tax Structure





CHENNAI/MUMBAI: The GST rate cut is driving MSMEs to seek additional funding from banks for expansion. After the GST rejig, banks have seen a spike in enquiries for advances from the MSMEs. It comes amid lenders having moved closer to their annual targets for the MSME segment in the first half of the current fiscal.For instance, state-owned Indian Overseas Bank has recorded its MSME portfolio touching Rs 48,000 crore as of Sept 30, 2025, out of the total target of Rs 51,000 crore for the full financial year, a 16.7% increase YoY.Indian Overseas Bank's MD & CEO Ajay Kumar Srivastava said govt has taken several initiatives to accelerate MSME growth, such as their classification and turnover. Noting that the bank is likely to reach Rs 55,000 crore in its MSME portfolio this fiscal, he said, GST will be one of the major factors. ""We are focusing on the manufacturing (in the MSME) sector,"" he added.To target the high-growth MSME segment, the country's largest lender SBI has launched digital MSME loans. These loans offer MSMEs end-to-end sanctions in 45 minutes. The bank has processed nearly 2.3 lakh such accounts with credit limits of Rs 74,434 crore up to Aug 2025.Indian Bank MD & CEO Binod Kumar said, there has been good traction from the MSMEs, with the YoY growth tripled from 5-6% to around 17% (FY25 vs FY26). ""We are seeing demand mainly from the services sector, including hospitality. It is for their expansion plans or setting up new hotels both during pre- and post-GST 2.0. Major demand is also coming from the ancillary units. We will exceed our target for MSMEs this year,"" he said.PNB has launched a slew of products, including comprehensive financing up to Rs 100 crore, digital MSME loans enable paperless lending up to Rs 25 lakh. The bank has also introduced a fully digital MSME loan of up to Rs 5 crore backed by CGTMSE guarantee and concessional rates.Bankers said that another reason for the thrust on MSME loans is that the new regulations on expected credit loss make it less capital intensive for banks to lend to MSMEs.","After the GST rejig, banks have seen a spike in enquiries for advances from the MSMEs.

NEW DELHI: The new digital personal data protection law, that becomes operational after the passage of supporting rules, mandates companies handling digital data to immediately inform users and the newly-constituted data protection board about any breaches to drive transparency in data handling processes.As soon as the entity involved in the processing of personal data learns about breach, it will need to inform each affected user without delay, including a description of the breach, the extent and timing of the occurrence. Besides, the consequences of the breach and the measures taken to mitigate risk, along with the safety measures to protect their interests need to be communicated. Similar intimation will need to be given to the Data Protection Board.Also, there will be additional obligations on companies as they will need to update the board with further details and information about the breach within 72 hours. The rules mandate that companies dealing with online data will need to ""prominently publish"" on their website or app the business contact information of the Data Protection Officer, who will answer queries of the users about the processing of their personal data.However, it will be some time before the users can avail of the full powers provided under the law.

RBI eases repayment rules for exporters amid turmoil,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/rbi-eases-repayment-rules-for-exporters-amid-turmoil/articleshow/125336860.cms,"



MUMBAI: Days after govt announced the 'export promotion mission' and easier loan flow, RBI has eased repayment rules for exporters by giving them more time to bring in the proceeds and allowing banks to offer temporary relief on trade-related loans.The changes, issued through a Gazette notification on Nov 13 amending Fema rules and a circular to lenders, extend the deadline for realisation of export payments to 15 months (from 9 months) and relax several loan conditions to help firms hit by global trade disruptions.The move comes as exporters shipping to the US face pressure after Washington imposed tariffs and additional sanction-linked duties on imports tied to Russian oil. RBI's relaxation of timelines and credit conditions is intended to cushion exporters dealing with delayed payments, squeezed margins and rising compliance checks in their key markets.Under the amended Fema regulations, exporters have 15 months instead of nine to bring back their export earnings. The deadline to settle or adjust advance payments received from overseas buyers has been extended to three years from one year.RBI said the longer timelines are meant to ease pressure on exporters struggling with delays in shipments and payments.A separate circular to banks, cooperatives and NBFCs outlines how lenders should support affected exporters. Firms in specified sectors that held standard export credit as of Aug 31 may be offered a four-month moratorium on loan installments and interest from Sept 1 to Dec 31. Interest will continue to accrue, but only as simple interest. Lenders may convert this into a separate loan, which can be repaid between April and Sept 2026.Banks have also been allowed to ease working-capital rules by reducing margins and recalculating drawing power. They may give exporters up to 450 days to repay pre-shipment and post-shipment credit.Exporters who have produced goods but cannot ship them may repay packing credit using domestic sales or proceeds from other export orders. RBI said these relaxations will not be treated as restructuring, and lenders must ensure borrowers' credit histories are not affected. Banks will, however, need to create a 5% general provision against such accounts as a prudential buffer.The central bank said the measures are intended to prevent short-term trade disruptions from turning into defaults, give exporters flexibility to manage cash flows and allow lenders to support viable firms without weakening credit discipline.",RBI extends the deadline for realisation of export payments to 15 months (from 9 months) The deadline to settle or adjust advance payments received from overseas buyers has been extended to three years from one year.

The Reserve Bank of India RBI ) on Friday announced a sweeping set of trade relief measures aimed at easing the pressure on exporters battling global headwinds, supply-chain delays and tightening liquidity, according to an ANI report.The relief package — effective immediately — expands export timelines, relaxes credit norms and grants temporary leeway on loan repayments to help sectors hit hardest by prolonged payment cycles and uncertain overseas demand.Under FEMA rules, the RBI has extended the period for realisation and repatriation of export proceeds from nine months to 15 months for goods, software and services. Exporters also get more flexibility on advance-payment shipments: the timeline for shipping goods against advances has been stretched from one year to three years, or as per contract terms, whichever is later.The move is expected to ease pressure on exporters facing delayed deliveries and payment uncertainties.The RBI has also notified the Reserve Bank of India (Trade Relief Measures) Directions, 2025, allowing stressed exporters temporary repayment relief.All term loan instalments and interest on working-capital credit falling due between September 1 and December 31, 2025, may now be deferred. Banks have been allowed to recalculate drawing power by adjusting margins or revisiting working-capital needs during this period.In a major relaxation, the maximum credit period for pre-shipment and post-shipment export credit has been extended from 270 days to 450 days for loans disbursed up to March 31, 2026. This is expected to support exporters contending with elongated order and payment cycles.Exporters who availed packing credit on or before August 31, 2025, but could not dispatch goods, may now liquidate these facilities through legitimate alternative means.

India has asked Russia to fast-track approvals for Indian exporters --including expedited listing of domestic establishments and quicker registration of marine and pharmaceutical products -- as part of a broader push to expand two-way trade, the commerce ministry said on Thursday.Commerce secretary Rajesh Agrawal, currently in Moscow, stressed the need for “confidence-building measures to unlock market access” during discussions with Russian officials at the 26th Meeting of the India-Russia Working Group on Trade and Economic Cooperation, reported ET.“The issues included expedited listing of Indian establishments and a systems-based approach with FSVPS in agriculture, especially marine products and a time-bound pathway in pharmaceuticals covering registration, regulatory reliance and predictable timelines,” the official statement said, quoted ET. FSVPS is Russia’s Federal Service for Veterinary and Phytosanitary Supervision.Agrawal and Russian deputy minister of economic development Vladimir Ilyichev finalised and signed a forward-looking protocol covering multiple sectors aimed at strengthening economic ties. Bilateral trade currently stands at $25 billion, with both sides committed to raising it to $100 billion by 2030.The working group identified opportunities across engineering goods, chemicals and plastics, electronics, pharmaceuticals, agriculture, leather and textiles.It also mapped areas where Indian strengths --including smartphones, motor vehicles, gems and jewellery, organic chemicals, textiles and leather -- can support Russia’s trade diversification and de-risking strategy.In services, India encouraged Russian entities to increase procurement of Indian IT-BPM, healthcare, education and creative services. It also pushed for predictable mobility for Indian professionals amid growing labour shortages in Russia.India highlighted its global capability centre (GCC) ecosystem -- over 1,700 centres employing nearly 1.9 million professionals -- as a ready platform for Russian firms to enhance business continuity, cybersecurity, design, analytics and shared-services support, bolstering supply-chain resilience.The Indian side acknowledged Russia’s interest in concluding a bilateral investment treaty.

Trade ties: Switzerland secures US tariff cut to 15%; $200 bn investment push announced,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/trade-ties-switzerland-secures-us-tariff-cut-to-15-200-bn-investment-push-announced/articleshow/125331702.cms,"



Switzerland has announced a $200 billion investment plan in the US through 2028, coinciding with a breakthrough agreement that will sharply cut US tariffs on most Swiss goods. The deal lowers duties from 39% - the highest imposed on any Western economy - to 15%, aligning Swiss exporters with the tariff regime applied to the European Union, AP reported.Economy Minister Guy Parmelin said in Bern that the agreement was made possible by “new momentum generated by the commitment of the American president” and is expected to take effect in the coming weeks. The White House confirmed the development and said companies from Switzerland and Liechtenstein would account for $67 billion of the planned investment in 2026.A White House fact sheet said the proposed investments would create “thousands of well-paying American jobs across all 50 states” in sectors including pharmaceuticals, machinery, medical devices, aerospace, construction, advanced manufacturing, gold refining and energy infrastructure.The US, which ran a goods trade deficit of more than $38 billion with Switzerland last year, said the agreement “will put us on a path to eliminate that deficit by 2028.” US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer told CNBC that Switzerland would shift some manufacturing of pharmaceuticals, gold smelting and railway equipment to the United States.The tariff rollback follows months of tension after Washington first raised duties on Swiss products to 31% in April as part of its “Liberation Day” tariff actions and then to 39% on July 31.The spike prompted a sustained diplomatic and corporate effort from Bern, which intensified over the past month.Switzerland, already among the largest foreign investors in the US, said the $200 billion plan would be driven by private-sector commitments coordinated under what Parmelin described as “Team Switzerland”. It is not yet clear how much of the investment is new; Roche had earlier announced a $50 billion US investment during the tariff escalation.Several categories of Swiss exports — including pharmaceuticals, chemicals, gold and semiconductor-related goods — had been exempted from the highest tariff slab, but other sectors such as industrial machinery, watches, coffee and cheese remained affected. Parmelin said some tariffs deemed “important”, including in aviation, would be suspended under the new deal, while Switzerland would continue negotiations to ease duties in remaining sectors.The agreement follows an intensive diplomatic campaign, with delegations to Washington led by Swiss President Karin Keller-Sutter and Parmelin. Last week, senior executives from Rolex, gold refiner MKS Pamp and luxury group Richemont met President Donald Trump at the Oval Office to press Bern’s case.","Deal lowers duties from 39% - the highest imposed on any Western economy - to 15%.

US stock market stayed volatile on Friday, extending the turbulence from the previous session as major AI-linked stocks swung sharply and triggered another day of unsettled trading across Wall Street.The S&P 500 slipped 0.5% after recovering part of an early 1.3% slide. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 485 points, or 1%, while the Nasdaq composite edged 0.4% lower by 10 a.m. Eastern time, showing little stability after Thursday’s sell-off.AI stocks remained the focal point. Nvidia — which has become the market’s most influential beneficiary of the AI boom — moved from a steep early loss to a small gain of 0.1%, pulling broader indices with it. The company’s stock, which has more than doubled in four of the last five years, is still within sight of records that helped push the S&P 500 to all-time highs late last month, AP reported.“Occasional market drops are the price of the ticket for the ride,” said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management, as traders continued to debate the sustainability of AI-driven valuations. Nvidia’s earnings next week are now seen as critical, with analysts warning that any shortfall could trigger deeper declines because the stock exerts the single largest influence on the S&P 500.Outside technology, Walmart fell 1.5% after announcing that CEO Doug McMillon will retire in January, a move that surprised investors given his role in expanding the retailer’s digital operations.Market sentiment was also shaped by interest-rate uncertainty. The yield on the 10-year Treasury held at 4.11%, unchanged from late Thursday, as traders reassessed the likelihood of another Federal Reserve rate cut in December. While the Fed has lowered rates twice this year, officials have signalled caution due to inflation remaining above the 2% target and delays in economic data caused by the U.S. government shutdown.Bitcoin, which often reacts to shifts in rate expectations, briefly slipped below $95,000 before recovering slightly, far below the nearly $125,000 level seen in October. Gold dropped nearly 3% as higher-rate worries dampened demand for non-yielding assets.Global markets also mirrored Wall Street’s weakness. South Korea’s Kospi tumbled 3.8%, London’s FTSE 100 lost 1.5%, and indices across Europe and Asia traded sharply lower. The sell-off extended pressure on equities from Seoul to Shanghai, where markets fell amid broader caution and sector-specific concerns.","The S&P 500 slipped 0.5% after recovering part of an early 1.3% slide.

China’s consumer spending lost further momentum in October, with official figures showing the weakest pace of retail growth in more than a year.The numbers, released on Friday highlight the difficulty authorities are facing as they try to lift confidence among households still reluctant to spend.According to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), retail sales were up 2.9% year-on-year last month, easing from the 3% rise recorded in September. The performance marked the slowest expansion since August of the previous year and extended a five-month pattern of moderating growth from the 6.4% high reached in May.At a briefing in Beijing, NBS chief economist Fu Linghui acknowledged the strain on the broader economy.“External instability and uncertainty factors remain numerous, domestic structural adjustment pressures are significant, and the stable operation of the economy faces many challenges,"" he told AFP.China has struggled with muted domestic demand since the end of Covid restrictions, while long-running stress in the property market continues to weigh on households. Economists have argued that a shift towards consumption-driven growth will be essential, as infrastructure investment and exports, once the main engines, offer less support.Even so, officials are pressing ahead with a five percent growth target for 2025, which analysts still consider achievable.October’s spending slowdown coincided with efforts by Beijing and Washington to ease their trade dispute. Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping reached a one-year truce in October aimed at reducing the damage from the long-running trade war. China’s exports have held up through most of the year despite U.S. tariffs, helped by stronger shipments to markets such as Southeast Asia. However, reviving activity at home has been considerably harder.Last month’s Communist Party meeting on economic planning placed emphasis on boosting demand, with leaders calling for the country to “vigorously boost consumption”. A report issued this week by Moody’s Ratings warned that China’s “domestic demand may be slow to revive”, adding that new priorities include “accelerating innovation in strategic technologies and reinforcing domestic demand through structural improvements in income distribution and social safety nets”.Factory output also missed expectations. Industrial production rose 4.9% in October compared with a year earlier, below Bloomberg’s 5.5% forecast and the slowest increase since August of last year.“A key drag came from weaker external demand -- export values and industrial sales for export both weakened significantly,” said Zichun Huang of Capital Economics in a note on the latest data.She further told AFP that “the economy [is expected] to remain weak over the coming quarter” and said the trade truce with Washington “is unlikely to provide much relief”.The country’s housing market continued to deteriorate. New home prices fell year-on-year in 61 of the 70 major cities tracked by the NBS in October, reflecting the ongoing impact of a debt crisis that has gripped the sector since 2020. “The housing sector still clouds the overall outlook,” wrote Sheana Yue, Senior Economist at Oxford Economics.Investment figures also pointed to softening conditions. Fixed-asset investment declined 1.7% in the January–October period from a year earlier, following a 0.5% drop in September when the measure first turned negative.","China's consumer spending lost further momentum in October, official figures show.

South Korea and the US have reached an agreement, covering areas such as nuclear power, tariff concerns, AI and more.South Korean President Lee Jae Myung on Friday announced that the two nations have finalised a joint face sheet agreement on trade and security issues.

Kim also said South Korea will invest $350bn (£265bn) in the United States, including $200bn in cash and $150bn dedicated to shipbuilding.Earlier this year, Trump had imposed a 25% tariff rate on Seoul, which Lee later negotiated down to 15% after Seoul committed the investment in the US and agreed to buy $100bn worth of liquefied natural gas. However as talks continued, the White House raised its demands, with Trump pressing for increased cash investment in the United States.However, now the countries have reached a “mutual understanding” that Seoul’s investment should not lead to “market instability.”Even if the signs of market instability occur, South Korea could seek an adjustment in the payments, asking the US to change the amount and the timing of funding.","South Korean President Lee Jae Myung announced that the two nations have finalised a joint face sheet agreement on trade and security issues.

US mortgage rates edge up again: 30-year rate climbs to 6.24% in a week from 6.22%; housing affordability remains a key concern,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-mortgage-rates-edge-up-again-30-year-rate-climbs-to-6-24-per-cent-in-a-week-from-6-22-housing-affordability-remains-a-key-concern/articleshow/125308834.cms,"Representa





The 30-year US mortgage rate rose slightly for the second consecutive week but stayed close to its lowest level of the year.Freddie Mac, quoted by AP, reported on Thursday that the long-term mortgage rate increased to 6.24 per cent from 6.22 per cent the previous week. A year earlier, the rate stood at 6.78 per cent. The rate reached 6.17 per cent a fortnight ago, marking its lowest point in over a year.The 15-year fixed-rate mortgage, often preferred by homeowners for refinancing, edged down to 5.49 per cent from 5.5 per cent last week, compared to 5.99 per cent during the same period last year.Mortgage rates are influenced by several factors, including Federal Reserve policy, and bond market expectations on inflation and the economy. These rates generally track the 10-year Treasury yield, a key benchmark for home loan pricing, which stood at 4.10 per cent by Thursday midday — a slight increase from the previous week.Higher mortgage rates continue to weigh on homebuyers’ purchasing power. Rates have remained above 6 per cent since September 2022, when they began climbing from historic lows, triggering a prolonged housing market slowdown.Sales of existing US homes hit their lowest level in nearly 30 years in 2022.Although activity remained muted this year, sales rose in September to their highest since February as borrowing costs eased.“Lower rates could finally be prompting some buyers to get into the market, which could lead to a surprisingly busy November and December, a time of the year when home sales activity usually slows,” said Lisa Sturtevant, chief economist at Bright MLS.Home purchase loan applications rose nearly 6 per cent last week to their highest level since September, despite the modest rate increase, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.The recent drop in mortgage rates has also benefited homeowners refinancing existing loans. Refinancing applications accounted for about 56 per cent of total mortgage activity last week, a slight dip from the previous week.Rates began easing in July, ahead of the Federal Reserve’s September decision to cut its main interest rate for the first time in a year, amid growing concerns over labour market conditions. Despite another rate cut last month, Fed Chair Jerome Powell cautioned that future reductions were “not guaranteed.”According to CME Group data, traders have trimmed expectations of another Fed rate cut in December to 53 per cent, down from nearly 70 per cent a week earlier.While the Fed does not directly set mortgage rates, its short-term rate moves influence borrowing costs indirectly. When the central bank made its first rate cut in over four years last autumn, mortgage rates unexpectedly climbed above 7 per cent in January 2023, as the 10-year Treasury yield approached 5 per cent.Despite rates falling from their 2025 highs, housing affordability remains a major hurdle following sharp property price increases. The Trump administration’s recent proposal to introduce 50-year mortgages to address the affordability crisis has drawn criticism from several economists and policymakers.","The 30-year US mortgage rate rose slightly for the second consecutive week but stayed close to its lowest level of the year.

Ford CEO highlights widening gap between open jobs and available talent

The fallout of shrinking trade education

What companies like Ford are doing to retain workers

A generational shift and one silver lining





Ford Motor Company CEO Jim Farley has issued one of his starkest warnings yet about America’s labour future, revealing that the company is struggling to fill 5,000 skilled-mechanic roles despite offering salaries of around $120,000. Calling it a “serious problem” for the country, Farley said the shortage of trained workers is no longer an industry issue. It is a national crisis that threatens manufacturing, emergency services and the trades that keep the US economy functioning.Farley shared the figures during an appearance on the Office Hours: Business Edition podcast, saying Ford is not alone in the struggle. Across the US, more than one million skilled-trade and manual-labour positions remain vacant, including jobs in emergency response, trucking, plumbing, electrical work, manufacturing and factory operations.“We are in trouble in our country,” Farley warned, pointing out that many of these jobs form the backbone of American industry. Despite competitive pay, including six-figure packages at Ford, the talent pipeline simply is not keeping up with demand.Recent federal data backs him up. As of August, more than 400,000 manufacturing jobs were open nationwide, even with unemployment rising to 4.3 percent. This is a sign that the labour gap is driven not by job scarcity but by a dramatic decline in the supply of trained workers.One of the biggest problems, Farley argues, is the collapse of trade-based education and apprenticeships. He highlighted that becoming a top-tier mechanic or technician, for example someone who can remove a diesel engine from a Ford Super Duty truck, requires years of training and hands-on experience.“We do not have trade schools,” Farley said, criticising decades of underinvestment in vocational education. “We are not educating the next generation of people like my grandfather, who built a middle-class life.”His reference is personal. Farley’s own grandfather was employee No. 389 at Ford and worked on the Model T, a reminder of how factory and trade work once propelled millions into stable livelihoods.Farley noted that Ford has already taken major steps to make its jobs more appealing. The company eliminated the lowest tier in its wage structure and agreed to a 25 percent pay increase over four years as part of its contract with the United Auto Workers in 2023.Yet even with improved pay and benefits, skilled-trade positions remain among the hardest in America to fill, a sign, Farley says, that the issue is structural, not simply financial.Interestingly, Farley suggested younger Americans may be key to solving the crisis. After years of declining interest in trade jobs, Gen Z is now pushing back against the traditional college-only pathway, with trade-school enrolment rising 16 percent last year, the highest since tracking began in 2018.The surge reflects growing frustration with student debt and a renewed awareness that skilled jobs can offer stability, mobility and strong salaries, often without a four-year degree.But while this trend is encouraging, Farley cautioned that it may not be enough to close the labour gap quickly. Skilled trades require long training curves, and decades of underinvestment mean it will take years to rebuild the pipeline.Farley’s warning is blunt. Without rapid reinvestment in training, apprenticeships and vocational pathways, the US risks choking its own economic engine. From repairing vehicles and maintaining infrastructure to keeping factories running, the trades remain essential and the shortage is becoming too large to ignore.","Ford Motor Company CEO Jim Farley has issued one of his starkest warnings yet about America’s labour future.

Stock markets in the United States were at a low as investors await further economic indicators. The S&P 500 declined by 0.4% in early Thursday trading, moving away from its recent record high achieved in the previous month.The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 41 points, while the Nasdaq composite fell 0.7%. After the longest shutdown in its history lasting six weeks, the US government has resumed operations.Investors are bracing for possible market fluctuations as the government begins issuing crucial updates regarding employment figures and other economic indicators. The United States government has reopened after a six-week shutdown — the longest in its history. While the stock market largely gained during the closure, as it has in previous shutdowns, Wall Street is now bracing for potential volatility as the government resumes publishing key economic data, including job market and inflation reports.Investors are concerned that fresh data could prompt the Federal Reserve to pause its interest rate cuts. Although such cuts typically support economic growth, they also risk fuelling inflation.Wall Street’s recent rally to record highs has been driven in part by expectations of continued rate reductions, and a change in that outlook could weigh on stocks.The “looming data deluge may spur additional volatility in the coming weeks,” said Doug Beath, global equity strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute.Traders have scaled back expectations for another rate cut at the Fed’s next meeting in December, now pricing in a roughly 54 per cent chance — down from nearly 70 per cent a week earlier, according to CME Group data.That shift pushed bond yields slightly higher, a move that typically pressures stock prices. The yield on the 10-year US Treasury rose to 4.10 per cent from 4.08 per cent late Wednesday.On Wall Street, The Walt Disney Co. was among the biggest drags on the market, sliding 8.4 per cent.

Piyush Goyal Sends Strong Reply To Donald Trump, Says India Wants Fair But Balanced Trade Agreement





The global oil market is tilting towards oversupply as production growth continues to outpace consumption despite a rise in Chinese demand, according to the International Energy Agency’s (IEA) latest monthly report released on Thursday.The IEA projected that worldwide oil production will exceed demand by more than four million barrels per day (bpd) in 2026, following an upward revision in its global supply forecast.“Global oil market balances are looking increasingly lopsided, as world oil supply is forging ahead while oil demand growth remains modest by historical standards,” the agency said, as quoted by AFP.The IEA noted several uncertainties influencing its projections, including the economic fallout of tariff disputes, US government shutdown (which is ending as Trump signs order), and the impact of Western sanctions on Russia, a major oil producer.Global oil output is expected to rise by 3.1 million bpd in 2025 and by an additional 2.5 million bpd in 2026. While consumption is also growing, its pace remains far slower than supply expansion.Demand growth is forecast to decline in the fourth quarter of 2025 compared with the previous quarter, “adding to market balances that look increasingly askew,” the report stated.Despite the imbalance, Brent crude prices edged slightly higher to 63.05 dollars per barrel on Thursday, though they remain down around 17 per cent over the past year.","The IEA projected that worldwide oil production will exceed demand by more than four million barrels per day in 2026.

Trump's Hawk In Beijing: Kash Patel Holds Secret Meeting With Xi Jinping | Shocking ‘Deal’ Details

Deal promises versus market reality

Soy stocks hit record highs

No rush to buy





China’s ports are brimming with soybeans after months of record imports, dimming hopes for US exporters even as Trump and Xi reached a new trade understanding including fresh purchase commitments from Beijing.Massive reserves, weak processing margins and cheaper South American supplies have combined to stall demand for US beans.“State firms may be waiting for margins to recover before making large-scale purchases,” said Johnny Xiang, founder of Beijing-based AgRadar Consulting. “Even with tariff waivers, margins remain negative and Brazilian beans are still cheaper.”Following a meeting between Donald Trump and Xi Jinping last month, US officials announced that China had agreed to buy 12 million tonnes of soybeans before the year ends and 25 million tonnes annually for the next three years. But Beijing has yet to publicly confirm those figures. While retaliatory tariffs on US imports were suspended, state trader COFCO has so far booked only a handful of cargoes for December and January, according to market participants.China’s early-year rush to secure soybeans from South America, prompted by fears that the trade conflict could persist, has left the country sitting on unusually large inventories.Data from Sublime China Information show port stocks at a record 10.3 million tonnes as of November 7, up 3.6 million tonnes year-on-year. Crushers, firms that turn beans into oil and meal, held 7.5 million tonnes, their highest since 2017.The oversupply has weighed heavily on prices. Soymeal, used to feed China’s vast pig population, has fallen by more than 20% since April, now hovering around 3,000 yuan ($421) a tonne in major coastal regions including Tianjin, Shandong, Jiangsu and Guangdong, according to Mysteel data.Profit margins for crushers have been negative since mid-year, with losses this week around 190 yuan per tonne in the processing hub of Rizhao. Analysts see little improvement before March. “There is not much room for China to increase soybean imports,” said a trader with a global oilseed processor. “Soybean stocks are huge and demand for the feed sector is very slow.”Expectations that China’s state-owned importers, COFCO and Sinograin, would quickly ramp up purchases after trade talks have so far proved unfounded. Even so, Washington appears to be holding Beijing to its reported promises.“The administration expects our trading partners to adhere to their deal commitments,” a US official told Reuters. “The president reserves the right to adjust tariff rates, export controls, and other concessions to hold our trading partners accountable to their deal commitments.”Traders estimate that state stockpiles stand at between 40 million and 45 million tonnes, roughly double last year’s US imports and enough to satisfy five months of early-year consumption.Meanwhile, private importers are favouring Brazil, where January cargoes are quoted at about $480 a tonne including freight, compared with $540–$550 for U.S. shipments. December bookings from Brazil total roughly 2 million tonnes, covering more than 40% of China’s expected monthly demand, with January purchases still slow.As Arlan Suderman, chief commodities economist at StoneX, noted in a Tuesday briefing, “There’s very little indication that state buyers are engaged in a programme to purchase 12 million metric tons ahead of the end of this year, let alone 25 million tons more for calendar year 2026.”",China’s ports are brimming with soybeans after months of record imports.

Who will get it ?





Possible timeline





Legal and political uncertainty





US President Donald Trump has revived one of his most unusual economic ideas, sending rebate cheques to Americans funded by the tariffs his administration has imposed. The announcement comes amid growing concerns about affordability across the United States.“People that are against Tariffs are FOOLS!” Trump wrote on Truth Social on Sunday. “A dividend of at least $2000 a person (not including high income people!) will be paid to everyone.”The president’s pitch builds on similar statements made in recent months.Back in August, Trump announced, “We’re taking in so much money that we may very well make a dividend to the people of America.” His claim is that the payments would come directly from the tariff revenue collected from US importers rather than taxpayer funds, a structure he argues sets it apart from the pandemic stimulus cheques distributed in 2020 and 2021.While importers are the ones who pay tariffs upfront, economists note that much of that cost is passed on to consumers through higher prices. Trump’s idea, therefore, would attempt to redistribute the same money that Americans have indirectly paid through tariffs, CNN reported.The proposal drew a cautious response from treasury secretary Scott Bessent, who said on ABC’s This Week that there is no formal plan to issue such payments.He added that Trump’s mention of a $2,000 figure “could come in lots of forms,” including adjustments related to untaxed tips, overtime or Social Security payments.The US treasury has reported that total tariff revenue collected stands at more than $220 billion, covering both tariffs imposed under Trump’s leadership and those established before his presidency.However, as per the Internal Revenue Service’s figures over 163 million Americans filed tax returns in 2024. Which means that if each filer received $2,000, the total cost would reach about $326 billion, far more than the revenue available.Even with an income cap at $100,000, roughly 150 million adults would still qualify, requiring around $300 billion, Erica York, vice president of federal tax policy at the Tax Foundation told CNN.Despite the shortfall, Trump claimed there would still be funds left to reduce the national debt. “All money left over from the $2000 payments made to low and middle income USA Citizens, from the massive Tariff Income pouring into our Country from foreign countries, which will be substantial, will be used to SUBSTANTIALLY PAY DOWN NATIONAL DEBT,” he wrote on Monday.A White House official declined to give details on eligibility, saying only, “The Administration is committed to putting this money to good use for the American people,” in a statement to CNN.If the plan moves ahead, the timeline for payments would likely vary. During the pandemic, Americans who opted for direct deposits received funds within a week of approval, while those waiting for paper cheques often had to wait nearly five months.The legality of the plan could face scrutiny in the Supreme Court, which has signalled concern over the administration’s use of emergency powers to impose tariffs. Nearly $100 billion of the total collected stems from those powers. A ruling against the administration could force a refund to businesses, significantly reducing available funds for any rebate programme.Beyond the courts, Congress would also have to approve the payments. The legislative branch controls federal spending, and past stimulus cheques required its consent. Whether Trump could gather sufficient support remains unclear, according to CNN.Historically, direct payments to households have been issued during recessions or national emergencies. With the economy not currently in either condition, economists warn that rebate cheques could intensify inflation, the very issue many Americans cite as their top concern. If inflation rises, the Federal Reserve may be compelled to increase interest rates again, creating fresh political and economic pressure.","US President Donald Trump has revived one of his most unusual economic ideas, sending rebate cheques to Americans funded by tariffs.

End of an era: US penny bids goodbye after last coin pressed in Philadelphia; 238 years old currency finally retires after Trump's order,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/end-of-an-era-us-penny-bids-goodbye-after-last-coin-pressed-in-philadelphia-238-years-old-currency-finally-retires-after-trumps-order/articleshow/125290544.cms,"A chaotic farewell - No pennies left to pay



Counting the change

‘Time to go away’







After more than two centuries of jingling in pockets and cash drawers, the American penny has reached the end of its life.The final batch of one-cent coins was pressed this week at the US Mint in Philadelphia, an event overseen by US Treasurer Brandon Beach.Earlier in February, US President Donald Trump announced that he has asked the Mint to end penny production, saying the tiny coin had become too expensive to make. Each penny now costs nearly four cents to produce, more than its actual value.Beach confirmed that the last coins made will be auctioned off, while the final pennies to enter circulation were struck in June. Despite the halt, all existing pennies will remain legal tender.The penny, first issued in 1787, predates the Mint itself by six years. It outlived its half-penny sibling by 168 years and leaves behind the nickel, dime, quarter and the little-used half-dollar and dollar coins. Once able to buy “penny candy” or pay a parking meter, the coin now lives mostly in dusty jars or “take a penny, leave a penny” trays.What should have been a quiet retirement has turned messy as retailers across the country are struggling to manage prices and payments without the one-cent coin.Some are rounding prices to the nearest nickel, often a cent or two higher, while others are asking customers to pay with pennies if they still have them. But state laws that require exact pricing are making things complicated.And while ending penny production should save money, the government might end up spending more by pressing extra nickels, which are even costlier to make.Mark Weller, executive director of Americans for Common Cents told CNN that the government’s ruling out of the penny has been “a bit chaotic.”“By the time we reach Christmas, the problems will be more pronounced with retailers not having pennies.”Weller noted that other nations, including Canada, Australia and Switzerland, handled similar transitions with clear guidance.“We had a social media post (by Trump) during Super Bowl Sunday, but no real plan for what retailers would have to do,” he said.One of the first to act was Kwik Trip, a family-run convenience store chain in the Midwest. It decided to round down cash purchases in stores short on pennies.“There’s no way that we wanted to charge (customers) an extra 2 cents because we just didn’t think that was fair,” John McHugh, the company’s spokesperson told CNN.“I mean, it’s not their fault that there’s a penny shortage.”The move will cost Kwik Trip dearly, a couple of million dollars a year, McHugh said, with 20 million customers annually and nearly one in five paying in cash.Consumers will also feel a small pinch. A Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond study in July estimated that rounding to the nearest nickel could cost households about five cents a year, totalling $6 million nationwide.But not every state allows rounding. Delaware, Connecticut, Michigan and Oregon, along with major cities including New York, Philadelphia, Miami and Washington DC, still require exact change.The rules also clash with the federal SNAP food assistance programme, which must charge users the same as everyone else. Because SNAP payments are electronic and precise, rounding for cash customers could land stores in legal trouble.“Rounding down on all transactions presents several challenges beyond the loss of an average of 2 cents per transaction,” said Jeff Lenard, spokesperson for the National Association of Convenience Stores (NACS). “We desperately need legislation that allows rounding so retailers can make change for these customers.”NACS and several retail groups have already written to Congress asking for clear legislation to cover payments now that the penny is gone.The penny was among America’s first coins, designed before the Mint even existed. Benjamin Franklin is widely credited with creating the first version, known as the Fugio cent. The modern Lincoln penny arrived in 1909 to honour the 100th anniversary of Abraham Lincoln’s birth — the first American coin to carry a president’s face.Roughly 300 billion pennies are thought to be in circulation today, worth less than $9 for every American. Most, though, rarely change hands.Still, for some, the coin’s disappearance feels personal. Joe Ditler, a 74-year-old writer and historian from Colorado, keeps a cigar box full of pennies passed down from his grandfather.He remembers flattening them on train tracks and making souvenirs from them in amusement parks. “They bring back memories that have stayed with me all my life,” he said.“The penny has had a wonderful life. But it’s probably time for it to go away.”","The penny, first issued in 1787, predates the Mint itself by six years.

Shanghai and Shenzhen also inched higher, adding 17 and 238 points respectively.Meanwhile in Hong Kong, HSI dipped 156 points or 0.58% to 26,766. Kospi also traded marginally down, shedding 2 points at 10 AM IST.US lawmakers late on Wednesday approved a bill to end the 43-day shutdown that had paralysed government operations and delayed key economic reports. Later, US President Donald Trump signed the legislation, officially reopening departments that were shuttered for weeks.But despite the breakthrough, trading sentiment was subdued. Investors are now awaiting the release of data that had been held up during the closure, hoping it will offer clues on the health of the world’s largest economy and help shape the Fed’s policy outlook.Still, the White House said October’s employment and inflation numbers might remain unavailable because data collection was interrupted during the stoppage.“Reopening also doesn't mean an instant snap-back to normal for the real economy. When you starve a system of staffing and pay for six weeks, the backlog doesn't vanish just because a bill passed at 8 pm,” wrote Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management. “The shutdown ends with a vote and a signature; the aftershocks show up in queues, call centres and cash-flow stress far away from the Capitol dome,” AFP further cited the analyst.Market caution was also amplified by concerns that the AI-driven boom in technology stocks has pushed valuations too far. Analysts warned that heavy investments in artificial intelligence could take longer than expected to generate returns, sparking fears of an eventual correction.The Nasdaq slipped for a second straight day, while the S&P 500 also struggled. In contrast, the Dow Jones Industrial Average reached a record close, helped by speculation that investors were shifting money from tech firms into traditional industrial stocks.Oil prices continued to fall after a steep four percent drop on Wednesday, following OPEC’s revised forecast that global crude markets would face a surplus in the third quarter. The group had previously projected a shortfall for the same period. The downgrade, combined with easing tensions in the Middle East and rising output among major producers, has dragged prices lower. The International Energy Agency has also projected record surpluses by 2026.In currency markets, Japan drew attention as the yen slid further. Finance Minister Satsuki Katayama told parliament on Wednesday that “the government is watching for any excessive and disorderly moves with a high sense of urgency.”Since her comments, the currency has weakened to nearly 155 per dollar, fuelling speculation that Tokyo may consider intervention. The decline comes as Japan’s central bank maintains its dovish stance on monetary policy, while US markets stabilise following the government’s reopening.","Nikkei jumped 88 points or 0.17% to 51,152.

Shutdown strain: Small US businesses reel under halted contracts; firms weigh layoffs as Congress moves to end deadlock,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/shutdown-strain-small-us-businesses-reel-under-halted-contracts-firms-weigh-layoffs-as-congress-moves-to-end-deadlock/articleshow/125280380.cms,"U.S Shutdown Twist: Inside Capitol Hill’s 36-Hour Sprint to Reopen America; All Eyes On House Dems





Small businesses across the United States that rely on federal contracts and funding are facing a severe cash crunch as the country’s longest-ever government shutdown stretches into its seventh week, forcing owners to cut costs, delay payments, and even consider layoffs, according to AP report.Lawmakers are returning to Washington to vote on a stopgap funding bill that would reopen the government through January 30. While the measure is expected to pass the Republican-controlled House despite opposition from most Democrats, small business owners say the shutdown has already caused deep disruptions that will take months to recover from.For entrepreneurs like Jackson Dalton, owner of Black Box Safety, a California-based maker of protective gear, the shutdown’s effects have been immediate.Dalton had secured a $1.9 million federal contract just a day before the shutdown began on October 1, requiring an initial $1 million outlay. “It’s had a major impact on our cash flow and operations,” he told AP, adding that suppliers had been “freaking out” as they awaited new orders.For some business owners, the uncertainty has led to difficult choices. Eric Veal, founder of Interactive Knowledge in North Carolina — which develops digital exhibits for museums and cultural institutions — said 60% of his business depends on the Smithsonian Institution, which operates under partial federal funding.With federal staff unable to work, “projects are at a complete halt,” he said.Veal has cut expenses and may be forced to consider layoffs if the shutdown extends beyond mid-November. “Our cash flow is affected, and we’ve marked November 15 on the calendar as the date to start considering those steps,” he said, noting that the crisis had made him rethink his company’s reliance on federal projects.The prolonged shutdown has also overshadowed other business priorities. At a recent Goldman Sachs 10,000 Small Businesses summit in Washington, attended by around 2,000 entrepreneurs, participants said their planned discussions on access to capital, AI adoption, and workforce policies were derailed by uncertainty around government operations.Joe Gelardi, CEO of Virginia-based Vectrona, which provides technology and training to defence clients, said his firm had not received payments for ongoing contracts. “We keep working because we don’t want to harm the relationship with our government customers,” he said. “But it’s really unfortunate that the burden is being transferred to us to fund and manage work the government can’t process.”Some businesses are facing outright cancellations. Karen Jenkins, founder of KRJ Consulting in South Carolina, said a major management consulting contract that was supposed to be renewed this year was scrapped amid the shutdown. “It’s affected us almost as badly as the pandemic,” she said. “We’re just trying to hold on and hope we can be a resource again when the government reopens.”Economists warn that small contractors are among the hardest hit by the impasse since they typically lack the reserves that large corporations can rely on during prolonged funding freezes. Even after the shutdown ends, many may face months of backlog, delayed payments, and lost business opportunities as federal agencies scramble to restart operations.As one small business owner put it: “We’ve survived on resilience before — but this time, even resilience is starting to run out.”",Small businesses across the U.S. that rely on federal contracts and funding are facing a severe cash crunch.

NEW DELHI: More than 1.14 lakh startups in India have created over 12 lakh jobs so far, the finance ministry said in its latest review of the Indian economy.In the report titled, ‘The Indian Economy: A Review January 2024’, the Department of Economic Affairs said that the 1.14 lakh startups recognised by the government under the 'Startup India initiative’ created more than 12 lakh jobs (as of October 2023).The state-owned e-commerce platform Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) clocked more than 63 lakh transactions till November 2023, the document read.Despite facing global challenges in 2023 like valuation issues, few IPOs, regulatory changes and macroeconomic and geopolitical trends, India remains the third largest tech start-up ecosystem globally, with over 950 tech startups founded last year.The cumulative funding for more than 31,000 tech start ups has exceeded $70 billion (from 2019 to 2023), according to a recent report by Nasscom in collaboration with Zinnov.“In 2023, despite facing global economic and regulatory challenges, Indian tech startups have prioritised the imperative of enhancing their business fundamentals, driving profitability and growth,” said Debjani Ghosh, President, Nasscom.“The proliferation of tech startups in tier 2 and 3 cities marks the ecosystem's resilience,” she added.Navigating 2024, tech startup founders expect to continue the revenue growth path with measured steps focusing on optimising expenditure and maximising profitability for B2B tech startups.Investments in deeptech will continue an upward trend in 2024.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran Udaan until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.Udaan built an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business still accounts for a very small part of India’s overall retail market but can balloon to $150 billion in sales and yield a 100% return on capital invested in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co. estimates published in the Mint newspaper.Bengaluru-based Udaan has also ventured into financing through its fintech unit which helps shopkeepers get working capital loans to buy inventory. That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says.

"Excise policy protest: Maharashtra bars, permit rooms to shut on July 14; Industry body calls tax hikes 'draconian'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/excise-policy-protest-maharashtra-bars-permit-rooms-to-shut-on-july-14-industry-body-calls-tax-hikes-draconian/articleshow/122406782.cms,"More than 20,000 bars and permit rooms across Maharashtra will observe a one-day bandh on July 14 to protest what the hospitality sector has called “draconian” tax hikes by the state government, the Indian Hotel and Restaurant Association (AHAR) said on Saturday.The association said the shutdown is aimed at opposing multiple tax increases imposed over the past year — including a 10% VAT on liquor, a 15% hike in annual licence fees, and a 60% surge in excise duty — which it claims are threatening the survival of the Rs 1.5 lakh-crore industry, PTI reported.“The entire hospitality sector in Maharashtra is bleeding. Our pleas have fallen on deaf ears. On July 14, every bar and permit room in the state will be shut in protest,” AHAR president Sudhakar Shetty said in a statement. He added that members from Mumbai, Pune, Nashik, Nagpur, and Konkan have confirmed participation.AHAR warned that the aggressive taxation regime, coupled with post-COVID recovery challenges, is making the business model unsustainable for thousands of establishments. “This is not just an economic blow, it is a death blow to an industry that contributes significantly to employment and state taxes,” said Shetty.The permit room and bar segment, which supports over 20 lakh jobs both directly and indirectly, also sustains a wider network of nearly 48,000 vendors across Maharashtra.The industry fears the hike in liquor-related levies could lead to mass unemployment and a spike in black-market alcohol smuggling from neighbouring states, further weakening state revenues.Several major industry bodies, including the National Restaurant Association of India (NRAI) and Hotel and Restaurant Association (Western India) – HRAWI, along with various affiliated and unaffiliated hotel and restaurant associations across the state, have extended support to the bandh.“We stand united with our fraternity members across Maharashtra in expressing our deep concern over these regressive policy measures. If implemented, they will further strain the already fragile business environment and hurt both consumers and operators,” said HRAWI president Jimmy Shaw.AHAR urged the Maharashtra government to roll back the tax increases and initiate discussions with stakeholders to avoid long-term damage to one of the state’s key employment-generating and tourism-supporting sectors.","More than 20,000 bars and permit rooms across Maharashtra will observe a one-day bandh on July 14.

Gold price prediction today: Gold prices have an underlying positive bias and experts believe that buying on dips may be the correct strategy for now.Gold prices have shown a decisive recovery from recent lows, with the MCX Gold August Futures (05AUG2025) currently trading around ₹97,247. The underlying tone remains positive, supported by a steady climb above key short-term moving averages. With momentum indicators turning favorable, the intraday bias shifts towards a Buy on Dip strategy near ₹97,000, with downside risk capped around ₹96,450.The 8-period EMA stands at ₹96,900, while the 21-period EMA is at ₹96,700. The price is now trading above both EMAs, indicating a short-term bullish crossover and establishing a support base around the ₹97,000 level. A successful retest of this zone could serve as an entry point for fresh long positions.The Bollinger Bands have begun to widen, with price riding along the upper band. This suggests that volatility is picking up in favor of the bulls. The lower band, placed well below ₹96,500, gives breathing room for pullbacks while maintaining the overall uptrend.Prices have managed to sustain above the previous day’s pivot, converting it into a support zone.This structure aligns with the higher-lows pattern visible on the intraday chart, reinforcing bullish conviction above ₹97,000.The Relative Strength Index is currently at 70.12, entering overbought territory but still not showing any bearish divergence. A brief consolidation or minor pullback near ₹97,000 can allow the RSI to cool off, offering a renewed entry opportunity.The MACD is inferred to be in a positive crossover state, backed by the recent trend reversal and price closing above key averages. The histogram likely reflects increasing bullish momentum.The latest candle shows a strong bullish body with a narrow upper wick, suggesting firm buying interest at the open. The price closing above the high-volume congestion zone confirms a breakout with strength.Gold intraday bias remains bullish. Traders can adopt a Buy on Dip strategy near the ₹97,000 mark, placing a protective stop-loss at ₹96,450. Upside targets for the session could be ₹97,500 and ₹97,750, provided the global sentiment remains supportive and prices hold above short-term EMAs.","Gold prices have shown a decisive recovery from recent lows, with the MCX Gold August Futures (05AUG2025) currently trading around ₹97,247.

‘Sooner or later…’: Paytm founder sees impact of AI on jobs as ‘inevitable’; says artificial intelligence will also create new roles,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sooner-or-later-paytm-founder-sees-impact-of-ai-on-jobs-as-inevitable-says-artificial-intelligence-will-also-create-new-roles/articleshow/122409161.cms,"The impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on jobs is ""inevitable"", according to Paytm founder Vijay Shekhar Sharma, who said AI will become part of routine business processes sooner rather than later. “Sooner or later we will have to start using AI as an employee or even as a CFO,” Sharma said at an AI-focused event in New Delhi.He said AI will eventually perform most tasks currently done by humans, and stressed the need to build core products instead. Sharma also outlined a broader vision for the company — to move beyond its fintech roots and become an AI-first firm, according to an ET report.Although AI will automate several human functions, Sharma said it will also create fresh roles in the workforce.The remarks come at a time when Paytm’s parent, One97 Communications, is undergoing job cuts. ET reported last month that the company had laid off an unspecified number of employees. The overall sales team headcount dropped by about 3,500 in the March 2024 quarter, taking the total to 36,521. This decline was largely linked to the Reserve Bank of India’s restrictions on Paytm Payments Bank operations.In the March quarter, Paytm posted a consolidated net loss of Rs 540 crore, compared with Rs 550 crore in the year-ago period.In June, Paytm stood third in the UPI rankings with 1.27 billion transactions worth Rs 1.34 lakh crore — accounting for 6.9% of total volume and 5.6% of value. PhonePe remained in the lead with 8.55 billion transactions valued at Rs 11.99 lakh crore.As part of its AI initiatives, Sharma announced a new passbook feature that would use Paytm’s data to generate a rap song summarising monthly expenses.

Stock market recommendations:The benchmark Nifty index spent the first four trading sessions of the last week trapped in a tight 200-point range, reflecting the indecision among market participants. But on Friday, the calm broke. The index opened with a sharp gap down, slipped below its consolidation zone, and faced renewed selling pressure, signalling that sentiment is beginning to tilt in favour of the bears.What’s more alarming is that the Nifty has now slipped below its crucial 20-day EMA, which has also begun to slope downward — a classic sign of emerging weakness. The momentum indicators aren’t painting a comforting picture either. The daily RSI has given a bearish crossover and continues to head south, while the MACD histogram has flipped into negative territory. Collectively, these signals suggest that downside momentum may be gaining strength.From a technical standpoint, immediate support now lies in the 24900–24850 zone, where the 50-day EMA is placed. A break below 24850 could push the index toward the next key support at 24550. On the flip side, a move above the 25300–25350 zone is required for bulls to regain control in the short term.Amid this technical caution, macro and earnings uncertainties are only adding to investor anxiety. With tariff uncertainty rising globally and Q1 earnings just getting started—kicked off by TCS on Thursday—markets are entering a critical phase. Investors are now watching for signs of margin pressures, global demand outlooks, and forward guidance from corporates. In this tug-of-war between technical breakdowns and earnings expectations, a cautious and stock-specific approach may be the best strategy for now.Last week, the banking benchmark index Bank Nifty moved within a tight band of just 756 points, marking its narrowest weekly range since August 2024. This lack of movement reflects heightened indecision among market participants and a clear absence of strong directional cues from the banking space. On the weekly chart, the index has formed a small-bodied bearish candle with a long upper shadow, signalling that selling pressure is emerging at higher levels. This candlestick structure typically suggests profit-booking or cautious sentiment whenever the index tries to move higher.Currently, Bank Nifty is hovering around its 20-day EMA level, reinforcing the view that the trend is at a crucial inflection point. The momentum indicators are hinting at a lack of conviction. The daily RSI remains in a sideways zone, as defined by RSI range-shift principles, further underscoring the ongoing consolidation.Going ahead, the zone of 56200-56300 will act as immediate support for the index. While on the upside, the zone of 57100-57200 will act as a crucial hurdle for the index. A decisive breakout in either direction will lead to the trending move in the index.The stock has delivered a decisive breakout from its consolidation phase on the daily chart, signalling a fresh leg of uptrend. What makes this breakout significant is the accompanying surge in volume, lending strong conviction to the move. Notably, the stock has been consistently outperforming the frontline indices over the past few trading sessions, highlighting growing investor interest and relative strength.As the stock is trading at all-time high, all the moving averages and momentum-based setups are showing strong bullish momentum. Hence, we recommend to accumulate the stock in the zone of 1155-1145 level with a stoploss of Rs 1100 level. On the upside, it is likely to test the level of 1280 in the short term.The stock registered a swing high of 1761 on June 24, followed by a throwback phase that was accompanied by subdued volumes — a sign of healthy profit booking rather than trend reversal. Notably, the correction found support near the 34-day EMA. Post this pullback, the stock has resumed its upward journey, supported by a noticeable rise in volume — adding conviction to the ongoing rebound.Over the past few sessions, it has been outperforming the frontline indices, signalling renewed strength and relative leadership. Momentum indicators are now turning increasingly positive. The daily RSI is comfortably placed in bullish territory, while other oscillators are also supporting the ongoing uptrend. The technical structure suggests that the stock may be gearing up for a fresh move higher in the short term. Hence, we recommend to accumulate the stock in the zone of 1700-1690 level with a stoploss of Rs 1620 level. On the upside, it is likely to test the level of 1900 in the short term.","The benchmark Nifty index spent the first four trading sessions of the last week trapped in a tight 200-point range.

India-US trade deal: Will Donald Trump go for less than 20% tariff rate for India?

(AI image)

Here are 10 recent developments in the India-US trade deal talks that you should know about:

1) Less than 20% tariff?

2) India officials in US Soon

3) Donald Trump on a tariff letter spree - but no letter for India so far

4) Trump says deal with India soon

5) India not working on deadlines

6) India’s trade deal issues

7) India Draws Red Lines

8) Trump's BRICS tariff threat

9) Only an interim trade deal for now

10) India-US WTO tiff

India-US trade deal: In February this year, US President Donald Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the intent for a trade deal by fall this year. Come April 2025, and Trump announced reciprocal tariffs on a lot of countries, India being one of them.The American President soon suspended his tariffs for a 90-day period giving countries time to strike a trade deal with the US. That deadline of July 9 has now been extended to August 1.A trade deal between India and the US has still not been finalized. Though, there are indications that an interim agreement may be announced soon. Trump’s tariff war has changed the global economic landscape and progress on a trade deal between the world’s largest economy (US) and the soon to be fourth largest (India) is being tracked by experts world over.The United States is negotiating an interim trade agreement with India, aiming to lower proposed tariffs to under 20%, sources with knowledge of the discussions have told Bloomberg. This would give India a competitive advantage over other countries in the region.The preliminary agreement is expected to establish a base tariff rate lower than 20%, in contrast to the 26% that was initially suggested, the report said.Meanwhile, a delegation from India's commerce ministry is scheduled to travel to Washington for fresh negotiations with the US, a government official told PTI earlier this week. The discussions will be both for an interim trade deal and the first part of the bilateral trade agreement. The delegation is likely to arrive in Washington next week, the report said.Last month an Indian delegation, headed by chief negotiator Rajesh Agrawal, were in Washington for discussions.Also Read | ‘Unnecessary trade barriers…’: US hits out at India’s dairy certificate requirements at WTO; raises issue amidst trade deal talks Donald Trump has been on a tariff letter sending spree this week. While the effective date for the reciprocal tariffs has been revised to August 1 from July 9, Trump has intimated over 20 countries of the tariff rates that will be applicable on their exports to the US.India has not been sent any such letter till now. According to a Bloomberg report, India expects a trade deal announcement soon instead of a tariff demand letter. Any interim trade deal announcement would give both India and the US time to negotiate on the final trade that is expected by fall.Earlier this week, Trump announced that America was nearing a trade agreement with India. ""We've spoken to everybody. ...it's all done. I told you we'll make some deals, but for the most part, we're going to send a letter. We're going to say, welcome to the United States if you'd like to participate in the greatest, most successful country ever. I mean we are doing better than ever... We've never had numbers like this. We've never had investment like this. We have more than 90... have much more than 90. But most of those are going to be sent to letter. This is exactly what I said. Now we've made a deal with United Kingdom. We've made a deal with China. We're close to making a deal with India,"" he said.Also Read | India takes strong stand! Retaliatory tariffs planned against US on steel and aluminium at WTO amidst trade deal talks; check details Even as the two countries look to seal a deal, India has made it clear that it is not working on any deadlines. Last week Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal said that a deal would be made keeping national interest in mind.“India never makes a trade deal based on a deadline or timeline; when the deal is good, fully matured, and in the national interest, then we accept it,” he said.“A free trade agreement happens only when there is mutual benefit. When the deal is made while safeguarding India's interests, keeping in mind that national interest will always remain paramount, then India is always ready to make deals with developed countries,” he added.India has maintained a strong position on providing duty concessions to the US for agricultural and dairy products, given their sensitive status. India's policy has consistently protected its dairy sector across all previous trade arrangements.Additionally, India continues to uphold its ban on genetically modified food crops, which contrasts with the United States' agricultural practices, where GM varieties dominate corn and soybean cultivation.Unresolved matters persist regarding duties on steel, aluminium (50 per cent) and auto (25 per cent). India is also seeking protection against future tariff hikes by the US.Also Read | Donald Trump’s $5 million Gold Card in demand!

During ongoing discussions for the limited trade pact between India and the United States, India has set definitive positions on vital areas, specifically in the agricultural and dairy sectors.""India has drawn its red lines... now the ball is in the US court,"" sources told PTI.Adding to uncertainty around tariff rates is Trump’s latest threat of an additional 10% tariff on BRICS nations for ‘Anti-America’ policies.Trump has issued warnings to BRICS nations opposing the US. ""Any Country aligning themselves with the Anti-American policies of BRICS, will be charged an ADDITIONAL 10% Tariff. There will be no exceptions to this policy. Thank you for your attention to this matter!"" Trump shared on Truth Social earlier this week.Also Read | India-US trade deal soon? Donald Trump says so, but India needs to be wary of ‘escalating pressure’; 'in future US may...' If a trade deal is announced before the August 1 deadline of Trump, it is likely only to be a mini or interim trade deal. Reports have indicated that the interim trade deal would likely leave out the contentious issues of agriculture and dairy products for now.Meanwhile, the United States has once again brought up concerns at the World Trade Organisation (WTO) about India's dairy certification requirements. The US has voiced fresh objections at the WTO, stating that India's dairy certification criteria create unnecessary barriers for dairy exports from America.The trade disputes between India and the US at the WTO extend beyond dairy matters. India has spoken of retaliatory tariffs against the United States, in accordance with WTO protocols, following American duties on steel and aluminium that were enacted as 'safeguard measures'.Additionally, India has recently signalled its plans to introduce countermeasures in response to US tariffs on automotive products.However, a government official told PTI that India's move to maintain its right for imposing reciprocal duties on the US regarding auto parts tariffs is a standard protocol under World Trade Organisation's safeguard provisions. This will not create any hindrance to the current trade agreement discussions between both nations.",A trade deal between India and the US has still not been finalized.

Better tax administration leads to surge in refunds,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/better-tax-administration-leads-to-surge-in-refunds/articleshow/122427361.cms,"Representative image

MUMBAI: Improvement in tax administration has resulted in a five-fold jump in income tax refunds, while direct tax collections rose three times over the last decade. The time taken has also fallen from 93 days to 17.""The massive increase in tax refunds and decrease in the number of days to issue refunds is due to improvements in tax administration, especially with the adoption of digital infrastructure, including end-to-end online filing and faceless assessment that enables faster and more accurate processing of income tax returns.The introduction of pre-filled returns, automation in refund processing, real-time TDS adjustments, and online grievance redress mechanisms has led to reduced delays and improved taxpayer experience,"" said a source.Refunds as a proportion of gross tax collections were estimated at 17.6 per cent during the last financial year, compared with 11.5 per cent in 2013-2014. ""It is a reflection of increased formalisation and voluntary participation in the tax system.As the taxpayer base expands and advance tax payments and TDS mechanisms deepen, excess remittances become more common. The growing volume and share of refunds are thus not merely a statistical trend but a meaningful signal of systemic maturity.It demonstrates that India's tax ecosystem is now firmly aligned with the principles of efficiency, transparency, and taxpayer facilitation,"" a source argued.Even so far during the current fiscal year, there has been no let-up in refunds despite muted growth in gross collections. Direct tax collections are 3.2 per cent higher in the financial year up to July 10, but refunds were pegged 38 per cent higher, resulting in a fall in net collections.In the past, the government would often go slow on refunds to ensure that net collections were not impacted.But the Modigovernment has gone ahead with refunds, acknowledging that stopping it holds up cash flow for businesses, impacting overall economic activity.", improvement in tax administration has resulted in a five-fold jump in income tax refunds. Direct tax collections rose three times over the last decade. The time taken has also fallen from 93 days to 17. Refunds as a proportion of gross tax collections were estimated at 17.6 per cent during the last financial year.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122427421,imgsize-528479,width-400,resizemode-4/122427421.jpg"
'New student destinations hold up education loan growth',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/new-student-destinations-hold-up-education-loan-growth/articleshow/122427329.cms,"AI image

MUMBAI: The global map of academic migration for Indian students is gradually changing, with new destinations gaining ground on traditional favourites.While the US remains a top choice, its dominance is set to decline over the next five years. According to Redseer Strategy Consultants, cited in education loan provider Credila's offer document, the number of Indian students heading to the US is expected to grow at a compound annual rate of 11-13 per cent through 2029. However, countries like Ireland, Germany, the UAE and Singapore are projected to grow faster, reflecting a broader diversification in overseas education trends.The new geographies are ensuring that growth opportunity remains strong for education loans despite visa curbs in US and Canada.Ireland is likely to lead with a projected CAGR of 19-21 per cent, followed by Germany at 15-17 per cent, the UAE at 14-16 per cent, and Singapore at 13-15 per cent. These emerging destinations are attracting Indian students with more favourable immigration and work policies.Germany is popular for its policy of free public university education and a relatively open job market. Ireland offers student-friendly visa rules and robust post-study work opportunities. The UAE is benefiting from a fast-growing job market, while Singapore's appeal lies in its growing postgraduate programmes and geographic proximity to India. The changingThe shift is also influenced by the economic advantage of studying abroad. Credila notes that average annual salaries for graduates in the US range from Rs 53.95 lakh to Rs 95.45 lakh, compared to Rs 5.8 lakh to Rs 10.8 lakh in India.","The number of Indian students heading to the US is expected to grow at a compound annual rate of 11-13 per cent through 2029.

Rural boost: RBI allows gold pledge for agricultural loans,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/rural-boost-rbi-allows-gold-pledge-for-agricultural-loans/articleshow/122427169.cms,"Representative image

MUMBAI: A new directive issued by the RBI permits banks to accept voluntary pledges of gold or silver from borrowers seeking agricultural and MSME loans, even within the limits traditionally classified as ""collateral-free"". This will help small borrowers, particularly in rural India, get easier terms on their loans.According to the circular issued on July 11, banks may now accept household gold and silver as collateral for loans under Rs 2 lakh, provided the pledge is voluntary. ""This regulatory clarification ensures that a borrower's choice to pledge personal gold or silver does not disqualify them from collateral-free benefits,"" a banker said.The change is expected to enhance financial inclusion. In rural India, gold remains the most liquid household asset. By allowing its use as security, banks can process loans faster, especially critical during sowing seasons or emergencies. Gold-backed loans are easier to disburse, reducing dependence on informal moneylenders and tightening repayment discipline.In 2023, the RBI had asked banks to classify all loans that were advanced against the security of jewellery as 'gold loans'.However, this reclassification also meant that banks would need to apply the stricter repayment norms that are applicable to gold loans, unlike loans to farmers, where some flexibility is provided for the seasonality of income. Because of the reclassification, the gold loan portfolio of public sector banks almost doubled last year.Banks, in turn, benefit from a lower risk profile. Secured lending makes it easier to expand credit to underserved rural borrowers. The move could also help banks meet priority sector lending goals. The rules permit only physical gold and silver, such as jewellery, ornaments and coins, as collateral. Financial products like gold ETFs, mutual funds, or digital gold are excluded. This distinction aims to keep volatility in check and lending standards robust.","Banks may now accept household gold and silver as collateral for loans under Rs 2 lakh, provided the pledge is voluntary.

Mexico tariffs : 'Not enough' done to stop cartels

EU tariffs: ‘Far from reciprocal’

Trump's 'no tariff' conditions

US President Donald Trump announced on Saturday that starting August 1, 2025, goods imported from both Mexico and the European Union will be subject to a 30% tariff.The letters, posted on his social media platform, cite drug trafficking concerns in Mexico and long-standing trade imbalances with the EU as reasons for the sweeping measures.Days earlier, Trump had intensified global trade tensions by issuing tariff warning letters to over 20 nations, cautioning that elevated import duties will come into effect from August 1, 2025, unless new bilateral trade agreements are secured.These nations included Japan, South Korea, and South Africa of potential tariffs ranging between 25% and 40%. Later he expanded the list by sending letters to eight additional countries, announcing new tariff rates: Brazil (50%), the Philippines (20%), Brunei (25%), Moldova (25%), Algeria (30%), Libya (30%), Iraq (30%), and Sri Lanka (30%).Addressing Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, Trump said the United States could no longer ignore Mexico’s failure to fully stop the flow of fentanyl and other narcotics into the country. While acknowledging that while it had been helping “secure the border,” he insisted, “what Mexico has done is not enough.”“Mexico still has not stopped the Cartels who are trying to turn all of North America into a Narco-Trafficking Playground.Obviously, I cannot let that happen!” Trump wrote.As a result from August 1, all Mexican goods entering the US will face a 30% tariff, in addition to any existing sector-specific levies. Trump also warned against efforts to bypass the tariff system through transshipment, noting that such goods would “be subject to that higher Tariff.”Trump also hinted at broader frustrations, writing, “The flow of Fentanyl is hardly the only challenge we have with Mexico, which has many Tariff, and Non-Tariff, Policies and Trade Barriers, which cause unsustainable Trade Deficits against the United States.”In the letter to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, Trump expressed frustration over persistent trade deficits with the EU. “Our relationship has been, unfortunately, far from Reciprocal,” he wrote, accusing the bloc of long-standing protectionist policies.""We have had years to discuss our Trading Relationship with The European Union, and have concluded that we must move away from these long-term, large, and persistent, Trade Deficits, engendered by your Tariff, and Non- Tariff, Policies and Trade Barriers.""From August 1, a 30% tariff will apply to all EU products entering the US, separate from other sector-specific tariffs. Trump noted that while the new rate is “far less than what is needed” to close the trade gap, it is a first step toward “balanced and fair TRADE.”He also cautioned against retaliation, “If for any reason you decide to raise your Tariffs and retaliate, then, whatever the number you choose to raise them by, will be added onto the 30% that we charge.”He said that the 30% figure is still lower than what is required to “eliminate the Trade Deficit disparity we have with the EU.”In both letters, Trump framed the tariffs as a correction of economic “injustices” that pose “a major threat to our Economy and, indeed, our National Security.”In the letters, Trump also mentioned that there “will be no tariff” in case the EU and Mexico or the companies within decide to manufacture in the US, assuring that the country will assist in getting quick approvals for the same.He wrote, that in case there is a decision “to build or manufacture product within the United States and, in fact, we will do everything possible to get approvals quickly, professionally, and routinely-In other words, in a matter of weeks.”","US President Donald Trump announced on Saturday that starting August 1, 2025, goods imported from both Mexico and the European Union will be subject to a 30% tariff.

US stocks retreated from record highs on Friday as President Donald Trump ’s aggressive tariff warning against Canada reignited investor concerns over global trade frictions. The S&P 500 slipped 0.3% by midday, a day after hitting a fresh all-time high, and looked set to record its first weekly loss in three weeks.The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 331 points, or 0.7%, while the Nasdaq composite edged 0.1% lower. Treasury yields also climbed, with the 10-year yield rising to 4.41% from 4.34%, AP reported.The sharp pullback followed Trump’s announcement of a 35% tariff on Canadian goods, formalised through a letter to Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney. The move intensified tensions with one of the US’s closest trade partners and added fresh uncertainty to Wall Street’s outlook.The White House has now extended the deadline for new trade agreements to August 1. Only two deals — with the UK and Vietnam — have been finalised since April, despite threats of steep tariffs. Trump also floated a 200% levy on imported pharmaceuticals this week and imposed a 50% tariff on copper, mirroring rates on steel and aluminium.Despite a relatively muted market reaction, some analysts remain cautious. “Markets appear to believe that Trump will again back down,” said Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics.“We are not so sure.”Investors are also turning their attention to the upcoming earnings season. Levi Strauss shares surged 9.2% after the apparel company beat estimates and raised its full-year guidance, even as it flagged higher costs from tariffs. PriceSmart rose 4.6% after strong Q3 results and plans to expand into Chile.The earnings calendar picks up next week, with major banks such as JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Citigroup set to report on Tuesday. According to FactSet, S&P 500 earnings are expected to grow 5% in Q2 — the slowest pace since Q4 of 2023.Financials, healthcare and communication services weighed on the broader market Friday. Visa fell 2.4%, Gilead Sciences slid 3.7%, and Meta was down 1%. Nvidia bucked the trend, rising 1.2% as it continued its momentum following its $4 trillion valuation.Airline stocks, which rallied Thursday after Delta’s upbeat results, reversed course. Delta fell 1.9%, while United and American Airlines each dropped 4.2%.T-Mobile shed 0.7% after the Justice Department cleared its $4.4 billion acquisition of U.S. Cellular. The latter’s shares rose 3.2% following the antitrust green light.In a notable defence-sector move, Red Cat Holdings rallied 19.8% after US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered an expansion in drone production and deployment.Globally, European indices were broadly lower, while Asian markets closed mixed.

Meme coins like Pudgy, Dogecoin, and Useless are lighting up trader dashboards again with short-term pumps and viral buzz. But behind the memes, a deeper conversation is emerging.Some investors are now looking beyond the hype for projects with real-world use and long-term staying power. One serious contender is starting to dominate that conversation offering something meme coins simply can’t, which is actual utility and 100x potential.Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) may have started as a feel-good meme coin, but traders are now watching it with mixed emotions. The token slid 7.21% in the last 24 hours to $0.01515, with trading volume also down 21%.Despite this dip, its market cap remains just shy of $1 billion, hinting that interest hasn’t fully faded. On the weekly chart, PENGU still clings to its broader uptrend but barely. Some analysts say it’s now at a technical crossroads, where either renewed meme momentum kicks in or short-term holders begin to rotate out.With speculation swirling around the next 100x play, some traders are starting to question if tokens like Pudgy can hold ground against more grounded, utility-first projects.Dogecoin is making noise again with a 6.6% jump, lifting it to $0.1743 and pushing daily trading volume past $1.2 billion. Whale activity and retail momentum appear to be fueling this short-term breakout, but DOGE is still stuck inside a long-running descending wedge.Despite the rally, its multi-year support at $0.13 remains the true backbone of its price structure. Meme traders may love the action, but real growth lies elsewhere.Useless Coin has taken irony to the bank. Up over 77% this week and nearly 250% in the past month, it’s turned “no utility” into a rallying cry. Priced near $0.29 with a $300 million market cap, the coin continues to ride a wave of memes, momentum and mischief.Traders clearly aren’t betting on fundamentals here; they're leaning into the joke. With strong volume and a chart full of higher highs, USELESS could nudge past $0.30 if the hype holds.Still, it walks a tightrope.

UK economy worries: May GDP contracts 0.1% for second straight month; BoE rate cut seen likely amid fiscal strain,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/uk-economy-may-gdp-dips-0-1-for-second-straight-month-boe-rate-cut-likely-amid-fiscal-pressure/articleshow/122386231.cms,"Britain’s economy contracted for the second consecutive month in May, dealing a blow to finance minister Rachel Reeves as she navigates a shaky domestic recovery and heightened global uncertainty. Official figures released on Friday showed that gross domestic product (GDP) declined 0.1% in May, following a 0.3% drop in April.The latest reading came as a surprise to economists polled by Reuters, who had expected a 0.1% increase in GDP. While the services sector managed a marginal gain, declines in industrial output and construction dragged overall growth into negative territory, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said.The data casts doubt on whether the economy expanded in the second quarter of 2025, and has strengthened expectations that the Bank of England (BoE) will cut interest rates next month. “The lack of momentum in the UK economy indicated by these sluggish figures means that an August interest rate cut currently looks inevitable, despite the recent spike in inflation,” said Suren Thiru, economics director at accountancy body ICAEW.Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s Labour government, which took office earlier this year, has yet to deliver a meaningful boost to growth. Economists say finance minister Reeves may now be forced to consider tax hikes in her next budget, despite earlier hopes to avoid them.“While today’s figures are disappointing, I am determined to kickstart economic growth and deliver on that promise,” Reeves said in response to the ONS release.Britain had posted a strong performance in the first quarter of 2025, outpacing other G7 economies. In May, the BoE raised its full-year growth forecast to 1%. However, much of the Q1 surge was attributed to temporary factors — including a rush to close home purchases before the expiry of a tax break in April and accelerated exports to beat rising US tariffs.The BoE estimates second-quarter GDP growth at around 0.25%. To meet that target, the ONS said, June would need to show at least flat monthly growth, assuming no revisions to previous months. A contraction of 0.4% or more in June would result in a quarterly decline.“The second straight decline in monthly real GDP in May will increase concerns that the government’s growth plan has been derailed by external and domestic shocks,” said Raj Badiani, economics director for Europe at S&P Global Market Intelligence, quoted Reuters.","Britain's economy contracted for the second consecutive month in May.

Trade deals between the US and China are moving at a pace slower than expected, which may lead to extensions of the current tariff deadlines, according to a report by SBI Funds Management.The report highlighted deadlock amidst ongoing trade talks between both the nations with both sides showing limited progress in finalising a deal. The report points at a critical standby in global supply of rare earth metals which may get affected owing to China’s domination in supplying 90% of the global capacity, reported ANI.China’s dominance over rare earth metals could prove detrimental for global automobile industry, especially electric vehicle production in the US, Europe, and India.China on Tuesday responded to Trump administration’s renewed tariff plans with warning of potential retaliatory measures.Beijing also indicated that it may also take action against countries that align with Washington's efforts to marginalize China within global supply chains. The warning was published as a part of an official commentary in People’s Daily. The article called the US tariff strategy, labeling it “bullying,” and argued that “dialogue and cooperation are the only correct path”, reported by Reuters.The 90-day pause for trade negotiations which was initially set to end on July 9, has been extended to August 1. Trump has escalated trade tensions by sending tariff letters to more than 20 countries, warning that higher import duties will take effect from August 1, 2025 if bilateral trade deals are not reached.","Trade deals between the US and China are moving at a pace slower than expected, which may lead to extensions of the current tariff deadlines.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021.

Startups will play important role in helping India become 3rd largest economy: CEA Nageswaran,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/startups-will-play-important-role-in-helping-india-become-3rd-largest-economy-cea-nageswaran/articleshow/105332523.cms,"Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor ( CEA ) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran Udaan until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.Udaan built an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business still accounts for a very small part of India’s overall retail market but can balloon to $150 billion in sales and yield a 100% return on capital invested in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co. estimates published in the Mint newspaper.Bengaluru-based Udaan has also ventured into financing through its fintech unit which helps shopkeepers get working capital loans to buy inventory. That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says.

SAR imagery provides much higher resolution than other forms of remote sensing technology such as hyperspectral and multispectral. SAR is a critical technology for strategic reconnaissance and planning as well as for disaster management.According to Misra, winning the challenge in just over a year of floating the company is a major booster.He said L and P band SAR have an advantage over other frequencies (like X band) when it comes to penetration capabilities through rain, clouds, foliage and vegetation in a tropical country like India, and underground penetration capabilities in dry terrain.Continuing further, he said the L band SAR will provide 1 metre resolution, spotlight resolution in Stripmap mode. The current industry standard is 5-10 metre in L band. Misra said both the L and P band will operate simultaneously from a satellite borne SAR.

S&P 500 gains even as Dow drops on healthcare and chip sector woes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-stock-market-sp-500-dow-jones-unitedhealth-scrutiny-nasdaq/articleshow/120383334.cms,"Photo- AP

Wall Street is drifting between gains and losses Thursday as UnitedHealth Group’s stock plunges toward its worst drop in more than a quarter century, while most of the rest of the US stock market ticks higher.The S&P 500 was up 0.7% in its final day of trading in a holiday-shortened week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 287 points, or 0.7%, as of 1:02 p.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite was 0.2% higher.UnitedHealth was the heaviest force dragging on the market, and its stock tumbled 21.9% toward its worst day since 1998.The health care giant reported profit and revenue for the latest quarter that fell short of analysts’ expectations, and it also slashed its forecast for financial results this year. It was surprised by how much care its Medicare Advantage customers were getting from doctors and outpatient services, which was above the company’s expectations.Another high-profile stock, Nvidia, also dragged on the market after sinking a second straight day following its disclosure that new export limits on chips to China could hurt its first-quarter results by $5.5 billion. It sank 2.8% and was the second-heaviest weight on the S&P 500.But a wide majority of stocks across Wall Street were nevertheless rising, including more than four out of every five within the S&P 500 index. Technology stocks held steadier following their sell-off from the day before after global heavyweight Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. reported a profit for the latest quarter that matched analysts’ expectations.Perhaps more importantly, it also said it hasn’t seen a drop-off in activity from its customers because of President Donald Trump ’s trade war, as some other companies have suggested.Still, the company known as TSMC was cautious. “While we have not seen any changes in our customers’ behavior so far, uncertainties and risks from the potential impact from tariff policies exist,” Chief Financial Officer Wendell Huang said. TSMC’s stock that trades in the United States rose 1.1%.Eli Lilly was another winner after the drugmaker reported encouraging results for a once-daily pill that could help treat people with obesity and diabetes. Its stock jumped 15.9%.Exxon Mobil rose 3.7%, and ConocoPhillips rallied 4.2% as oil prices rose to recover some of their sharp losses taken this month amid worries that the trade war could hurt the global economy.Meanwhile, the US bond market remained relatively calm after last week’s volatility, which had stirred fears over waning global confidence in US assets amid escalating trade tensions. Global stock markets moved in divergent directions on Thursday as investors weighed a looming interest rate cut by the European Central Bank against escalating tensions between US President Donald Trump and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell European indices declined in midday trading, pulling back from earlier gains in Asia. London’s FTSE 100 was down 0.7 percent at 8,218.19, Paris' CAC 40 slipped 0.8 percent to 7,268.90, and Frankfurt’s DAX dropped 0.6 percent to 21,178.14.In contrast, Asian markets closed mostly higher, buoyed by optimism surrounding Japan-US trade talks. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 surged 1.4 percent to 34,377.60, the Hang Seng Index in Hong Kong rose 1.6 percent to 21,395.14, and Shanghai's Composite Index edged up 0.1 percent to 3,280.34.Meanwhile, safe-haven gold hit a new record above $3,357.78 an ounce, while oil prices and the US dollar posted modest gains. Brent crude rose 1.0 percent to $66.51 per barrel and West Texas Intermediate increased 1.2 percent to $62.55.Market sentiment remained cautious as President Trump renewed criticism of Fed Chairman Powell , accusing him of failing to match the ECB’s monetary easing and calling for his dismissal. Trump's comments followed Powell's warning that the administration’s broad-based tariffs could leave the central bank with difficult choices between curbing inflation and preserving employment.The warning, along with chipmaker Nvidia's disclosure of mounting costs from the ongoing US-China trade war, triggered a sharp selloff on Wall Street. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 1.7 percent at 39,669.39.Trump responded Thursday by slamming Powell's leadership, stating his “termination cannot come fast enough.”Attention is now firmly on the ECB, which is widely expected to lower interest rates in response to economic uncertainty stoked by protectionist trade policies and slowing global growth.Investors are also monitoring developments in Washington, where governments are scrambling to secure trade agreements before Trump's recently announced tariffs — delayed for 90 days — come into effect. On social media, the president said there had been “Big Progress!” in talks with Japanese officials, a sentiment echoed by Tokyo’s envoy Ryosei Akazawa.Japan’s Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba acknowledged the complexity of the negotiations but reaffirmed both sides' urgency to reach a resolution.","The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 287 points, or 0.7%, as of 1:02 p.m. Eastern time.

‘Uncertainty is costly’

'A more level playing field'

The head of the International Monetary Fund IMF ) said Thursday that the world economy is likely to avoid a recession despite mounting global trade tensions sparked by US President Donald Trump ’s sweeping tariffs . However, the cost of these trade disruptions will be significant, IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva warned.Speaking to reporters in Washington ahead of next week’s Spring Meetings of the IMF and World Bank, Georgieva said the Fund expects ""notable"" markdowns to global growth, though not a contraction.“Trade disruptions incur costs,” Georgieva said, referencing recent market volatility driven by Trump’s stop-start tariff rollout, which has triggered the sharpest swings since the COVID-19 pandemic, as reported AFP.“This is a reminder that we live in a world of sudden and sweeping shifts,” she said in prepared remarks. “And it is a call to respond wisely.”Georgieva’s comments suggest the IMF will revise down its earlier global growth forecast of 3.3 percent for both 2025 and 2026 in its upcoming World Economic Outlook, due next Tuesday.Georgieva outlined three major risks from rising trade barriers , particularly for smaller advanced economies and emerging markets that are heavily reliant on global trade.“First, uncertainty is costly,” she said. “It becomes difficult for business to make plans if they do not know how much their inputs will cost in the future.”“Second, rising trade barriers hit growth upfront,” she said. “Tariffs, like all taxes, raise revenue at the expense of reducing and shifting activity.”Her third point warned that “protectionism erodes productivity over the long run, especially in smaller economies.”Georgieva called on countries to take corrective steps at home by adjusting fiscal policy to lower debt and ensuring central bank independence is preserved through “agile and credible” monetary policy.Georgieva also outlined country-specific challenges, calling on China to boost domestic consumption and shift away from a state-driven, export-heavy growth model. For the United States, she urged authorities to put surging public debt “on a declining path.”As for the European Union, the IMF chief emphasized the need to enhance competitiveness by “deepening the single market.”“In trade policy, the goal must be to secure a settlement among the largest players that preserves openness and delivers a more level playing field,” she said.Her remarks underscore the IMF’s longstanding position in favor of free trade and open markets, even as global economies grapple with rising protectionism.“We need a more resilient world economy, not a drift to division,” Georgieva added. “And, to facilitate the transition, policies must allow private agents time to adjust and deliver.”","IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said the Fund expects ""notable"" markdowns to global growth, though not a contraction.

BENGALURU: Infosys terminated 240 trainees at its Mysuru campus after they failed to clear an internal assessment. This decision came after the trainees were given three attempts to qualify. The company gave them ample preparation time and arranged several mock assessments and doubt-clearing sessions. Despite these efforts, the trainees were unable to meet the required standards. This marks the third instance of such terminations at the IT firm's Mysuru facility in recent times.In Feb, Infosys terminated around 350 freshers after they failed to clear internal assessments. In March, the company dismissed 45 trainees for the same reason.On completing a separation and general release agreement, the company said it will offer one month's salary, a relieving letter, and a 12-week training programme for potential roles in the BPM sector. Infosys has also partnered with NIIT and UpGrad to assist the affected trainees by sponsoring their training programmes to prepare them for future openings in the BPM industry.","Trainees were given three attempts to qualify.

Cutting costs amid dull demand

BENGALURU: For over two decades, IT companies have been the biggest hirers of engineering and technology talent. However, amid uncertainty, IT companies are treading cautiously when it comes to workforce expansion. With increased adoption of AI and automation, there is greater focus on productivity.The top three Indian IT firms added 1,438 employees during the March quarter, reversing a decline of 936 in headcount in the Dec quarter. TCS added 625 people, while Infosys and Wipro added 199 and 614 employees, respectively, during Q4.However, the top five Indian IT firms saw a collective net headcount reduction of 2,587 in the Dec quarter, contrasting sharply with the Sept quarter's addition of 15,033 employees.IT firms are bracing for a bleak hiring forecast due to the overhang of macroeconomic headwinds reshaping demand environment, leading to a dent in the job market. Firms are proceeding with caution, stressing the current climate necessitates prudent workforce planning and cost-efficiency measures. For FY25, the combined net headcount addition of TCS, Infosys, and Wipro was 13,503 compared to a decline of 64,000 people in the previous year.TCS EVP & CHRO Milind Lakkad said that the business environment will influence the firm's decision on net additions. ""We'll continue to hire from campuses, and it will be similar to last year's numbers. With respect to net additions, it depends on the overall business environment and what we eventually hire in the market,"" he said.Wipro CHRO Saurabh Govil said his company has adopted a prudent campus hiring strategy. ""We burnt our fingers three years back. So, we are very conscious that we do it the right way,"" he said.Ramkumar Ramamoorthy, partner at tech growth advisory firm Catalincs, said, ""In the new era of growth driven by AI, platforms, and third-party software sales, hiring metrics are increasingly losing relevance.""Phil Fersht, CEO of US-based HfS Research, said there is considerable focus across major IT services firms to keep costs to a minimum and maximise current resources. ""This hiring metric is very relevant to the changing times. The services firms are looking to incorporate current staff plus AI as opposed to the traditional model of hiring freshers and new staff to bolster growth,"" he said.India's tech sector hired 1,26,000 people in FY25, taking the total talent base to 5.8 million. Nasscom restated that it hired 90,000 employees during the year-ago period, taking the tally to 5.6 million. This comes at a time when large IT firms are seeing a decline in headcount, and much of the net addition last year was on account of GCCs. ""This is perhaps the worst environment we have known for college graduates looking for jobs. With the current economic uncertainty, this slow hiring metric will continue to be flat, and I can see it staying this way throughout 2025,"" Fersht said.","IT firms are bracing for a bleak hiring forecast due to the overhang of macroeconomic headwinds reshaping demand environment.

'No settlement without backing of Byju's creditors',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/no-settlement-without-backing-of-byjus-creditors/articleshow/120421942.cms,"BENGALURU: The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal dismissed attempts by Byju's founder Byju Reveendran's brother Riju Ravindran and cricket body BCCI to withdraw insolvency proceedings against the edtech firm without creditor approval. This decision reinforces the authority of the committee of creditors (CoC) in the corporate insolvency case.NCLAT upheld an earlier decision by the Bengaluru bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), which declined to immediately approve the out-of-court settlement between BCCI and Byju's. The appellate tribunal stated that since the settlement proposal came after the formation of the CoC, it cannot proceed without the consent of 90% of the creditor group, in line with Sec 12A of Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code The CoC includes GLAS Trust, a US-based trustee representing lenders to whom Byju's owes $1.2 billion, and Aditya Birla Finance. Based on admitted claims, GLAS Trust holds a 99.4% voting share in the committee.The case stems from a sponsorship dispute involving BCCI, which filed an insolvency plea last year over unpaid dues of Rs 158.9 crore tied to a 2019 team sponsorship agreement.Though NCLAT briefly stayed insolvency proceedings in Aug 2024 after a settlement was proposed, that ruling was overturned by the SC in Oct following objections from GLAS Trust.The lender alleged that the funds offered for settlement by Ravindran were questionable and should be directed toward broader debt obligations.Ravindran and BCCI argued that their withdrawal application was submitted before the CoC was formed. However, the tribunal found that Form FA - the official application for withdrawal - was filed on Nov 14, 2024, by which time the CoC had already been constituted. As a result, the application triggers mandatory creditor consent.","Byju's founder Byju Reveendran's brother Riju Ravindran and cricket body BCCI tried to withdraw insolvency proceedings against the edtech firm without creditor approval.

Indonesian coffee chain may brew price war,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/indonesian-coffee-chain-may-brew-price-war/articleshow/120421932.cms,"Representative Image

MUMBAI: Global coffee giants Starbucks and Tim Hortons have a new competitor in India - Asian rival Kopi Kenangan . The Indonesian brand, valued at over $1 billion, plans to capitalise on the growing cafe culture in the country with pricing lower than its competitors and a menu localised to cater to the Indian palate.""For any retail brand, it would be such a waste if you miss the train in India,"" Edward Tirtanata, co-founder and group CEO at Kenangan Brands, told TOI. The company is backed by Peak XV Partners and Meta co-founder Eduardo Saverin's B Capital.A huge population, expanding economy, and significant purchasing power in metros like Delhi, Mumbai, and Bengaluru provide enough room for new entrants to have a play in the market despite a growing mix of global and local coffee chains in the country, said Tirtanata. For India, where the cafe market is still nascent compared to other Asian countries, the brand has priced its menu cheaper than the rate at which it sells in other markets like Singapore and Australia, Tirtanata said.Besides global brands like Starbucks, Tim Hortons and Pret A Manger, a new crop of home-grown brands like Third Wave Coffee and Blue Tokai Coffee Roasters are expanding in the local market alongside traditional chains Barista and Cafe Coffee Day.C CD, which ushered in the cafe culture in the country in the 90s, lost ground to rivals weighed down by huge debt and financial troubles. The company has been reducing its store count.In India, where socialising over a cup of coffee or tea is a popular culture, QSR brands McDonald's and KFC are also competing for a share of the coffee space through their offerings.Kopi Kenangan's pricing in the market, which is largely led by students, young Gen Z, and millennials, many of whom are also in their first jobs and may look for cheaper options, starts at Rs 99 for an Espresso shot and under Rs 150 for bigger servings, lower by about Rs 80-100 than what Starbucks and local chains like Blue Tokai offer. ""Our price points are far more accessible than other international chains. We are positioned well within a gap that exists in the Indian market,"" said Tirtanata.Its strategy to source most ingredients locally has partly helped the company to keep its pricing low. Sluggish consumer demand amid high inflation over the past few quarters weighed on brands like Starbucks, which slowed store expansion. Kopi Kenangan, which launched in Delhi earlier this month, plans to enter Mumbai and Bengaluru in the next couple of years.","Kopi Kenangan plans to capitalise on the growing cafe culture in the country.

Possible signs of life

99.7% chance

Planet K2-18b

'Alien world'

Astronomers from the University of Cambridge have uncovered promising signs that a planet orbiting a distant star could be home to life, reports BBC.The planet, K2-18b , lies a staggering 700 trillion miles away, yet powerful observations from Nasa’s James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) are bringing it into scientific focus like never before.The team, led by Nikku Madhusudhan , detected chemical traces in the atmosphere of K2-18b that, on Earth, are only made by simple life forms such as plankton and bacteria. Their study has now been published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters .Using JWST, which can analyse starlight as it filters through a planet’s atmosphere, the researchers found what appears to be a chemical signature of two molecules: dimethyl sulphide (DMS) and dimethyl disulphide (DMDS). On Earth, these gases are only produced by marine microorganisms.“The amount we estimate of this gas in the atmosphere is thousands of times higher than what we have on Earth,” said Madhusudhan. “So, if the association with life is real, then this planet will be teeming with life.”He added: “If we confirm that there is life on K2-18b, it should basically confirm that life is very common in the galaxy.”The detection currently stands at a “three sigma” confidence level—meaning there’s a 99.7% chance the signal is real. That may sound impressive, but to claim a proper scientific discovery, the result must reach “five sigma,” or 99.99994% certainty.This is a major step up from the team's earlier result 18 months ago, which was only at one sigma.Madhusudhan remains optimistic: “This is the strongest evidence yet there is possibly life out there. I can realistically say that we can confirm this signal within one to two years.”K2-18b is around 2.5 times the size of Earth and orbits a cool red star. Some scientists believe it may have a vast ocean of liquid water beneath its thick atmosphere, which would be ideal for life.Others have different ideas. According to the study published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters, one theory says the missing ammonia in the atmosphere might have been absorbed by a huge ocean of water. But molten rock could also absorb ammonia, which would mean the planet may not support life at all.Nicolas Wogan at Nasa’s Ames Research Center has offered another theory altogether, suggesting K2-18b might be a mini gas giant with no surface—an environment inhospitable to life.To strengthen their case, Madhusudhan's team is now working with other researchers to test whether the gases DMS and DMDS could also be produced through non-living processes. That’s because it's still difficult to say if such chemicals definitely mean life.“On Earth it is produced by microorganisms in the ocean,” said Catherine Heymans, Scotland’s Astronomer Royal, “but even with perfect data we can't say for sure that this is of a biological origin on an alien world because loads of strange things happen in the Universe.”(This is a top Google Trends topic)","Astronomers from the University of Cambridge have uncovered promising signs that a planet orbiting a distant star could be home to life.

Top stock market recommendations Nifty has covered over 1700 points from its opening low printed on last Monday, in a matter of 5 sessions. The index is now on the verge of turning positive again for the month as it is still few points in the red on an MTD basis. This double bottom bounce back has been stronger than its last month’s recovery from sub 22000 levels as the market digests a rut cut by the RBI along with easing trade war tensions by US with other countries of the world. With reclamation of 22800-22900 zone on a closing basis the index has turned back to a buy on dip for the medium term and is eyeing to scale back above 24000. There is a gap between 23200 – 22900 on daily charts which can be used as the range to buy on dip for the forthcoming leg upside.Bank Nifty has been the star outperformer in this ongoing correction while the index has broadly held on to its wide range from the start of this calendar year.With tariff fears creating a strong set back on global markets, its impact on Indian indices also pulled leading indices back to its March 2025 lows. However, Bank Nifty stood out strongly, reversing after a 61.8% retracement. We had highlighted a buy on dip level between 49900 and 50400 for targets of 52500 on the upside. This has been complete as of today while the outperformance on Bank Nifty v/s Nifty looks overbought in the short term. With the index now at 4 month high, a consolidation here between 51800 – 53200 looks possible with Nifty now taking charge for upside.IRCTC has given a breakout from a falling trendline which has been in place for the past 10 months now. Adding to this, stock has also closed at a 2 month high on daily charts confirming the end of this 10 month long correction seen on the scrip. Though this breakout allows a based formation and higher targets for the medium term on this monopoly scrip, for now we are looking at a quick 8-10% upside.QSR stocks had been sliding since the start of this calendar year. Marking an end to the slide, Jubilant FoodWorks has given a breakout of a 3 month long correction while making a higher bottom formation all through the past 4 weeks. A quick 6-8% upside follows through this breakout on the stock.Stocks making highs in a market crash, are generally the ones witnessing significant flows and lesser outflows in comparison to the widely traded names. Current strength seen on Shree Cement is likely to extend for another 8-10% given the market reversal being formed on charts. A support seen at yesterday’s low is an ideal risk reward to be played for the upside. Stock is likely to breakout to new all time highs.","According to Aakash K Hindocha, Deputy Vice President - WM Research, IRCTC, Jubilant FoodWorks and Shree Cement are the top buy calls for today. Nifty has covered over 1700 points from its opening low printed on last Monday, in a matter of 5 sessions.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120354425,imgsize-92166,width-400,resizemode-4/120354425.jpg"

'Came as little surprise'

Delayed stimulus, immediate shock

The European Central Bank (ECB) cut interest rates by a quarter-point on Thursday, citing growing risks to eurozone growth from US President Donald Trump ’s erratic tariff policy. The move marked the sixth consecutive rate cut by the central bank.The latest decision brings the ECB’s benchmark deposit rate down to 2.25 percent, its lowest level since early 2023, news agency AFP reported.Rate cuts have been a part of the ECB’s strategy to steer inflation back toward its two-percent target, and although inflation has shown signs of aligning with that goal, concerns over a deteriorating growth outlook prompted further easing.“The outlook for growth has deteriorated owing to rising trade tensions,” the ECB noted in a statement, pointing to the potential economic fallout from the US's shifting trade stance.The bank had initially signalled a pause in its rate-cutting cycle following its March meeting, but Trump’s surprise unveiling of wide-ranging “Liberation Day” tariffs in early April — followed by a sudden 90-day suspension for several countries, including the EU — appeared to have changed the calculus.“This cut came as little surprise,” said Carsten Brzeski, analyst at ING Bank. He added that the ECB’s previously “measured” approach now risked “falling behind the curve once again” as uncertainty grows.Besides a blanket 10 percent tariff on imports into the US, the Trump administration has slapped 25 percent levies on cars, steel, and aluminum — sectors heavily linked to European exports. The White House has also launched probes into semiconductors and pharmaceuticals, raising the specter of further industry-specific tariffs.Going into Thursday’s meeting, ECB officials were left with no clear sense of what long-term trade conditions would look like for transatlantic commerce. The ECB said it faced “exceptional uncertainty” and would adopt a “data-dependent and meeting-by-meeting” stance going forward.The current environment is “likely to reduce confidence among households and firms,” the ECB noted, adding that financial conditions could tighten further amid market tensions.Analysts at UniCredit said that, in this context, another rate cut to alleviate pressure on consumers and businesses was a “straightforward” decision. They added that the negative impact of Trump’s tariff escalation would likely outweigh the positive effect of upcoming stimulus in Germany.Berlin’s incoming government under Friedrich Merz has announced large-scale fiscal spending for defense and infrastructure. However, economists warn the boost would only materialize in 2026, while the economic shock from trade disruptions would be far more immediate.On inflation, Robert Greil, strategist at Merck Finck private bank, said US tariffs could lead to “a further decline in inflation in the eurozone,” which stood at 2.2 percent in March — down sharply from the double-digit highs of late 2022.The strengthening of the euro against the dollar should also help ease import costs, and higher tariffs on Chinese goods could result in cheaper alternatives flowing into Europe, Greil said.Markets now await ECB President Christine Lagarde's post-announcement remarks for more insight into the bank’s forward guidance. Lagarde has previously indicated the ECB remains prepared to act if Trump’s trade war spills into financial instability.“The ECB is always ready to use the instruments that it has available,” Lagarde said last week in Warsaw.",The European Central Bank (ECB) cut interest rates by a quarter-point on Thursday.

US investors to offload $800 billion of China equities? Goldman Sachs warns of 'extreme scenario' amid escalating trade war,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-investors-to-offload-800-billion-of-china-equities-goldman-sachs-warns-of-extreme-scenario-amid-escalating-trade-war/articleshow/120375791.cms,"AI-genrated image

US-China trade war: Could India win be the winner amid the conflict of world's two biggest economies?

US investors may reportedly be forced to divest approximately $800 billion of Chinese equities ""in an extreme scenario"" if financial separation occurs between the world's largest economies, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc.Presently, US institutions hold roughly 7% of Chinese companies' American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) market capitalisation, with limited Hong Kong trading capabilities. Goldman analysts, led by Kinger Lau, noted in a Wednesday report quoted by Bloomberg that these investors might face difficulties acquiring shares in Hong Kong if companies such as Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. face involuntary US delisting.Goldman has joined other international banks in evaluating worst-case scenarios for investors amid growing US-China financial separation concerns. The possibility of American exchanges removing Chinese companies, first raised during Donald Trump's presidency, has re-emerged following Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent's statement that all options remain ""on the table"" in China trade negotiations The analysts highlighted unprecedented uncertainty in global trading, resulting in significant market volatility and worries about worldwide recession. They project that forced delisting could lead to 9 per cent and 4 per cent valuation decreases in ADRs and the MSCI China Index, respectively. US institutional investors currently possess Chinese ADRs worth $250 billion, representing 26 per cent of total market value, Goldman reports, as per Bloomberg.Their Hong Kong stock holdings amount to $522 billion (16% of market total), whilst maintaining 0.5% of China's A shares, totalling over $800 billion in Chinese equities.Goldman calculates that US investors could exit A shares within one day, whilst requiring 119 days for Hong Kong stocks and 97 days for ADRs. In this scenario, Chinese investors might need to sell US financial assets worth $1.7 trillion, comprising $370 billion in equities and $1.3 trillion in bonds.Amid the looming threat, the Kraneshares CSI China Internet Fund, America's largest China-focused ETF (Exchange-traded fund), faces significant risk from forced liquidation due to ADR delisting, according to Goldman. The fund maintains 33 per cent ADR weighting, half lacking Hong Kong listings, with 72 per cent US investor ownership.JPMorgan Chase & Co. had previously estimated that ADR delistings could trigger global index removals, potentially causing passive outflows of approximately $11 billion.The escalating US-China trade war, marked by Trump’s imposition of up to 245% tariffs on Chinese imports, has created significant global disruption but also a potential opportunity for India. As the US targets China’s tech, minerals, and consumer goods sectors, India’s minimal trade exposure—just 2.7 per cent of US imports—shields it from direct impact, allowing it to emerge as a neutral and scalable manufacturing alternative. While Beijing has responded with retaliatory duties and tighter export controls, India has maintained a non-retaliatory, conciliatory stance, seeking closer trade engagement with the US instead.This strategic posture, combined with India’s $26 billion in manufacturing incentives under the 'Make in India' campaign, is drawing renewed global interest. Apple Inc., for example, has significantly expanded its India operations, assembling $22 billion worth of iPhones in the year ending March—a 60% increase over the previous year. In March alone, nearly $2 billion worth of iPhones were airlifted from India to the US to bypass looming tariffs. India now assembles all iPhone models, including premium variants, and exported $17.4 billion worth in FY25, with its share of global iPhone production poised to hit 30%.Amid these shifts, Chinese firms are also reassessing their India strategies. Facing mounting tariffs and reduced access to the US market, companies like Shanghai Highly and Haier have shown increased willingness to comply with Indian regulations. They are now open to minority ownership in joint ventures and technology-sharing agreements—terms they previously resisted. Shanghai Highly, for instance, renewed talks with Voltas and formed a technical collaboration with PG Electroplast, while Haier is negotiating to sell a majority stake in its local operations.Despite the momentum, India’s structural challenges remain. Manufacturing accounts for less than 13 per cent of its economy, down from 15 per cent, and industries still depend heavily on Chinese inputs and foreign machinery. Businesses also face hurdles such as a shortage of skilled labor, expensive land, limited credit, and bureaucratic red tape. These constraints could limit India’s ability to fully capitalize on the shifting trade dynamics.Still, global sentiment is tilting in India’s favor. Foreign investors have poured $25 billion into Indian markets this year, and the Nifty 50 has rebounded strongly, outpacing markets hit by tariff shocks. With Apple leading the way and more firms eyeing India as a de-risking destination, the country stands well-positioned to gain from the US-China standoff. If it can address its internal bottlenecks, India may indeed turn this moment of global tension into a long-term manufacturing breakthrough.","US investors may be forced to divest approximately $800 billion of Chinese equities ""in an extreme scenario"" Goldman Sachs Group Inc. has joined other international banks in evaluating worst-case scenarios for investors amid growing US-China financial separation concerns.

Why it matters

Why China is at a disadvantage

1. Exports still power China’s economy

2. China is fighting from a weaker economic position

3. The domestic market can’t absorb the shock

4. The Communist Party’s legitimacy is at stake

5. Beijing lacks the agility of Trump’s trade policy

The looming question: which side may blink first

US President Donald Trump on Wednesday ratcheted up his tariff offensive up to 245% on China. He also declared it’s up to China to return to the negotiating table after Beijing backed out of a high-stakes Boeing aircraft deal. “The ball is in China’s court,” Trump said in a statement delivered by White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt. “China needs to make a deal with us. We don’t have to make a deal with them.”In reaction, China said it was “not afraid” of engaging in a trade war with the United States, while repeating its call for dialogue. “If the US really wants to resolve the issue through dialogue and negotiation, it should stop exerting extreme pressure, stop threatening and blackmailing, and talk to China on the basis of equality, respect and mutual benefit,” foreign ministry spokesman Lin Jian said.Despite China’s tough talk, it faces deeper economic vulnerabilities than the US, and a prolonged trade war could inflict lasting damage on its export-reliant economy. While both nations are absorbing shocks, the pain may be far more acute for Beijing — not least because of how much it still depends on American consumers.“They’ll run out of bullets first,” Trump reportedly told aides during his first administration.That sentiment is now being stress-tested as China grapples with a triple blow: Plunging exports, sluggish consumer demand, and a weak job market.Despite its rhetoric, Beijing is boxed in—economically, politically, and strategically. Here's why:Despite its attempts to diversify exports, China still remains deeply reliant on US markets. Exports account for nearly a third of its GDP, and up to 20% of that goes to the US when indirect trade routes are factored in. Goldman Sachs estimates that up to 20 million Chinese jobs depend on these exports. Beijing has talked for years about pivoting toward domestic consumption, but the reality is that its economy is still built to sell to the world—especially to America. A sudden collapse in US-bound trade will hit employment, growth, and local government revenue hard.China’s economy is already under stress—from deflation, a property market crisis, and weak private sector investment. Tariffs only deepen those vulnerabilities. While Q1 growth was 5.4%, much of that came from front-loading shipments to beat the tariff clock. Forecasts are already falling: Nomura cut its 2025 GDP estimate to 4%, UBS to 3.4%. China can’t afford another economic shock, especially one it didn’t initiate. Yet that’s exactly what this trade war is becoming. As per estimates, China's GDP growth may get a hit of about 2% if the trade war continues.Officials tout China’s 1.4 billion consumers as a buffer against trade shocks. But household confidence is fragile. Property prices are falling, youth unemployment is high, and consumer sentiment has yet to rebound post-Covid. People are saving, not spending. Many middle-class households already saw their wealth eroded through the real estate slump, and stimulus has only provided short-term relief. Domestic demand is not yet strong or stable enough to replace the loss of US market access.Unlike Washington, where economic pain can be chalked up to politics, China’s ruling party has no opposition to blame. The social contract in China hinges on stability and rising living standards. A prolonged trade war that drives unemployment up and incomes down could create unrest—and that’s politically dangerous for the leadership. Beijing may talk tough, but it knows that economic discontent can turn volatile fast, especially in urban centers where jobs are drying up.Ironically, Trump's trade war is easier to escalate than Beijing's. The US president can impose tariffs almost unilaterally-In contrast, China’s policymaking is bureaucratic and consensus-driven, even under Xi Jinping . It takes time to analyze, agree on, and implement countermeasures. That makes China slower to react and easier to corner. In trade diplomacy, speed and unpredictability are assets—and Trump has both.From the White House, the message is clear: Trump sees no need to compromise. Press secretary Leavitt repeated the president’s view that China “reneged” on a Boeing deal and failed to honor commitments under a previous trade agreement.“There’s no difference between China and any other country except they are much larger,” Leavitt said.Beijing disagrees — but behind its confident posture lies real concern. Chinese officials admit the new tariffs could “put certain pressures on our country’s foreign trade and economy,” said Sheng Laiyun of the National Bureau of Statistics.That pressure is already visible on factory floors.At the Canton Fair, a sprawling trade exhibition in Guangzhou, Chinese vendors shared frustration and fear. “This is so hard for us,” said Lionel Xu, whose mosquito repellent kits once filled US shelves. Now, they sit in a warehouse.China's messaging - both at home and abroad - is shifting between bravado and damage control.State media has leaned into national pride, urging people to “eat bitterness” and endure hardship. But that’s easier said than done in 2025, when more than half the Chinese population is now overweight, and urban living expectations have surged.The average Chinese consumer - especially the emerging middle class - isn’t eager to go backward. Add to that an already battered property sector and a soft job market, and the public appetite for pain may be limited.Even official optimism is hedged. China’s customs authority recently insisted that “the sky won’t fall,” but also highlighted the need to boost domestic consumption to offset losses from declining US trade.For now, both Trump and Xi Jinping are locked in a high-stakes faceoff. Trump’s rhetoric suggests he’s betting on economic attrition - expecting US voters to tolerate short-term inflation more easily than China can withstand a hit to its growth model.Still, the risk of political backlash at home is real. Soaring prices on Chinese-made goods - from umbrellas to electronics - could pinch American consumers. Democrats are already labeling Trump’s tariff strategy a “Trump sales tax” on working families.But China is more poorly positioned for a drawn-out trade war. Its economic vulnerabilities — from weak household demand to export dependence — are more severe than those in the US. Trump, unpredictable as ever, may yet reverse course. But unless he does, Beijing’s best option may not be escalation — it may be patience.(With inputs from agencies)","US President Donald Trump ratcheted up his tariff offensive up to 245% on China.

US Wall Street experienced a significant sell-off on Wednesday, accompanied by a declining dollar, following pessimistic remarks from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and concerns over semiconductor company Nvidia . The market atmosphere shifted from its previous stability, prompting investors to seek refuge in gold, which surpassed $3,300 per ounce.Despite positive retail sales figures, US equities declined. The downturn intensified after Powell expressed concerns about Trump's tariffs potentially forcing the Federal Reserve to make difficult decisions regarding inflation and unemployment management.Powell indicated that whilst employment and inflation objectives were currently balanced, policymakers might face a ""challenging scenario"" as circumstances evolve. ""Tariffs are highly likely to generate at least a temporary rise in inflation,"" Powell told the Economic Club of Chicago, warning that the inflationary effects ""could also be more persistent."" US stocks reached their lowest points following Powell's statement, with slight recovery near trading close. The Nasdaq declined over three per cent while closing. Meanwhile, Nvidia shares dropped approximately 7 per cent, having earlier fallen more than 10 per cent.The company revealed potential losses of $5.5 billion related to export licence restrictions for technology potentially utilisable in Chinese supercomputers.Jack Ablin of Cresset Capital noted that Powell's comments raised stagflation concerns and transformed a moderate decline into a substantial market drop.The dollar also weakened considerably against the euro following Powell's statements.

Bank of Canada keeps interest rates steady after seven continuous cuts,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/bank-of-canada-keeps-interest-rates-steady-after-seven-continuous-cuts/articleshow/120352047.cms,"The Bank of Canada paused its recent streak of interest rate cuts , holding the benchmark rate at 2.75% on Wednesday. The decision came after seven consecutive reductions since summer, aimed at lowering borrowing costs.However, rising global trade tensions have forced a more cautious approach.The central bank attributed the decision to “major shift in direction of US trade policy and the unpredictability of tariffs” explaining that these developments have “increased uncertainty, diminished prospects for economic growth, and raised inflation expectations.”The Canadian economy had started the year on a strong note, after ending the previous year with robust growth and inflation easing towards the bank’s 2 percent target. However, fresh waves of tariffs and erratic policy signals from US President Donald Trump have cast a shadow over the global economic outlook.While Canada was spared the most recent batch of tariffs announced on 2 April, it continues to face levies on steel, aluminium, some car models, and goods deemed non-compliant with the North American free trade pact. Trump has also threatened to expand the list to include lumber, semiconductors and pharmaceutical products.“A lot has happened since our March decision five weeks ago. But the future is no clearer,” said Bank of Canada governor Tiff Macklem. “We still do not know what tariffs will be imposed, whether they'll be reduced or escalated, or how long all of this will last.”He added that the central bank would wait for more clarity before considering its next move in June.Economists are split on what comes next. Avery Shenfeld of CIBC economics warned that if the Canadian economy shows signs of slowing in the coming months, the central bank will come under increasing pressure to cut rates again. Meanwhile, Royce Mendes of Desjardins struck a more hopeful tone, suggesting there is “some momentum behind the move towards better relations between the US and Canada.”Still, the Bank of Canada gave a dull outlook for the risks ahead, warning of a potential recession and surging prices, in case the trade war with the US continues. It also pointed to weakened financial markets, falling oil prices, and a stronger Canadian dollar driven by a broadly weaker US currency.The bank highlighted that consumer and business confidence dipped, dragging down spending, investment, and hiring. In the short term, it expects prices to rise due to supply disruptions and higher costs, but emphasised the need to stay the course.“Monetary policy cannot resolve trade uncertainty or offset the impacts of a trade war,” the bank said. “What it can and must do is maintain price stability for Canadians.”",The Bank of Canada held the benchmark rate at 2.75% on Wednesday.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021.

Space sector start-up Sisir Radar to develop SAR on L/P band SAR,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/space-sector-start-up-sisir-radar-to-develop-sar-on-l/p-band-sar/articleshow/104558111.cms,"CHENNAI: Space sector startup, Sisir Radar Private Ltd has hit success at the prestigious iDEX DefSpace Challenge with its projects for development of “L/P band Continuous Wave SAR (synthetic aperture radar) payload for LEO Small Satellites” and “Unfurlable, Electronically Steering Antenna for L/P band SAR payload” for Indian Air Force (IAF), said a top company official.The company is promoted by former Director at the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) Tapan Misra and the brains behind the Indian space agency’s RISAT series of SAR satellites as well as the Dual Frequency SAR on the Chandrayaan 2 orbiter that is currently circling the moon.""A grant of Rs 3 crore is also there for development of the products,"" Misra told IANS.Synthetic Aperture Radar or SAR is a special kind of imaging radar technology that can provide extremely accurate high resolution imagery of the terrain through clouds, smoke and dust even in pitch dark conditions. SAR imagery provides much higher resolution than other forms of remote sensing technology such as hyperspectral and multispectral. SAR is a critical technology for strategic reconnaissance and planning as well as for disaster management.According to Misra, winning the challenge in just over a year of floating the company is a major booster.He said L and P band SAR have an advantage over other frequencies (like X band) when it comes to penetration capabilities through rain, clouds, foliage and vegetation in a tropical country like India, and underground penetration capabilities in dry terrain.Continuing further, he said the L band SAR will provide 1 metre resolution, spotlight resolution in Stripmap mode. The current industry standard is 5-10 metre in L band. Misra said both the L and P band will operate simultaneously from a satellite borne SAR. Recently, Sisir Radar successfully developed and tested the world’s highest resolution L-Band SAR fitted on a drone. With 0.2 metre resolution, this is by far the highest L band SAR in the world, he said.","Space sector startup, Sisir Radar Private Ltd has hit success at the prestigious iDEX DefSpace Challenge.

Testify: Sam Bankman-Fried acknowledges 'mistakes' but testifies he did not defraud anyone,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/cryptocurrency/sam-bankman-fried-acknowledges-mistakes-but-testifies-he-did-not-defraud-anyone/articleshow/104761929.cms,"<p>Sam Bankman-Fried (File Photo- Reuters)<br></p>

NEW YORK: Sam Bankman-Fried , testifying in his own defense at his fraud trial on Friday, acknowledged that a ""lot of people got hurt"" when the FTX cryptocurrency exchange he founded collapsed, but said he did not defraud anyone or take customer funds.Shortly after taking the witness stand in Manhattan federal court, Bankman-Fried said he made ""a number of small mistakes and a number of larger mistakes"" while running the now-bankrupt exchange. The biggest mistake, he said, was not implementing a dedicated risk management team.""We thought that we might be able to build the best product on the market,"" Bankman-Fried said. ""It turned out basically the opposite of that. A lot of people got hurt - customers, employees - and the company ended up in bankruptcy.""Prosecutors accuse Bankman-Fried of using FTX customer funds to prop up his crypto-focused hedge fund, Alameda Research, make speculative venture investments and donate more than $100 million to US political campaigns. He also faces charges of scheming to cheat Alameda's lenders and FTX investors.He has pleaded not guiltyBankman-Fried's trial, which began on October 3, is drawing to a close nearly a year after FTX collapsed amid a wave of customer withdrawals. The company declared bankruptcy in November 2022 and Bankman-Fried was indicted the following month.His testimony marked the first time the dozen jurors and five alternates have heard directly from the 31-year-old former billionaire after 12 trial days.Bankman-Fried, who was jailed in August after US District Judge Lewis Kaplan found he likely tampered with witnesses, wore a suit and spoke with two water bottles placed in front of him on the witness stand. The former mogul once known for wearing shorts and T-shirts and sporting an unkempt mop of curly locks cut his hair before his trial began.Responding to questions posed by his defense lawyer Mark Cohen, Bankman-Fried spoke in calm, measured tones during the first portion of his testimony as he recounted founding Alameda in 2017, shortly after graduating from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, despite knowing little about crypto.But Bankman-Fried - who had studied physics and worked as a quantitative trader at Jane Street - said he saw opportunities for ""arbitrage"" in the market for digital assets. He said Alameda's first office was in a small Airbnb in Berkeley, California, before he later moved the firm to Hong Kong.""We wanted to be under the radar at that point in time,"" he said on the stand, adding he named the hedge fund after the California county where it was founded in part so competitors would not discover what they were doing.Jurors have heard from three of his closest confidantes at FTX and Alameda, all of whom have pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors. They testified earlier this month that they committed financial crimes at Bankman-Fried's behest.For criminal defendants, taking the stand is a risky proposition because it opens them up to potentially probing cross-examination by prosecutors.But given Bankman-Fried's penchant for risk, legal experts say he likely viewed taking the stand as his best shot to counter the allegations made by members of his inner circle, which were backed up by spreadsheets the three said demonstrated how customer funds were stolen and text messages in which they discussed FTX's shortfall of funds with Bankman-Fried.","Sam Bankman-Fried says he made ""a number of small mistakes and a number of larger mistakes"" while running the now-bankrupt exchange.

"Crypto isn’t dead, it’s evolving rapidly to create a new world",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/cryptocurrency/crypto-isnt-dead-its-evolving-rapidly-to-create-a-new-world/articleshow/101324954.cms,"Regulatory landscape



There are few technologies as confusing to most people as crypto and blockchain. The tech and regulations underpinning it are evolving so rapidly, it is difficult for even technologists to often make sense of it.Crypto assets and crypto currencies are based on blockchain tech, which is a form of distributed ledger technology that stores data on thousands of data servers around the world, as opposed to today where data is stored only in one place or clustered in a few locations. This data is open, meaning it can be viewed and verified by anyone taking part in that particular system. What this means practically is that an individual can transfer crypto assets without the help of intermediaries, say, banks or government agencies, thereby ensuring privacy, speed and lower costs.The first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin , was created with anonymity in mind, it was a way for people to conduct financial transactions away from the prying eyes of governments. While it went on to become a speculative asset, today, crypto, and the underlying blockchain technology, has a far more ambitious goal – the transformation of the internet.CoinDCX CTO Vivek Gupta says this technology can help usher in Web 3. 0 – a decentralised form of the internet where users can actually monetise their time spent online. “Whatever Web3 use case you may be driving, the value that comes from it must be distributed, and you cannot distribute that without crypto. For something as simple as depositing money in a pool and getting a receipt token, that receipt token is a crypto. That’s the proof that I have deposited the money. Without crypto there is no Web3 use case,” he says.Decentralised finance (DeFi) is a huge part of what makes blockchain tech so disruptive. Imagine being able to lend your money to strangers on the internet and get paid an interest. Or imagine spending time on socialmedia platforms or playing video games and getting paid for your time spent by someone who needs data about you. Web3 makes this possible because the data isn’t controlled by any one company or country.Decentralised apps (dApps) are another Web3 feature. Unlike traditional apps hosted on centralised servers, dApps operate on a peer-to-peer network and utilisethe consensus mechanism and transparency features of blockchain technology.“I see a big disruption coming, especially in the DeFi tokenisation space and the whole content creator economy,” says Ravi Chamria, co-founder & CEO of Zeeve, a blockchain automation platform.Ashish Singhal, co-founder & CEO of CoinSwitch, says the tech can revolutionise how we conduct business, store data, and even vote, since the tech allows people to verify data of any kind efficiently.Governments are worried about what crypto could mean for monetary policy, for their ability to regulate people’s lives. But disruption hardly ever requires consensus. If a new technology proves to be better than an old one, people will drift towards it.Central banks have recognised the importance of the technology and some are creating Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) that are based on blockchain technology. “There’s a lot of activity happening in the regulated DeFi space. Looking at the future, we think guardrails are probably a good thing to have around these sorts of technologies,” says Andrew Vranjes, VP of sales at Blockdaemon, a blockchain infrastructure platform.Cryptocurrencies too are rapidly changing. Where before the value of cryptocurrencies were based on what people were willing to pay for them, today there are crypto assets that are backed by real world assets like equity and real estate. Silvina Moschini’s Unicoin is one of them. “It is an assets backed, audited, SEC-compliant cryptocurrency,” she says.","Crypto assets and crypto currencies are based on blockchain tech, which is a form of distributed ledger technology that stores data on thousands of data servers around the world.

"US tightens crackdown on crypto with lawsuits against Coinbase, Binance",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/cryptocurrency/bitcoin/us-tightens-crackdown-on-crypto-with-lawsuits-against-coinbase-binance/articleshow/100810119.cms,"BROKER, EXCHANGE CRACKDOWN



NEW YORK: The top U.S. securities regulator sued cryptocurrency platform Coinbase on Tuesday, the second lawsuit in two days against a major crypto exchange, in a dramatic escalation of a crackdown on the industry and one that could dramatically transform a market that has largely operated outside regulation.The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Monday took aim at Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange. The SEC accuses Binance and its CEO Changpeng Zhao of operating a ""web of deception"".If successful, the lawsuits could transform the crypto market by successfully asserting the SEC's jurisdiction over the industry which for years has argued that tokens do not constitute securities and should not be regulated by the SEC.""The two cases are different, but overlap and point in the same direction: the SEC's increasingly aggressive campaign to bring cryptocurrencies under the jurisdiction of the federal securities laws,"" said Kevin O'Brien, a partner at Ford O'Brien Landy and a former federal prosecutor, adding, however, that the SEC has not previously taken on such major crypto players.""If the SEC prevails in either case, the cryptocurrency industry will be transformed.""In its complaint filed in Manhattan federal court, the SEC said Coinbase has since at least 2019 made billions of dollars by operating as a middleman on crypto transactions, while evading disclosure requirements meant to protect investors.The SEC said Coinbase traded at least 13 crypto assets that are securities that should have been registered, including tokens such as Solana, Cardano and Polygon.Coinbase suffered about $1.28 billion of net customer outflows following the lawsuit, according to initial estimates from data firm Nansen. Shares of Coinbase's parent Coinbase Global Inc closed down $7.10, or 12.1%, at $51.61 after earlier falling as much as 20.9%. They are up 46% this year.Paul Grewal, Coinbase's general counsel, in a statement said the company will continue operating as usual and has ""demonstrated commitment to compliance.""Oanda senior market analyst Ed Moya said the SEC ""looks like it's playing Whac-A-Mole with crypto exchanges,"" and because most exchanges offer a range of tokens that operate on blockchain protocols targeted by regulators, ""it seems like this is just the beginning.""Leading cryptocurrency bitcoin has been a paradoxical beneficiary of the crackdown.After an initial plunge to a nearly three-month low of $25,350 following the Binance suit, bitcoin rebounded by more than $2,000, exceeding the previous day's high. It was trading just below $27,000 at 0410 GMT.""The SEC is making life nearly impossible for several altcoins and that is actually driving some crypto traders back into bitcoin,"" explained Oanda's Moya.Securities, as opposed to other assets such as commodities, are strictly regulated and require detailed disclosures to inform investors of potential risks. The Securities Act of 1933 outlined a definition of the term ""security,"" yet many experts rely on two U.S. Supreme Court cases to determine if an investment product constitutes a security.SEC Chair Gary Gensler has long said tokens constitute securities and has steadily asserted its authority over the crypto market, focusing initially on the sale of tokens and interest-bearing crypto products. More recently, it has taken aim at unregistered crypto broker dealer, exchange trading and clearing activity.While a few crypto companies are licensed as alternative system trading systems, a type of trading platform used by brokers to trade listed securities, no crypto platform operates as a full-blown stock exchange. The SEC also this year sued Beaxy Digital and Bittrex Global for failing to register as an exchange, clearing house and broker.""The whole business model is built on a noncompliance with the U.S. securities laws and we're asking them to come into compliance,"" Gensler told CNBC.Crypto companies refute that tokens meet the definition of a security, say the SEC's rules are ambiguous, and that the SEC is overstepping its authority in trying to regulate them. Still, many companies have boosted compliance, shelved products and expanded outside the country in response to the crackdown.Kristin Smith, CEO of the Blockchain Association trade group, rejected Gensler's efforts to oversee the industry.""We're confident the courts will prove Chair Gensler wrong in due time,"" she said.Founded in 2012, Coinbase recently served more than 108 million customers and ended March with $130 billion of customer crypto assets and funds on its balance sheet. Transactions generated 75% of its $3.15 billion of net revenue last year.Tuesday's SEC lawsuit seeks civil fines, the recouping of ill-gotten gains and injunctive relief.On Monday, the SEC accused Binance of inflating trading volumes, diverting customer funds, improperly commingling assets, failing to restrict U.S. customers from its platform, and misleading customers about its controls.Binance pledged to vigorously defend itself against the lawsuit, which it said reflected the SEC's ""misguided and conscious refusal"" to provide clarity to the crypto industry.Customers pulled around $790 million from Binance and its U.S. affiliate following the lawsuit, Nansen said.On Tuesday, the SEC filed a motion to freeze assets belonging to Binance.US, Binance's U.S. affiliate. The holding company of Binance is based in the Cayman Islands.""It's important to note that recent regulatory actions are aimed at ensuring that companies operating in the cryptocurrency industry are complying with securities laws and protecting investors - this will always be their goal,"" said Joshua Chu, group chief risk officer at blockchain technology firms XBE, Coinllectibles and Marvion.""These events will ultimately lead to a more stable and trustworthy industry, which could help to attract more institutional investors and mainstream adoption.""","The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Monday took aim at Binance.

Cryptoverse: Bitcoin miners escape the bear trap,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/cryptocurrency/bitcoin/cryptoverse-bitcoin-miners-escape-the-bear-trap/articleshow/99577419.cms,"OUT OF THE WOODS?



Beleaguered bitcoin miners are finally feeling the spring sunshine after a cold, hard crypto winter .The power-hungry companies that pump new bitcoin into circulation have been thrown a lifeline by the cryptocurrency's rally to above $30,000 this year, which has conspired with falling electricity prices to boost their profitability.The 30-day average of mining revenues has risen to $27.34 million a day, the highest level since last June, according to data from Blockchain.com.That's a relief for miners that struggled to service large debt burdens as revenues languished between $15 million and $21 million for most of the second half of 2022. They're still some way off a peak of $61.2 million hit in November 2021, though.""Many public miners were on the brink of bankruptcy at the end of last year. At the current bitcoin price, these companies' cash flows have substantially improved and most of them should have no problem paying their obligations,"" said Jaran Mellerud , analyst at bitcoin mining services company Luxor.Miners' debt-to-equity ratios now look much healthier, said Mellerud, adding that many companies had restructured and paid down debt over the past few months.Marathon Digital Holdings' debt-to-equity ratio has dropped to 0.5 from 2 since the start of this year, for example, while Greenidge Generation Holdings' has dropped to 5.8 from 11.7, according to data from Luxor.The spring thaw has seen investors flock back to publicly traded crypto mining companies; Among the biggest players, Marathon and Riot Platforms have seen their share price more than triple this year, while the Valkyrie Bitcoin Miners ETF is up 162% and Greenidge has gained 137%. But they've all still lost money since early 2022.Bitcoin mining is the process by which a network of computers validates a block of transactions on the blockchain. Miners are rewarded with bitcoin for completing a block, competing against other miners by solving intricate maths puzzles with energy-intensive computing systems, meaning electricity comprises a significant chunk of their operating costs.Declines in power prices, particularly in the U.S., have eased pressure on company margins, according to analysts at BTIG, who said the electricity cost for producing one bitcoin has fallen about 40% from the end of last year.That means that despite both the computing power available on the network and mining difficulty rising steadily to new all time highs - meaning it should take more power to mine one block - the 30-day average cost-per-transaction for miners has fallen to its lowest level since September, Blockchain.com data showed.Miners can't get too cozy though, given their fortunes are tied to bitcoin's capricious price trajectory.""If we see bitcoin top out and consolidate, the run-up in miners may do the same, we expect to see more volatility as we head into summer,"" said Kevin Kelly , head of research at Delphi Digital, although he sees a favorable environment for crypto persisting through 2023, compared with last year.Despite improvements in their balance sheets, many miners still have plenty of debt to pay down and are still struggling, said Luxor's Mellerud.""The bitcoin price increase has bought these companies time, but it would be detrimental for these companies if it were to fall back down to $20,000,"" he said.Most companies are focusing on debt reduction rather than spending on new equipment, BTIG said, even as the estimated cost of new mining rigs has dropped around 69% since the end of 2021.There are some exceptions however, with CleanSpark taking advantage of falling prices to purchase of 45,000 new mining rigs, which would nearly double its computing power.A rapid rise in power prices or a fast fall in bitcoin could usher in a new cold spell. For now though, the sun is shining.""I don't think we're completely out of the woods, but I think the worst is behind us,"" said Marcus Sotiriou , analyst at digital asset broker GlobalBlock.","The 30-day average of mining revenues has risen to $27.34 million a day, the highest level since last June. That's a relief for miners that struggled to service large debt burdens as revenues languished between $15 million and $21 million for most of 2022.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-99577406,imgsize-78328,width-400,resizemode-4/99577406.jpg"

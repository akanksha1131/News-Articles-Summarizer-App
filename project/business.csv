What FM Nirmala Sitharaman said on Income Tax Slabs

“Democracy, Demography and Demand are the key support pillars in our journey towards Viksit Bharat. The middle class provides strength for India’s growth. This Government under the leadership of Prime Minister Modi has always believed in the admirable energy and ability of the middle class in nation building,” Sitharaman said.

There will be no income tax payable upto income of Rs 12 lakh (i.e. average income of Rs 1 lakh per month other than special rate income such as capital gains) under the new regime. This limit will be Rs 12.75 lakh for salaried tax payers, due to standard deduction of Rs 75,000.

Income Tax Slabs FY 2025-26 New versus Old Income Tax Regime: Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has given the middle class, common man and salaried taxpayers a big income tax relief bonanza in the Union Budget 2025. With no income tax burden for income levels up to Rs 12.75 lakh, a big section of the middle class has found reason to cheer.All the changes in the income tax slabs and income tax rates for financial year 2025-26 have been brought in the new income tax regime. Hence, the most important question that is there in the minds of salaried income taxpayers is - after Budget 2025 which income tax regime is better for me? Is it time to switch to the new income tax regime or does the old income tax regime with higher tax exemptions and deductions still make sense? TOI answers this important question for you:According to EY, the simple thumb rule that every salaried taxpayer needs to follow is: calculate the total exemptions and deductions that you want to claim in a year under the old income tax regime.Also Read | Union Budget: No income tax up to Rs 12 lakh - a simple guide to what it actually means for taxpayers If the gross income is more than Rs 24.75 lakh, then a salaried individual is better off taking the new income regime only if the deductions and exemptions (Deductions and exemptions which are not allowed under the new tax regime) are less than Rs 8 lakh (excluding standard deduction).It is important to note that this threshold or break-even level of Rs 8 lakh is specific to the 30% tax bracket, that is for income above Rs 24 lakh or Rs 24.75 lakh (including standard deduction). This break-even level will vary for income levels below Rs 24 lakh, as is evident from the table below where specific examples have been given for gross salary levels of Rs 14 lakh, Rs 18 lakh and Rs 22 lakh.Also Check | Income Tax Slabs 2025-26 Budget 2025 Live Updates “The finance minister has proposed reforms to personal taxes with special focus on middle-class tax payers. While there are limited exemptions available under the new tax regime, taxpayers with a gross income exceeding Rs 24.75 lakhs will find the new tax regime beneficial if their total deductions and exemptions, such as those under Section 80C for specified savings, Section 80D for medical insurance, interest on education loan, donations, HRA exemption, and home loan interest under Section 24, which are not available in the new regime, are less than Rs 8,00,000,” explains Surabhi Marwah, Tax Partner at EY India.“Therefore, when choosing between the old and new tax regimes, it is crucial for taxpayers to carefully compare their deductions and exemptions eligible under the old tax regime with the potential tax savings offered by the lower rates being proposed in the new tax regime,” she says.","New Vs Old Income Tax Regime: Which one should salaried taxpayers opt for post Budget 2025?

Is it better to stay on rent or get your own place? It’s complicated, to borrow a phrase from romantic conundrums. So, should one spend a big sum on a house property – especially with the help of a home loan – given that prices are higher and the capital appreciation in many towns is not as significant as it once was? Isn’t living on rent, perhaps closer to the office, easier? On the other hand, an investment in a house property is a secured and tangible investment. Plus, a house is not just four walls; there is a lot of emotion attached to it. Let’s look at it from the tax perspective…One of the biggest advantages of renting a house from a tax perspective is the exemption for house rent allowance (HRA), a tax-efficient salary component. If HRA is not a part of your salary package — for example if you are self-employed or a consultant— you can avail deduction of up to 5,000 a month from gross taxableincome, under the old tax regime. The HRA exemption is not available to taxpayers who opt for the new tax regime. The exemption is on the lowest of the following:● Rent paid less 10% of salary (basic salary and dearness allowance)● 50% of salary if the house is in Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata or Chennai, or 40% of salary in other cities● Actual HRA received● Rent may be lower than a home loan EMI● More choice of location and type● Easy to relocate to another area of city● Tax benefits are available (under old tax regime)● Rent, however high, does not go towards creating an asset● Rents usually increase every year, leading to higher cash outflow● No or limited scope of making structural changes● One may have to vacate on short noticeTax benefits are only available under the old tax regime. If you take a home loan to buy a house property, the EMI is typically made up of two parts: one part goes towards the principal (the amount you took as loan) and the other towards the interest (the cost of servicing the loan).Deduction is available under the overall 1.5 lakh limit under Section 80C under the old tax regime. Principal repayment, stamp duty, registration fee and other expenses related to transfer of the house property qualify for the deduction, under this limit.Three situations apply: the house is self-occupied, vacant or rented out. For a self-occupied house property, there is deduction available on the interest paid on home loan up to 2 lakh per annum under the old tax regime. This can be set off against any other income. The same rules apply even if the house is vacant. If you have rented out the house, you can claim deduction for not only the interest paid on the home loan, but also municipal taxes paid and a standard deduction of 30% of the rental income.If your house is a self-occupied property bought using a home loan, it means you do not earn any rental income from it. Therefore, interest paid on the home loan will result in a loss. Total loss up to 2 lakh from house property (either self-occupied or letout) can be adjusted in a financial year against any other head of income (such as salary or income from other sources). Loss exceeding 2 lakh can be carried forward for eight subsequent assessment years but can be setoff only against ‘Income from house property’.The concept of notional rent applies when an individual owns three houses or more. In such cases, two house properties are considered self-occupied (without any conditions as per the 2025 Budget proposals) and the remaining are treated as ‘deemed let-out’, thus attracting notional rent. This is based on the expected market rent and becomes a taxable income.● A house is an asset and EMIs go towards creating this asset● Substantial tax benefits on home loans● Heavy upfront costs such as down payment and registration, followed by property taxes and repairs● House properties are illiquid as they cannot be sold quickly● Property prices see fluctuations and may not fetch expected returns● EMIs have to be paid regularly, mostly irrespective of situations like loss of income","One of the biggest advantages of renting a house from a tax perspective is the exemption for house rent allowance (HRA), a tax-efficient salary component. If HRA is not a part of your salary package, you can avail deduction of up to 5,000 a month from gross taxableincome.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117857373,imgsize-147566,width-400,resizemode-4/117857373.jpg"

NEW DELHI: After giving major tax relief to middle class salaried individuals in Union Budget 2025 , finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said the significant tax relief provided by the Modi government has put more more money in people's hands compared to the tax structure in 2014 under the previous Congress-led government. The reforms, aimed at putting more money back into taxpayers' hands, have resulted in substantial savings across different income brackets, Sitharaman said.""If you compare what we have done today with what was done in 2014 under the Congress government, the change in rates has also benefited people earning Rs 24 lakh.

Later, it was raised to Rs 7 lakh and now it being raised to Rs 12 lakh. The government feels that on the average Rs 1 lakh per month (income), you need not pay tax.""Speaking on the changes, officials emphasised that middle-class and higher-income earners alike are benefitting from the lower tax rates and increased rebates. The government provided a comparative breakdown:The government stressed that the benefits extend beyond just those earning up to Rs 12 lakh, where tax rebates have been introduced.Even those earning Rs 24 lakh per year will see a reduction in their tax liability, ensuring a more progressive and taxpayer-friendly system.Additionally, the Finance Ministry provided a comparison with the prevailing 2024 tax rates and the newly proposed structure:Finance Secretary emphasised that these tax cuts represent a ""substantial amount being put back into the hands of people who deserve it."" He also noted that not only have rebates been introduced, but the overall tax rates have been lowered, benefiting a broader segment of taxpayers.With these changes, the government has reinforced its commitment to reducing the tax burden, boosting disposable income, and supporting economic growth, ensuring that taxpayers retain a greater share of their earnings.","Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said the significant tax relief provided by the Modi government has put more more money in people's hands.

How will a person who has an income Rs 12 lakh benefit from new rates?

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced sweeping changes in the new income tax regime, announcing revamped income tax slabs and income tax rates for the salaried taxpayers, individual taxpayers, common man and middle class. The biggest announcement was that people earning up to Rs 12 lakh income will not have to pay income tax!The three pillars - Democracy, Demography and Demand - form the foundation for our progression towards Viksit Bharat. India's middle class serves as a crucial driving force for economic advancement. The current administration, led by Prime Minister Modi, recognises the middle class's vital contribution and capabilities in building the nation, FM Nirmala Sitharaman said. With effect from assessment year 2026-27, it is proposed that the following rates provided under the proposed clause (iii) of sub-section (1A) of section 115BAC of the Act shall be the rates applicable for determining the income-tax payable in respect of the total income of a person, being an individual or Hindu undivided family or association of persons [other than a co-operative society], or body of individuals, whether incorporated or not, or an artificial juridical person referred to in subclause (vii) of clause (31) of section 2:—Acknowledging the role of middle class, FM Sitharaman said that they have consistently reduced middle class income taxation burden. Since 2014, the 'Nil tax' threshold has seen progressive increases: initially to Rs 2.5 lakh, then to Rs 5 lakh in 2019, and subsequently to Rs 7 lakh in 2023, demonstrating the government's confidence in middle-class taxpayers.A significant announcement introduces tax exemption for incomes up to Rs 12 lakh under the new regime (excluding special rate income like capital gains). For salaried individuals, this threshold extends to Rs 12.75 lakh, factoring in the standard deduction of Rs 75,000.The comprehensive revision of tax slabs and rates aims to benefit all taxpayers, particularly enabling the middle class to retain more disposable income, which should enhance household spending, savings and investment potential.The income tax slabs for FY 2025-26 under the old income tax regime continue to be the same:For regular income up to Rs 12 lakh (excluding special rate income such as capital gains), taxpayers receive a tax rebate alongside benefits from reduced slab rates, effectively eliminating their tax liability.The impact of these modifications can be quantified through specific examples:- At Rs 12 lakh income level: Rs 80,000 tax benefit (complete tax exemption)- At Rs 18 lakh income level: Rs 70,000 tax reduction (30% of previous tax liability)- At Rs 25 lakh income level: Rs 1,10,000 tax saving (25% of previous tax liability)The new income tax slabs have been announced by FM Nirmala Sitharaman. These tax slabs and rates are applicable for the new income tax regime. In this article, a detailed table shows the latest income tax slabs for FY 2025-26.In order to calculate income tax under the new tax regime, an individual needs to first determine their gross income by adding earnings from all sources, such as salary, property, and other sources etc. Next, they should apply the rates available under new tax regime to their income. After calculating the tax for each income slab, sum these amounts to find the total tax. Then, add the Health and Education Cess (4%) and surcharge (if applicable) to determine the final tax liability.Unlike the old regime, the new tax regime does not allow most deductions, such as those under Section 80C or for HRA, but some exemptions remain, such as the employer’s contribution to NPS.From assessment year 2026-27 onwards, for an assessee, being an individual resident in India whose income is chargeable to tax under the sub-section (1A) of section 115BAC, it is proposed to,–(i) enhance the limit of total income for rebate in clause (a) and (b) of first proviso under section 87A, on which the income-tax is payable as per the rates of income-tax under sub-section (1A) of section 115BAC, from Rs. 7,00,000/- to Rs. 12,00,000/- and the limit of rebate in clause (a) of first proviso to section 87A from Rs. 25,000/- to Rs. 60,000/-.(ii) rationalise the first proviso to section 87A by inserting a new proviso so as to provide that the deduction under the first proviso, shall not exceed the amount ofincome-tax payable as per the rates provided in sub-section (1A) of section 115BAC.In the proposed new tax regime, the maximum total income for which tax liability for individual taxpayers is NIL is Rs. 12 lakhs.The benefit of such Nil tax liability mentioned above is available only in the new tax regime. This New tax regime is the default regime. To avail the benefit of rebate allowable under proposed provisions of new tax regime, only return is to be filed otherwise no other step is required to be taken.Any individual earlier was required to pay a tax of Rs 80,000 (in the new regime) for an income of Rs 12 lakh. Now he will be required to pay nil tax on such income.","Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced sweeping changes in the new income tax regime.

TDS threshold for fixed deposits interest income earned by senior citizens will go up from Rs 50,000 to Rs 1 lakh from FY26 and the Budget has also proposed an increase in tax deduction at source (TDS) threshold on interest earned from fixed deposits for non-senior citizens from Rs 40,000 to Rs 50,000 per financial year.""Additional deposits will increase the banking systems' liquidity, reducing dependency on high cost borrowing,"" said Nagaraju in his presentation.He also said the finance ministry will send a draft bill, which would seek to raise the FDI limit in the insurance sector to 100% from the current 74% for Cabinet approval.""The finance minister has already given her approval and announced it in the Budget.

Wall Street to Dalal Street: Investors on edge,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/wall-street-to-dalal-street-investors-on-edge/articleshow/117896035.cms,"A global tariff war that was started by the US on Saturday night, is spreading panic among markets around the world on Monday with several of the leading indices deep in the red. The Indian market, however, on Monday held on to its ground despite continuous selling by foreign funds. On Monday, among the major Asian indices, the Nikkei in Japan closed 2.6% lower while Hang Seng and Shanghai both closed flat. On Dalal Street , the sensex closed 319 points or 0.4% lower at 77,187 points.In Europe, in mid-session, Dax in Germany was down 1.3% while FTSE in the UK was down 1.1%. Across the Atlantic, the Dow Jones was down 0.3% lower after falling over 1.4% in early trades. After a sharply lower open, as US President Donald Trump indicated that US and Mexico were negotiating about tariffs, the markets recovered from their early lows.According to Vinod Nair of Geojit Financial Services, the global market got unsettled amid the onset of the 'trade war', as tariff conflicts between the US and other nations are unlikely to yield any economic benefits. ""Instead, it may cause challenges to the global economy, heightening global financial risks. International trade, which had flourished under the framework of globalisation, now faces threats from the new protectionist policies. Front and contour tariffs are expected to make the world less efficient and elevate global inflation & interest rates.""","The Indian market, however, on Monday held on to its ground despite continuous selling by foreign funds.

BofA Securities has maintained its ‘buy’ recommendation on Reliance Industries with a target price of Rs 1,550 (+24%). Analysts feel that the launch of Chinese fast fashion major Shein through RIL’s platform is directionally positive for the company.

They see minimum inventory risks from Reliance Retail’s perspective.Motilal Oswal Financial Services has a ‘neutral’ stance on IRB Infrastructure with a target price of Rs 63 (+19%).

It closed at 87.19, down 58 paise from its previous close, marking its largest single-day drop in two weeks.Rupee might have weakened further had RBI not intervened through public sector banks. Some dealers speculate RBI is letting the rupee adjust in line with other Asian currencies. Along with Asian currencies, the Mexican peso dropped more than 2%, hitting a nearly three-year low.Sensex dropped by 319.2 points (0.41%) to 77,186.7, and the Nifty index fell by 121.1 points (0.52%) to 23,361.

There's also a chance that negotiations could lead to lower tariffs. As new information emerges, the dollar may oscillate, possibly reaching 114 before pulling back. However, if investors realise these tariffs could hurt both other countries and the US economy, the dollar could weaken,"" said Ashhish Vaidya, head of treasury at DBS Bank.""The question is how much lower the rupee can go. It depends largely on what RBI will do. There is already panic, with importers rushing to book dollars, thus increasing demand. Will RBI sell dollars now, or let the market decide?"" said Madan Sabnavis, chief economist at Bank of Baroda. Sabnavis noted that managing rupee movements with liquidity is tricky, as selling dollars would drain liquidity. ""All eyes are on RBI now for monetary action,"" he added.Meanwhile, the Canadian dollar dropped to its lowest level since 2003, and the euro neared parity with the dollar. Trump also hinted at tariffs on European goods, leading to a global stock market downturn.

Customs authorities say that the unit of the German manufacturer in India, Škoda Auto Volkswagen India, was trying to skirt higher duties by classifying imports of Audi, Skoda and Volkswagen cars as ""individual parts"".According to authorities, imports of various unassembled parts of cars should have been declared as ""completely knocked down"" (CKD) units, which would attract duties of 30-35%.

Gold loan fastest growing segment,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gold-loan-fastest-growing-segment/articleshow/117897102.cms,"MUMBAI: Gold loans surged by 71% year-on-year in Dec-end, emerging as the fastest-growing segment within personal loans . Individual borrowings against FDs and shares saw a year-on-year increase of 19% and 22%, in Dec 2024.According to data on sectoral deployment of bank credit released by RBI, gold loan portfolio of banks rose to Rs 1.7 lakh crore as on Dec 27, 2024. This reflects a 71% increase from the previous year and a 68.3% rise in the current financial year.Analysts attribute the growth in this segment to three main factors. First, a shift from non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) to banks, driven by regulatory changes, has enabled banks to capture 82% of the market share, compared to 18% held by NBFCs as of Oct. Second, rising gold prices have allowed borrowers to unlock more value from their gold, securing larger loans. Third, financial distress among households has led many to opt for secured loans against gold, as personal loans remain sluggish.In the broader personal loan segment, credit card outstandings grew by 15.6% to Rs 2.9 lakh crore. Home loans remained the largest segment in bank credit with an outstanding of Rs 29.3 lakh crore, though growth slowed to 11.1% year-on-year. Consumer durables are the only segment which showed a negative growth, albeit a modest 1.1%.RBI data showed that non-food credit, which stood at Rs 172.5 lakh crore as of Dec 2024, saw an 11.1% overall increase. The agriculture sector contributed 12.5% to this growth, with an addition of Rs 1.67 lakh crore. The personal loan segment grew marginally slower at 12%, but it made the highest contribution to credit growth due to its larger size - Rs 58 lakh crore - resulting in an addition of Rs 4.6 lakh crore over the past 12 months. Credit growth in the industrial sector, which stood at Rs 38.5 lakh crore, remained sluggish at 7.2%.

Asian stocks took a hit overnight, with Japan’s Nikkei tumbling 2.8 per cent and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng down 1 per cent.However, mainland Chinese markets remain closed until Wednesday due to the Lunar New Year holiday.European markets are bracing for further declines as investors assess the risk of a global trade war .

During early trade in Asia, Bitcoin fell to $94,476.18, briefly hitting a three-week low of $91,441.89.Ether saw an even steeper drop of 24 per cent, hitting its lowest level since September, to $2,494.33.The downturn extended into Sunday, with bitcoin slipping 7 per cent to $93,768.66, according to Coin Metrics. The CoinDesk 20 index, which tracks the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market capitalisation, dropped 19 per cent.The selloff follows US President Donald Trump’s announcements of a a 25 per cent levy on imports from Canada and Mexico and a 10 per cent tariff on Chinese goods, set to take effect on Tuesday. Given that the US conducts around $1.6 trillion in annual trade with these three nations, the move has heightened fears of an economic slowdown.In retaliation to the levies, Canada and Mexico vowed to impose countermeasures, while China signalled plans to challenge the tariffs at the World Trade Organisation.""Crypto is really the only way to express risk over the weekend, and on news like this, crypto resorts to a risk proxy,"" Chris Weston, head of research at Pepperstone, told CNBC.

Much of this rally was driven by expectations that his administration would introduce crypto-friendly policies, with Trump himself vowing to make the US the ""crypto capital of the planet.""However, despite early optimism, some investors have grown impatient over the lack of concrete regulatory reforms. Last month, Trump ordered the formation of a cryptocurrency working group to explore potential regulations and even consider a national crypto reserve, but rigid policy changes remain absent.Jeff Park, head of alpha strategies at Bitwise Asset Management, believes the ongoing tariff war could ultimately benefit bitcoin in the long run. ""“A sustained tariff war will be amazing for bitcoin in the long run due to an eventual weakening of the dollar and US rates."" he told ET.Analysts are keeping a close eye on the $90,000 support level for bitcoin, warning that a drop below this threshold could trigger a slide towards $80,000.

Further lookout for trade war

US President Donald Trump’s latest trade war proved to be a major blow for Canada, Mexico and China, pushing their currencies to multi-year lows.The greenback recorded a major gain while weighing down Euro to a two year low and injuring the conventional safe haven Swiss frank to its lowest since May.However, two biggest trading partners for the States’ Canada and Mexico, wasted no time in vowing retaliation measures. China also condemned the move, claiming it would challenge the tariffs at the World Trade Organization, news agency Reuters reported.Last month after assuming office, Trump had threatened to hit Canada and Mexico with a 25 per cent tariff and while China stood at a levy of 10 per cent, alleging to combat issues like illegal immigration and drug trade.The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against six major currencies, gained 0.11 per cent to 109.65 after hitting a three-week high previously in the session.The tariff news also shifted expectations for Federal Reserve policy . Traders scaled back bets on interest rate cuts, pricing in just 41 basis points of easing this year—down from 47 basis points previously.The US dollar climbed 0.7 per cent to 7.2552 yuan in offshore trading, after briefly hitting a record 7.3765 yuan. With Chinese markets closed for Lunar New Year, traders expect further volatility when trading resumes on Wednesday.It jumped 2.7 per cent to 21.40 Mexican pesos, the highest since March 2022.The Canadian dollar weakened 1.4 per cent to C$1.4755 per US dollar, a level last seen in 2003.It plunged 2.3 per cent to $1.0125, a low last recorded in November 2022, before a minor reverse back to $1.0257.It fell 0.74 per cent reaching $1.2304.Though global markets were tumbling down, the Japanese yen held firm at 155.50 per dollar.US economic data released on Friday showed the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, closely observed by the Federal Reserve—rose 0.3 per cent in the past month, the largest increase since April 2024. This suggests the Fed may be in no rush to resume cutting interest rates.Meanwhile, cryptocurrencies took a hit. Bitcoin slid 4.4 per cent to $97,622, falling back below $100,000 for the first time in nearly three weeks. Ether tumbled 15 per cent to $2,812.8, its lowest level since early November.Donald Trump is expected to discuss the tariffs with Canada and Mexico, arguing that Americans may feel economic ""pain"" from the 25 percent duties but that it will be ""worth the price.""He informed news agency AFP of ""speaking with Prime Minister (Justin) Trudeau tomorrow morning, and I'm also speaking with Mexico tomorrow morning.""""I don't expect anything very dramatic,"" he added.China, Mexico and Canada are the top three US trade partners and all have vowed to retaliate when the tariffs take effect Tuesday.","US President Donald Trump’s latest trade war proved to be a major blow for Canada, Mexico and China, pushing their currencies to multi-year lows.

NEW DELHI: Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Sunday announced that Canada would impose 25% tariffs on $106 billion worth US imports in a retaliatory move against Donald Trump. This came moments after the latter signed the executive order imposing steep tariffs on imports from Mexico, Canada, and China, escalating tensions in an emerging trade war.""Canada will be responding to the US trade action with 25% tariffs against Can$155 billion ($106 billion) worth of American goods,"" he saidHe urged the Canadians to prevent vacationing in US to fight back over the tariff imposition.Further, Trudeau announced that retaliatory duties on $30 billion worth of US alcohol and fruit will take effect Tuesday, coinciding with the implementation of US tariffs. He began his address with a direct message to American consumers.“It will have real consequences for you, the American people,” he said.“The actions taken today by the White House split us apart instead of bringing us together,” Trudeau said, warning that it could bring about “dark times"" for many.Trump declared an economic emergency to impose tariffs of 10% on all imports from China and 25% on goods from Mexico and Canada. However, energy imports from Canada—including oil, natural gas, and electricity—would be subject to a reduced 10% tariff.""Today, I have implemented a 25% Tariff on Imports from Mexico and Canada (10% on Canadian Energy), and a 10% additional Tariff on China.

Inflation pressures persist



Donald Trump inherits a healthy economy



Global comparison



The US economy wrapped up 2024 on a solid note, with consumer spending and government support playing key roles in driving growth, according to new data from the Commerce Department.Despite some challenges, the economy grew by 2.3% in the fourth quarter, slightly below the 2.4% that economists had expected. For the full year, GDP grew by 2.8%, a strong performance, although slightly down from the 2.9% growth in 2023.Consumer spending rose by 4.2% in the final quarter of 2024, the fastest pace since early 2023. This growth was up from 3.7% in the previous quarter. The economy also benefitted from government spending and continued investment, although business investment slowed, particularly in equipment spending, which fell sharply after two strong quarters.Matthew Martin, senior US economist at Oxford Economics, said, ""Consumers have been the foundation of the economy, and they've been the biggest driver of resilient growth in 2024,"" as quoted by the AFP news agency. He believes this growth will continue, supported by low layoffs, healthy job growth, and rising wages.The report also showed ongoing inflation. The Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index, rose by 2.3% in the fourth quarter, up from 1.5% in the third quarter. Core PCE, which excludes food and energy, increased by 2.5%, slightly up from 2.2% in the previous quarter.Despite these inflation pressures, the economy remained strong. A key part of GDP, which excludes volatile items like exports and inventories, grew by 3.2% in the third quarter, down from 3.4% in the previous quarter.President Donald Trump, who took office in January 2025, inherited a strong economy, with growth continuing despite high interest rates. Unemployment was 4.1% in December, and job gains stayed steady. The Federal Reserve kept its interest rate unchanged in December, after cutting it three times since September. Fed Chair Jerome Powell was quoted as saying to the Associated Press, “We do not need to be in a hurry to make more cuts,” due to the economy’s strength.The US economy is growing strongly, while Europe is struggling, having seen zero growth at the end of last year. The European Central Bank recently lowered its benchmark rate due to weak performance. In the US, strong consumer spending, low unemployment, and rising wages have helped maintain growth, despite ongoing inflation concerns.Trump has promised to cut taxes and reduce business regulations, but his plans on tariffs and immigration might slow growth and raise prices. KPMG's chief economist, Diane Swonk, pointed out that the effects of these policies will take time. While some analysts expect growth to slow in 2025, they still believe the US economy will remain strong for now.","US economy grew by 2.3% in the fourth quarter, slightly below the 2.4% that economists had expected.

Tesla reported lower than expected profits Wednesday but confirmed key 2025 benchmarks, saying it will return to sales volume growth and move forward with fully autonomous driving.The results -- the first since the return of Tesla CEO Elon Musk's ally Donald Trump to the White House -- capped a mixed year for Tesla in which Musk's big bet on US electoral politics was countered by profit pressures as Tesla's streak of annual car volume growth came to an end.The electric car company reported fourth-quarter profits of $2.3 billion, down 71 percent from the year-ago quarter, where profits were boosted by a one-time tax benefit.Revenues rose two percent to $25.7 billion, also missing analyst estimates, but reflecting a more than doubling of sales in energy generation and storage.Musk has sought to temper expectations about Tesla's near-term financial growth, while employing superlatives in touting Tesla's autonomous driving and robotic ventures, saying they could make Tesla ""the most valuable company in the world by far,"" worth more than the ""next five companies combined.""Musk, who spent some $270 million or more to help Trump win the White House, largely steered clear of political subjects during the 65-minute conference call.The company has been confronted by intensifying EV competition in leading markets, including China and the United States, where General Motors and Ford have introduced more models.Another factor has been lower sales than expected from the Cybertruck, Musk's futuristic auto giant that has won cheers from Tesla fans and jeers from critics.But Tesla expects growth in 2025, saying in its earnings release that ""with the advancements in vehicle autonomy and the introduction of new products, we expect the vehicle business to return to growth in 2025.""The company confirmed plans to unveil new, more affordable vehicles in 2025 and said its launch of a new robotaxi venture in parts of the United States was on track to begin this year.Tesla named its driver-assistance programs ""autopilot"" and ""full self-driving"" (FSD), even though the programs require the driver to maintain attention, while rival robotaxi venture Waymo has achieved full driverless functionality in three US cities so far.Musk has repeatedly missed earlier targets towards full autonomy, quipping during Wednesday that he was like the boy who cried wolf.""But I'm telling you, there's a damn wolf this time, and you can drive it,"" Musk said. ""In fact, it can drive you. It's a self-driving wolf.""Musk said he intends to launch FSD as a paid service in Austin, Texas this year, where the company also plans to introduce robotaxi services.""Teslas will be in the wild,"" he said, describing a gradual expansion of service once the company can demonstrate its autonomous service is ""unequivocally safer"" than a human driver.Musk did not directly comment on how his alliance with Trump will affect Tesla.The billionaire's widening influence and activism on behalf of far-right political movements has drawn rising attention and blowback. Polling data released Wednesday by YouGov showed Musk with a 44 percent favorable public opinion compared with a 48 percent negative.That's a worse ratio than Trump, who came in at three points net-positive, according to YouGov.A coalition that includes a public workers union has filed a lawsuit to block Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, arguing the panel flouts federal laws and is ""beset"" by the conflicts of interest of an extremist ""libertarian billionaire class.""And only days after being criticized for a hand gesture at Trump's inauguration that resembled a Nazi salute, Musk drew scrutiny last weekend for reiterating support for Germany's far-right, anti-immigrant AfD party, including comments that young Germans should feel able ""to move beyond"" expressing regret for the Holocaust.During the call, Musk's most overtly political comment concerned what he described as the cumbersome process to introduce FSD in Europe, calling Europe ""a layer cake of regulations and bureaucracy, which really needs to be addressed.""Shares of Tesla rose 4.4 percent in after-hours trading.","Tesla reports fourth-quarter profits of $2.3 billion, down 71 percent from the year-ago quarter.

DeepSeek: How a nerd with ‘terrible haircut’ shook up Silicon Valley's AI race,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/deepseek-how-a-nerd-with-terrible-haircut-shook-up-silicon-valleys-ai-race/articleshow/117693138.cms,"The independent research group envisioned by High-Flyer took shape as DeepSeek. High-Flyer's founder and controlling shareholder, Liang Wenfeng, also serves as DeepSeek's discreet leader.

Poll Do You Believe DeepSeek's Success Will Lead to More Global AI Competition? No, Nvidia Will Continue to Lead Yes, It Could Disrupt the Current AI Market

Why it matters

DeepSeek’s AI is more than just another chatbot—it’s a symbol of China’s growing technological self-sufficiency. Its breakthrough challenges the long-standing assumption that the US holds an insurmountable lead in artificial intelligence.

At the core of US confidence was the belief that China needed American technology—particularly advanced semiconductors from Nvidia—to train competitive AI models. To maintain its dominance, Washington banned the export of high-end AI chips to China in 2022 and further tightened restrictions in 2023. Many assumed these moves would kneecap China’s AI ambitions.

Yet, DeepSeek has shattered that certainty. The company claims it trained its AI model using only 2,000 Nvidia chips , whereas OpenAI and Google typically require 16,000+ chips for comparable models. Even more astonishingly, OpenAI reportedly spent $1 billion on training ChatGPT, while DeepSeek did it with just about $6 million.

, whereas OpenAI and Google typically require 16,000+ chips for comparable models. Even more astonishingly, OpenAI reportedly spent $1 billion on training ChatGPT, while DeepSeek did it with just about $6 million. If these claims hold true, it could fundamentally reshape the AI industry. The assumption that cutting-edge AI requires enormous computing power, billion-dollar investments, and thousands of advanced chips may no longer be valid. Instead, DeepSeek has demonstrated that a highly efficient approach to AI training could level the playing field—allowing smaller players, and even adversarial nations, to catch up quickly.

Between the lines: How did DeepSeek pull this off?

1. A different approach to AI training:

This is akin to a search engine librarian:

2. A strategic stockpile of Nvidia chips

3. China’s ‘AI super geeks’ approach

A Trojan horse?

The rise of DeepSeek raises a troubling question for Washington: Could this technology be a Trojan horse? Under Chinese law, all tech companies are required to “cooperate with national intelligence efforts.” This means that any data fed into DeepSeek’s chatbot could, in theory, be accessible to the Chinese state.

Some analysts fear that DeepSeek’s chatbot could function as an AI-powered intelligence-gathering tool, subtly siphoning off user information under the guise of casual interactions. Others point to its built-in political censorship—when asked about topics such as the Tiananmen Square massacre or China’s treatment of Uyghurs, DeepSeek either refuses to answer or echoes the Chinese government’s official stance.

With TikTok already under scrutiny in the US for alleged data harvesting, DeepSeek’s explosive rise is triggering similar concerns. The White House’s AI task force is reportedly investigating whether the platform poses a national security risk. “We should be alarmed,” said Ross Burley, co-founder of the Centre for Information Resilience. “Beijing has repeatedly weaponized its tech dominance for surveillance, control, and coercion,” Burley told Guardian.

What they’re saying

DeepSeek’s sudden rise has sparked polarizing reactions across the tech world:

President Donald Trump: Called DeepSeek a ""wake-up call"" for US industries, warning that China’s AI leap could threaten American economic and national security.

Sam Altman (OpenAI CEO): Praised DeepSeek as “impressive” and welcomed the competition, despite previously framing AI development as a battle between democracy and authoritarianism.

Elon Musk: Expressed doubts, suggesting that DeepSeek downplayed its use of banned US chips.

US National Security Officials: Are now investigating potential data security risks, given that DeepSeek stores user data on servers in China—raising concerns about state surveillance.

What’s next?

DeepSeek’s rise throws a wrench into Washington’s AI strategy. The US has aggressively restricted China’s access to advanced AI chips, believing that these controls would slow Beijing’s progress. But DeepSeek’s breakthrough suggests that China has found ways to innovate despite these restrictions.

Stronger US export controls : The Trump administrations will likely tighten AI-related export bans.

Bottom line

China’s AI industry has delivered a seismic shock to the world. DeepSeek , a little-known startup, has unveiled a generative AI model that is reportedly as powerful as OpenAI’s ChatGPT—but developed at a fraction of the cost. This breakthrough, described by Silicon Valley investor Marc Andreessen as a ""Sputnik moment,"" has rattled global tech markets.The fallout was immediate.US tech stocks suffered a bloodbath, losing nearly $1 trillion in value in a single day. Nvidia, the world’s most valuable chipmaker, saw $589 billion wiped off its market capitalization in what is now the largest one-day loss for any company in US history. The panic was fueled by fears that China’s AI could compete—and even surpass—US advancements while circumventing Washington’s chip restrictions.DeepSeek’s rise represents a stunning reversal of expectations. Just two years ago, China’s AI scene was seen as lagging behind the US. Beijing’s early attempts at ChatGPT-like models, such as Baidu’s Ernie and Tencent’s Hunyuan, were dismissed as inferior copies. Now, DeepSeek has positioned itself as a real contender, proving that China’s AI talent and research ecosystem are capable of groundbreaking innovation.DeepSeek’s success hinges on an unconventional training method. Traditional AI models process vast amounts of data, requiring massive computational resources. DeepSeek’s approach is different—it prioritizes knowing where to look for answers rather than memorizing everything.Traditional AI models behave like a librarian who has read every book in the library and pulls from memory to answer questions. DeepSeek’s model doesn’t read every book in advance. Instead, it quickly finds the right book when asked a question—a more efficient and cost-effective approach. This technique, combined with a “mixture of experts” strategy—which assigns specialized AI models to different types of questions—dramatically reduces the computing power needed to train AI.While the US tried to block China from accessing advanced AI chips, DeepSeek found a loophole. Before Washington closed the door in 2023, DeepSeek and other Chinese firms stockpiled tens of thousands of Nvidia’s A100 and H800 chips.These chips, though slightly less powerful than Nvidia’s cutting-edge H100, were still good enough for training DeepSeek’s AI. Some experts, including Elon Musk, have speculated that DeepSeek may have secretly acquired more high-end chips than disclosed.The brains behind DeepSeek is a 39-year-old Chinese hedge funder named Liang Wenfeng . As per a CNN report, in interviews with the state-linked financial outlet Yicai, early business associates described the future DeepSeek founder as somewhat “nerdy” and recalled “a terrible haircut” he once had.Liang Wenfeng believes in hiring fresh graduates over experienced professionals. His rationale?Experienced engineers follow conventional approaches. Young engineers are more willing to experiment and think outside the box. This philosophy appears to have worked. Liang’s team of under 140 researchers—mostly graduates from China’s elite universities—designed a breakthrough AI system in record time. Their success has boosted morale in China’s tech industry, with Liang now celebrated as one of China’s ""AI heroes.""DeepSeek’s AI breakthrough signals a shift in the global AI landscape. While it’s unclear if China will ultimately overtake the US in AI, one thing is certain: Silicon Valley’s AI monopoly is no longer guaranteed.(With inputs from agencies)","DeepSeek claims it trained its AI model using only 2,000 Nvidia chips, whereas OpenAI and Google typically require 16,000+ chips for comparable models.

'DeepSeek DID NOT build OpenAI for USD 5M' : Bernstein dismisses the Chinese company's claims,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/deepseek-did-not-build-openai-for-usd-5m-bernstein-dismisses-the-chinese-companys-claims/articleshow/117678472.cms,"Was it really $ 5 million?

DeepSeek, a new AI company seen as a potential rival to OpenAI, has gained massive success across social media, sending global stock markets into a frenzy. However, a recent report by Bernstein cautioned that while the company’s achievements are impressive, the claims of building an AI system comparable to OpenAI for just $5 million are not true.The report said that the claim is misleading and does not reflect the bigger picture.Bernstein stated, ""We believe that DeepSeek DID NOT ""build OpenAI for USD 5M""; the models look fantastic but we don't think they are miracles; and the resulting Twitter-verse panic over the weekend seems overblown"".The report said that DeepSeek developed two main AI models: the DeepSeek-V3 and DeepSeek R1. The V3 model, a large language model, utilises a mixture-of-experts (MOE) architecture, which combines multiple smaller models to achieve high performance while using fewer computing resources than traditional large models.On the other hand, the V3 model boasts 671 billion parameters, with 37 billion active at any given time, and incorporated with innovations like multi-head latent attention (MHLA) to reduce memory usage and mixed-precision training with FP8 computation for greater efficiency.Training the V3 model involved a cluster of 2,048 NVIDIA H800 GPUs over a two-month period which sums up around 5.5 million GPU hours.While some estimates put the training cost at approximately $ 5 million, the report highlighted that this figure only considers the computational resources, leaving out the significant costs related to research, experimentation, and other developmental expenses.The DeepSeek R1 model builds upon the V3’s foundation by using Reinforcement Learning (RL) and other techniques to enhance reasoning capabilities. The R1 model has performed competitively with OpenAI’s models in reasoning tasks. However, Bernstein pointed out that the additional resources required to develop the R1 model were substantial, though not detailed in DeepSeek’s research paper.Commenting on the hype, Bernstein noted that DeepSeek's models are impressive.For example, the V3 model performs as well as or better than other large models in language, coding, and mathematics while consuming a fraction of the computational resources. Pre-training the V3 model required just 2.7 million GPU hours, or only 9 per cent of the compute resources needed for some leading models.In conclusion, while DeepSeek’s advancements are noteworthy, the report urged caution in the face of exaggerated claims. While the company’s work is groundbreaking, the notion of creating an OpenAI competitor for just $ 5 million appears to be false.","DeepSeek, a new AI company seen as a potential rival to OpenAI, has gained massive success across social media, sending global stock markets into a frenzy.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume.While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

The Series A funding round was led by Lightspeed Venture Partners , and participants included Silicon Valley billionaire Vinod Khosla’s Khosla Ventures and Peak XV Partners , formerly Sequoia Capital India & Southeast Asia, Sarvam said Thursday.The Bangalore-based startup, until recently in stealth mode, was co-founded by Vivek Raghavan and Pratyush Kumar. It has ambitious plans to build open source foundational AI systems as well as tools for creating apps for the meager compute infrastructure available to developers in India. The startup has a total of 18 employees and is just opening an office in the city.""What we are showing is that you can build large language models with limited resources,” Raghavan said in a phone interview. ""We are building at a smaller scale and demonstrating that these can be extremely cost and energy efficient so they can be accessed by everyone.""Large language models, like OpenAI’s GPT-4 and Meta Platforms Inc.’s Llama, are powerful AI systems that understand by learning from vast amounts of diverse data from the internet and elsewhere to summarize, translate, and create text, audio and video for a wide range of applications.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor ( CEA ) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart.

That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says.

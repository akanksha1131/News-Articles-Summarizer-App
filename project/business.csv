Trump-Musk feud continues? White House orders review of SpaceX contracts after fallout: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/trump-musk-feud-continues-white-house-orders-review-of-spacex-contracts-after-fallout-report/articleshow/121841289.cms,"Elon Musk with Donald Trump in Oval office (File photo)

The White House instructed the Defense Department and Nasa earlier this month to examine details of SpaceX contracts worth billions following President Donald Trump's public disagreement with Elon Musk , according to four sources familiar with the directive who spoke to Reuters.The administration instructed these agencies to examine Musk's contracts to prepare potential actions against the entrepreneur and his enterprises, these sources indicated. Pentagon officials are also evaluating whether to limit SpaceX's involvement in a new American missile defence initiative, as Reuters reported on Thursday.While the ultimate intention regarding SpaceX's current federal contracts worth approximately $22 billion remains unclear, the assessment will mark the administration's follow-through on Trump's June 6 statement to journalists aboard Air Force One, where he mentioned possible termination of business and subsidies for Musk's ventures, stating ""We'll take a look at everything.""A White House spokesperson, responding via email to Reuters, avoided specific questions about Musk's operations, stating the ""Trump administration is committed to a rigorous review process for all bids and contracts."" Nasa's spokesperson separately indicated the agency would maintain collaboration with industry partners to achieve presidential space objectives.Sources familiar with the directive indicated the contract review aims to enable swift administrative action should Trump decide to move against Musk, who previously served as a senior presidential adviser and led the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).One source characterised the review as ""for political ammunition.""The feasibility of legally cancelling existing contracts remains uncertain. However, the situation highlights governance experts' worries about political and personal influences potentially affecting government spending, national security and public interest matters.Another Reuters report on Friday cited three people familiar with the project, claiming that the feud called into question the role of Musk's SpaceX in the new US missile defense system. Until recently, the White House considered a plan for SpaceX, Musk's rocket and satellite venture, to partner with software maker Palantir and drone builder Anduril to construct crucial elements of the project, dubbed ""Golden Dome. "" These people said the administration instructed the Pentagon to prioritize a network of satellites for the purpose.A new framework aimed at tracking and preventing potential missile attacks against the United States is currently under consideration, which could reduce SpaceX's involvement. Three individuals stated that one option might initially forego SpaceX's satellite capabilities to focus on expanding existing ground-based missile defence systems instead.Scott Amey, a contracting specialist at Washington's Project on Government Oversight, noted the situation's paradox, where Musk's contracts face similar subjective political scrutiny that his DOGE team applied to numerous other contracts, emphasising that decisions should prioritise public and national security interests over personal disputes.SpaceX has become essential to American government aerospace and defence operations, managing satellite launches and potentially overseeing a crucial component of Trump's ""Golden Dome"" missile defence system.Despite Musk's recent attempts to moderate his presidential criticisms, including his (now-deleted posts) impeachment call and allegations linking Trump to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, his outbursts highlighted government dependence on SpaceX.Before his reversal, Musk suggested decommissioning the Dragon spacecraft, currently America's sole means of transporting astronauts to and from the International Space Station under a £5 billion Nasa contract.Additionally, SpaceX is developing a classified satellite network for the National Reconnaissance Office, strengthening its relationship with American defence and intelligence communities.The feud between Musk and Trump intensified after the Tesla owner criticised Trump’s key domestic bill, describing it as a “disgusting abomination” and alleging that Trump’s name appeared in unreleased Jeffrey Epstein files—a post Musk subsequently deleted. In response, Trump called Musk “a big-time drug addict” and mocked his appearance during a recent Oval Office visit.However, the tensions seemed to ease when Musk expressed ""regret"" saying he went too far. “I regret some of my posts about President @realDonaldTrump last week. They went too far,” Musk wrote Wednesday on the platform he owns. In response, the White House signalled a possible softening of tone. “The President acknowledged the statement that Elon put out this morning, and he is appreciative of it,” Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters.",The White House instructed the Defense Department and Nasa earlier this month to examine details of SpaceX contracts worth billions.

"From golf to crypto: Trump declares over $600 million income, $1.6 billion in total assets, claims report",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/from-golf-to-crypto-trump-declares-over-600-million-income-1-6-billion-in-total-assets-claims-report/articleshow/121843615.cms,"Donald Trump (File photo)

In a financial disclosure report released on Friday, Donald Trump declared over $600 million in earnings from various ventures including cryptocurrency , golf establishments, licensing agreements and other business interests, reported Reuters.The financial report, apparently covering the 2024 calendar year, indicates that the president's cryptocurrency investments significantly enhanced his wealth, alongside substantial development fees and revenue from other enterprises. The president's total declared assets amount to at least $1.6 billion, according to Reuters calculations.Despite Trump's assertion that his business interests are managed by a trust under his children's supervision, the disclosures reveal that income from these sources ultimately benefits the president, raising concerns about potential conflicts of interest.Certain business ventures, particularly in cryptocurrency, have benefited from policy changes under his administration, drawing criticism.The financial disclosure, reportedly signed on June 13, did not specify its coverage period. However, the cryptocurrency details and other information suggest coverage through December 2024, excluding most earnings from the family's recent cryptocurrency ventures.The document represents a specific moment in time, capturing the family's initial foray into cryptocurrency while maintaining their traditional interests in property development and golf establishments.The president's meme coin, $TRUMP, launched this year, has generated approximately $320 million in fees, though the distribution between Trump-controlled entities and partners remains unclear.Beyond meme coin earnings, the Trump family has accumulated over $400 million from World Liberty Financial, a decentralised finance organisation. Their portfolio also includes bitcoin mining operations and digital asset exchange-traded funds.The disclosures show Trump received $57.35 million from World Liberty token sales and holds 15.75 billion governance tokens in the venture.The Republican president's wealth spans cryptocurrency to real estate, with a significant portion linked to his stake in Trump Media & Technology Group, which owns Truth Social.Beyond business venture assets and revenues, the president reported minimum earnings of $12 million from passive investments totalling at least $211 million, including interest and dividends, according to Reuters calculations.His primary investments were in Blue Owl Capital Corp and government bond funds managed by Charles Schwab and Invesco.The disclosure provided value ranges for assets and income; Reuters used minimum values, suggesting higher actual totals.The report also detailed income from various Florida properties. His three golf resorts - Jupiter, Doral and West Palm Beach - plus Mar-a-Lago members' club generated minimum earnings of $217.7 million.Trump National Doral, featuring the Blue Monster course, proved the family's highest income source at $110.4 million. These figures represent revenue rather than net profit.The disclosure highlighted international business interests, including $5 million in Vietnamese development licence fees, $10 million from an Indian project, and nearly $16 million in Dubai licensing fees.Additional royalties came from various sources: $1.3 million from the Greenwood Bible (""the only Bible officially endorsed by Lee Greenwood and President Trump""); $2.8 million from Trump Watches; and $2.5 million from Trump Sneakers and Fragrances.Trump earned $1.16 million from NFT digital trading cards, while First Lady Melania Trump received approximately $216,700 from her NFT collection licensing fees.","Donald Trump declared over $600 million in earnings from various ventures including cryptocurrency, golf establishments, licensing agreements and other business interests.

Gold price prediction today: MCX Gold August 2025 contract has opened with a spectacular gap up at ₹100,300, marking a massive surge of over 1,800 points from previous levels. This dramatic move is likely triggered by overnight geopolitical tensions on Israel attacks on Iran Nuclear sites. Dollar weakness at 98$, has created a new bullish paradigm for the precious metal. While the gap up presents immediate profit opportunities, seasoned traders are positioning for strategic buy-on-dips entries.The ₹99,000 level, coinciding with the 21-day EMA, represents the most logical support zone for dip buying in this new bullish environment. This level offers multiple confluence factors:1. EMA 21 Support: The 21-period moving average at ₹99,000 provides dynamic support2. Psychological Level: Round number support with strong psychological significance3. Gap Fill Protection: Sufficient distance from gap opening to avoid immediate fill4. Volume Profile: High volume acceptance above ₹99,000 during previous sessions5. Fibonacci Support: 50% retracement of recent rally from ₹97,500 to current levelsThe gap up opening in gold has created a paradigm shift from resistance-based selling to support-based buying strategies. The ₹99,000 level offers an exceptional risk-reward opportunity for traders looking to capitalize on this momentum breakout. However, the elevated volatility demands disciplined execution and strict adherence to risk management protocols.The technical setup strongly favors buyers on any weakness, with multiple confluence factors supporting the ₹99,000 zone. Traders should remain patient, wait for the market to come to them, and execute the strategy with precision when the opportunity presents itself.","Gap up opening in gold has created a paradigm shift from resistance-based selling to support-based buying strategies.

Japan: Nikkei recovers amid safe-haven Yen weakness

Asia-Pacific: Regional equities stabilize amid oil jitters

Global outlook

Asian stock markets showed early signs of recovery on Monday following sharp losses last week triggered by intensifying hostilities between Israel and Iran. Investor sentiment remains cautious as the risk of prolonged conflict in the Middle East threatens oil supplies, inflation dynamics, and monetary policy outlooks globally.Brent crude prices surged by as much as 5.5 per cent, while safe-haven currencies and assets showed mixed responses. The Japanese yen weakened, and Bloomberg’s dollar index edged slightly higher. Market participants are also watching for upcoming interest rate decisions from major central banks including the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan.

Safra Sarasin, said: “Markets should be prepared for a prolonged period of uncertainty. Hedging against oil supply-chain disruptions through energy exposure and gold, which may accelerate its structural uptrend, are prudent portfolio strategies.”Beyond the Middle East, investors are also grappling with additional headwinds including fragile global trade ties, possible tariff hikes under President Trump, the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, and rising US political unrest amid nationwide protests.","Nifty50 and BSE Sensex open higher amid global market caution.

CHENNAI/MUMBAI: India Cements' new promoter, UltraTech Cement, will need to sell about 7 per cent of its stake, worth over Rs 667 crore, to meet the minimum public shareholding rules set by the capital market regulator. UltraTech currently owns about 82 per cent of India Cements, and the rules mandate that listed companies must have at least 25 per cent of their shares owned by the public.UltraTech's stake went over 75 per cent after an open offer that was triggered when its holdings in India Cements crossed a specific threshold. The open offer for an extra 26 per cent stake to India Cements' public shareholders was oversubscribed, which was rare in such offers.India Cements has until Feb 3, 2026, to ensure enough shares are held by the public. It can do this through a secondary share sale, preferential allotment, rights issue, or bonus issue. If it chooses rights or bonus issues, UltraTech will need to give up its rights to buy those shares. Currently, India Cements shares are trading at Rs 333 each, making the 7 per cent stake worth Rs 667 crore.An UltraTech spokesperson said according to Sebi regulations, at least 25 per cent of India Cements' equity must be held by the public within 12 months after the open offer ends, which was on February 4 of this year.""UltraTech will ensure compliance within the stipulated timeline.""Data from Prime Infobase showed that in FY25, more than a dozen companies saw promoter holdings drop from over 75 per cent to 75 per cent or less. These companies include Sanghi Industries under Adani Group, Aditya Birla Sun Life AMC, Bikaji Foods International, and Cello World. UltraTech, part of the Aditya Birla conglomerate, took control of the loss-making India Cements in the Christmas of 2024.

MUMBAI: India's largest lender, State Bank of India, has cut returns for depositors again. Effective June 15, the bank reduced interest rates on retail term deposits of up to Rs 3 crore by 25 basis points across tenures. Simultaneously, it brought down the savings account rate to 2.5 per cent, its lowest ever. These cuts apply to both new and renewing deposits, reflecting a wider easing in deposit yields after the RBI reduced the repo rate by 50 basis points earlier this month.The rationale behind the uniform cut is protect the bank's margins. Around 45 per cent of SBI's Rs 36 lakh crore loan book is linked to the repo rate. These include home loans (Rs 8.3 lakh crore) and auto loans (Rs 1.2 lakh crore). The bank's best home loan rates for new loans are now 7.5 per cent.The cut in the benchmark rate is estimated to lower the bank's annual interest income by about Rs 8,100 crore. Reducing savings deposit rates is the most immediate way for SBI to limit that hit. The cut in savings deposit rates, in particular, provides quicker relief. With Rs 23 lakh crore in such accounts, the lower payout enables the bank to save an estimated Rs 5,750 crore annually.SBI is not alone. HDFC Bank recently trimmed its savings account rate on high-value deposits to a flat 2.75 per cent across balances and lowered fixed deposit rates by up to 25 basis points.ICICI Bank, Canara Bank, and YES Bank have also cut fixed deposit rates. These moves aim to protect net interest margins at a time when credit growth is moderating. For depositors, it marks yet another reduction in already low returns.The deregulation of savings rates had raised hopes of more competition among banks, but the trend has gone the other way.SBI's savings rate, which was 4 per cent in the early 2000s, slipped to 3.5 per cent by 2003, fell further over the next decade, and hit 2.7 per cent by 2020.","India's largest lender, State Bank of India, has cut returns for depositors again.

BENGALURU: India's maturing capital markets are prompting digital-first companies to shift their headquarters back to the country. A white paper from Bay Capital Investment Advisors highlights this ""reverse flipping"" phenomenon, where startups previously registered in countries like the US, Singapore, or the Netherlands are returning to India, showcasing increased faith in domestic markets, regulatory improvements, and a broader investor base.Approximately 40 Indian consumer internet and technology firms have domestic listings, with their collective market value reaching $90 billion. Several prominent firms including PhonePe, Groww, Zepto, Flipkart, Razorpay, Pine Labs, Udaan, Meesho, KreditBee, and InMobi have flipped or considered a return, with plans to list on Indian exchanges.Several elements contribute to this transformation. Indian investors have developed expertise in assessing digital enterprises using metrics such as customer acquisition cost (CAC), lifetime value (LTV), and user retention. Market regulator Sebi's reforms have enabled high-growth companies, despite losses, to access public markets. Enhanced participation from mutual funds, pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, and family offices has strengthened the investment landscape.Public listings have increased significantly. During 2024, 327 firms raised Rs 1.5 lakh crore through public offerings, compared to Rs 20,628 crore in 2020.Notable digital enterprises, including Swiggy, FirstCry, Ola Electric, Unicommerce, and TBO Tek, launched their public offerings, demonstrating investor interest in technology-driven growth opportunities.Bay Capital identifies India's highly sophisticated digital infrastructure-UPI, Aadhaar, ONDC, and Account Aggregator framework as crucial drivers.The trend extends beyond the consumer internet. India's deep technology sector is expanding, with ventures in AI, quantum computing, space technology, and enterprise software securing substantial funding. Nasscom-Zinnov data indicates deep tech startups secured $1.6 billion across 310 deals in 2024, rising 78% year-on-year, with AI representing nearly half the investment.While Bay Capital maintains optimism about India's digital and technological future, it advocates careful investment selection. The report emphasises that ""robust business models, distinctive competitive advantages, healthy organisational culture, and sustainable profitable growth remain essential when evaluating potential investments"" in the country.","Approximately 40 Indian consumer internet and technology firms have domestic listings.

DEHRADUN/NEW DELHI: Manoj Sharma doesn't fly by the book in the Kedarnath sector — he flies by sight, by wind, by instinct. ""We are flying in one of the world's most unforgiving regions with very little real-time weather support,"" he said. ""Operations in such large numbers are being conducted on pilot observation and visual reference. The weather is very unpredictable and changes very rapidly.""That reality, long known to those in the cockpit, now has the country's attention. In just six weeks, Uttarakhand has recorded five helicopter accidents — two of them fatal, others involving emergency landings and rotor damage — all on the Kedar route. In one case, a Kestrel Aviation helicopter crash-landed near a road after a mechanical failure, injuring the pilot and damaging a vehicle.This is not an outlier year. In 2022, an Aryan Aviation chopper crashed near Kedarnath, killing seven. In 2023, Uttarakhand Civil Aviation Development Authority (UCADA) finance controller Amit Saini died after being struck by a tail rotor. And in 2013, a military rescue helicopter went down during flood relief, killing 20.The terrain is tough — but it is not the only challenge. The system built to manage it is, in many ways, still catching up to the traffic it supports.Pilgrimage flights have surged over the past decade, but the region lacks a dedicated air traffic control network.""There is no ATC control nor any weather station in these areas,"" said a veteran pilot. ""Flying in the narrow valley from Gaurikund to Kedarnath needs a lot of experience and safety awareness, as there are no landing sites on this stretch that can be used in an emergency or bad weather."" Another pilot added, ""There is no information provided on routes where major helicopter operations take place. Till such time these issues can't be addressed, these operations should immediately be stopped. ""This month, the civil aviation ministry suspended Aryan Aviation from Char Dham operations and grounded two TransBharat pilots who flew in unsuitable weather, suspending their licences for six months.UCADA — established by the state in 2013 to oversee civil aviation development and safety, including helipad infrastructure and coordination with private operators — has been tasked with conducting a comprehensive review with all operators and setting up a command-and-control room to monitor real-time risks. DGCA has deployed officers to oversee safety, airworthiness and the functioning of the control centre.But many in the sector say these moves fall short. ""It seems there are no checks and balances in place,"" said one chopper operator. ""There is someone who replaced one inoperative part on a chopper with another inoperative part from another chopper to show that the part has been changed. Because of unscrupulous operators, conscientious operators and passengers are suffering.""Others point to a deeper culture of pressure and compromise. ""There have been five chopper crashes in the country within the last 1.5 months, which is the worst we have ever seen in helicopter operations in our country,"" said a senior pilot. ""Char Dham operations are one of the toughest... yet we still fly as if nothing needs fixing.""Another pilot was more direct: ""We need a complete stop on chopper operations for this yatra season. All stakeholders — owners, pilots, commercial, engineers, DGCA and UCADA — need to look within and change."" One added, simply, ""It's greed. That's what's driving this. Not safety.""","In just six weeks, Uttarakhand has recorded five helicopter accidents. Two of them fatal, others involving emergency landings and rotor damage.

MUMBAI: The Iran-Israel conflict and its repercussions on global markets and crude oil prices are expected to weigh on investors on Dalal Street when markets open today. With TA35, Israel's main index, showing strong resistance in mid-session on Sunday, domestic investors may not see frenetic selling during Monday's opening trades, market players said.In addition, investors will have to consider a host of other factors, such as rate decisions by at least three major central banks, the Federal Reserve in the US, the Bank of Japan, and the Bank of England.Market players will also keep an eye on the minutes of the RBI's policy meeting of June 6, which will be released this week, the progress of the monsoon, and the FII trading trend. On Friday, after the news broke that Israel attacked Iran and the latter retaliated, Sensex and Nifty dipped sharply but recovered through the session, each closing about 0.7% down. Sensex was at 81,119 points, while Nifty was at 24,719 points.According to Ajit Mishra of Religare Broking, markets are likely to remain volatile due to the ongoing geopolitical uncertainty in West Asia and the key central bank meetings.""The US Federal Reserve's upcoming policy decision will be closely tracked, as global market participants look for clarity on the timing and magnitude of potential rate cuts, especially in light of mixed economic signals.""","The Iran-Israel conflict and its repercussions on global markets are expected to weigh on investors on Dalal Street when markets open today.

JERUSALEM: Indian billionaire Gautam Adani-led group's Haifa port in Israel was unharmed by the Iranian ballistic missile attack, with cargo operations progressing unhampered, sources said.Late on Saturday night, Iran targeted Israel's Haifa port and a nearby oil refinery in response to Tel Avi's attack on Iranian nuclear and other targets earlier this week.Sharpnels fell in the chemical terminal at the port and some other projectiles fell at the oil refinery, two sources aware of the matter said. They claimed there were no injuries.Adani's port, however, was not impacted by the strike.A piece of interceptor shrapnel was also found at the Kishan West (Haifa port) but there were no injuries, they said.Cargo operations at the Adani-operated port were unhampered. ""There are eight ships in the port now, cargo operations are normal,"" a source said.The Iranian ballistic missile attack did not inflict any damage to the port or its operations, the sources claimed.The Adani group did not immediately offer any comments on the issue. Israeli government authorities could not be immediately reached for comments.Haifa port is totally functioning normally, sources said, adding 8 ships were handling cargo as on Sunday.The port has approximately 700 employees. It handles different types of cargo, including containers, bulk, breakbulk, cement and general cargo.Sources said the port is closely coordinating with the ministry of transport in Israel and continue to operate normally with full compliance with security and other requirements of the Israeli government.The Chinese port (which is next to Haifia) is also functioning normally, sources said.Haifa port serves as a crucial maritime hub, handling over 30 per cent of Israel's imports. It is owned by Adani Ports, which controls a 70 per cent share.The missiles may have caused damage to a major oil refinery close to the port but there was no official comment on the impact on it.Haifa is less than 3 per cent of the volume handled by Adani Ports and SEZ and contributed less than 2 per cent to the profits. Haifa handles a total cargo of 10-11 million tonnes annually, while APSEZ annual volumes are upwards of 450 million tonnes.Israel attacked Iran early Friday, targeting its nuclear, missile and military infrastructure. Iran later launched retaliatory strikes on Israel. The two countries traded strikes for a third day on Sunday as the Middle East region braced for a protracted conflict.Iran said Israel struck two oil refineries, raising the prospect of a broader assault on Iran's heavily sanctioned energy industry that could affect global markets. Some Iranian missiles evaded Israeli air defences to strike buildings in the heart of the country.","Iran targeted Israel's Haifa port and a nearby oil refinery in response to Tel Avi's attack on Iranian nuclear and other targets earlier this week.

""The supply chain has probably had a small role in our slight reduction in deliveries over the next 20 years,"" said Boeing vice president of Commercial Marketing Darren Hulst during a briefing last week, as quoted by AFP.This announcement preceded the Air India Boeing 787 Dreamliner crash in Ahmedabad on Thursday. In response to the incident, which claimed 279 lives, Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg and commercial aircraft division head Stephanie Pope withdrew from the event.Boeing anticipates yearly passenger growth of 4.2 percent, surpassing the 2.3 percent annual GDP growth. ""New aircraft deliveries haven't been able to keep up with the demand,"" Hulst said, estimating a ""cumulative shortage"" of approximately 1,500 to 2,000 aircraft. However, Hulst believes delivery rates to improve through the remainder of this decade.Of the 43,600 new aircraft needed through 2044, about 21,100 will substitute existing aircraft whilst 22,500 will address increasing demand in China and emerging markets. These statistics demonstrate substantial growth from 2004's global fleet of 16,780 aircraft.The industry's transformation is evident as the top 10 aviation firms in 2004 represented 45 percent of the global fleet, predominantly North American and European companies.

US President Donald Trump has signed an executive order enabling Japanese firm Nippon Steel's investment in US Steel, contingent upon compliance with a government-mandated ""national security agreement"".The joint statement from both companies confirms $11 billion in new investments by 2028 and the provision of a ""golden share"" to the US government, ensuring protection of national security interests regarding steel production. They expressed gratitude to Trump's administration, highlighting the partnership's significance for American manufacturing.Following completion of regulatory approvals and Department of Justice review, the partnership awaits prompt finalisation. US Steel shares increased by $2.66 to $54.85 in Friday's afterhours trading, compared to Nippon Steel's initial bid of $55 per share in late 2023.The acquisition concludes the long-time uncertainty regarding international control of a crucial state resource that started when US Steel and Nippon Steel disclosed their intentions for a $14.9 billion merger in December 2023.Details regarding the golden share mechanism, national security agreement provisions and investment allocation remain limited.White House spokesman Kush Desai emphasised the order's role in maintaining US Steel's presence in Pennsylvania. Legal expert James Brower noted that such agreements typically remain confidential, particularly from the government's perspective.The transaction, originally valued at nearly $15 billion, faced delays due to national security concerns during Biden's presidency. American officials now value it at $28 billion, including the purchase bid and plans for a new electric arc furnace post-2028, reported AP.Nippon Steel committed to maintaining Pittsburgh headquarters, establishing an American-majority board, protecting plant operations and trade interests, while avoiding steel slab imports that would compete with US blast furnaces.Trump, initially opposing the purchase, later showed willingness to negotiate. He claimed ""total control"" through the golden share, though Nippon Steel maintains its intention for full ownership.The order acknowledges potential national security risks but suggests adequate mitigation through the security agreement. The Treasury Department and CFIUS agencies must approve the agreement's execution by the transaction's closing date, with Trump retaining authority for further actions.","US President Donald Trump has signed an executive order enabling Japanese firm Nippon Steel's investment in US Steel.

Similarly, the Model X AWD now costs $89,990, and the Model X Plaid is listed at $104,990, Reuters reported.Earlier, Elon Musk announced Tuesday that Tesla is ""tentatively"" launching its long-anticipated robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, on June 22. The move marks a significant leap in Tesla’s autonomous driving ambitions, with Musk emphasizing a cautious approach: “We are being super paranoid about safety, so the date could shift,” he said in a post on social media platform X.Musk also noted that the first Tesla to fully self-drive from the end of the production line to a customer’s home is scheduled for June 28—an industry-first if achieved.The vehicles involved in the rollout are reportedly unmodified Tesla Model Ys, built with the Full Self-Driving (FSD) software pre-installed and capable of operating without human intervention.A recent video circulating online showed a Model Y in Austin, branded with a “Robotaxi” logo, transporting a passenger without a driver onboard. Musk confirmed the footage, stating that ""every Tesla coming out of our factories is capable of unsupervised self-driving. ""This announcement brings Tesla closer to fulfilling a promise Musk has been making for years—commercializing fully autonomous vehicles. The initial rollout will reportedly include around 10 vehicles, operating under remote supervision and within a geofenced area. Musk said the service will quickly expand to other metro areas including Los Angeles, San Antonio, and San Francisco.","Tesla has increased prices of its Model S and Model X vehicles in the United States by $5,000.

The rebound follows five consecutive monthly declines and lifts the index from its second-lowest level in the survey’s nearly 75-year history. Despite the uptick, sentiment remains down 20% compared with December 2024.""Consumers appear to have settled somewhat from the shock of the extremely high tariffs announced in April and the policy volatility seen in the weeks that followed,” said Joanne Hsu, director of the survey, AP reported. “However, consumers still perceive wide-ranging downside risks to the economy.”The improvement comes after President Donald Trump postponed a sweeping round of tariffs on imports from roughly 60 countries in April and subsequently reached a truce with China last month. While tariffs remain elevated by historical standards, the White House has signaled a willingness to pause escalation pending further talks.The Conference Board’s Consumer Confidence Index — a separate metric released late last month — also showed improvement after five straight monthly declines, with analysts attributing the shift to easing fears over inflation and trade policy unpredictability.Official inflation data released earlier this week showed consumer prices rising 2.4% year-on-year in May, up slightly from 2.3% in April. While tariffs are expected to put further pressure on prices in the second half of the year, inflation remains close to the Federal Reserve’s 2% target for now.Sentiment remains sharply divided along political lines. Republicans, who broadly support Trump’s economic policies, continue to express stronger confidence than Democrats, whose views had been more optimistic under the Biden administration. However, sentiment improved across party lines in June, including among independents.Inflation expectations among consumers also declined in June — a development likely to be welcomed by the Federal Reserve ahead of its policy meeting next week.

Oil prices jumped nearly 8%, intensifying worries about supply constraints and their potential impact on the economy.The 10-year Treasury yield ticked higher to 4.385%, reflecting ongoing shifts in interest rate expectations. Currency markets also saw the dollar strengthen against the euro, signaling increased demand for US assets.Shares of oil companies like Chevron and oil services players such as Halliburton rallied as oil prices surged about eight percent following the Israeli strike, AFP reported.Meanwhile, Brazilian meat giant JBS shares fell 6% in early trading Friday as the company made its long-awaited debut on the New York Stock Exchange, AP reported.The listing marks a major milestone for JBS, which was founded 72 years ago and has grown into one of the world’s largest meat producers. The US is a critical market for the company, accounting for roughly half of its annual revenue and employing over 72,000 people. JBS is currently the largest beef producer in the US and ranks second in poultry and pork production.Global oil prices spiked sharply on Friday, triggering broader market volatility as escalating geopolitical tensions in the Middle East rattled investor sentiment and raised concerns over potential supply disruptions.US benchmark crude surged 7.1% to $72.88 per barrel, while Brent crude, the global benchmark, climbed 7.2% to $74.32. The gains came after Israel launched a pre-emptive military strike on Iranian facilities, stoking fears of a wider regional conflict that could curtail Iranian oil exports and keep energy prices elevated worldwide.Although Iran remains a major oil producer, ongoing Western sanctions have already limited its sales. Analysts at S&P Global Commodity Insights noted that past flare-ups between Iran and Israel have often led to brief spikes in oil prices, followed by reversals once the immediate threat of escalation passed. “This is an economic shock that nobody really needs, but it is one that seems more like a shock to sentiment than to the fundamentals of the economy,” said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management as quoted AP.United Airlines dropped 5.2%, Delta Air Lines fell 4.5%, and Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings slipped 2.9% as investors grew concerned about higher fuel costs and potential disruptions to travel demand. Adobe tumbled 5.7% despite beating Wall Street profit expectations, as analysts said investors were unimpressed with the company's forward guidance.In contrast, energy and defense stocks rallied. Exxon Mobil rose 2.2% and ConocoPhillips added 2.3%, supported by the oil rally. Defense contractors also gained, with Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman both up 2.3%, reflecting market anticipation of increased global defense spending.Gold climbed 1.8% to $3,463.70 per ounce, as risk-averse investors sought safety amid the geopolitical turmoil. However, Treasury prices fell, pushing yields higher, with the 10-year note edging up to 4.38% from 4.36%. The decline in bond prices, despite risk-off sentiment, reflected market fears that sustained high oil prices could reaccelerate inflation and constrain the Federal Reserve’s ability to cut interest rates later this year.Recent inflation data has shown moderation, but Trump’s sweeping tariffs and now the oil shock are seen as potential triggers for renewed price pressures. The Fed has maintained a cautious stance, holding rates steady this year after three cuts in 2024, as it monitors the twin risks of inflation and slowing growth.Overseas, market sentiment was similarly negative. Germany’s DAX fell 1.4%, and France’s CAC 40 dropped 1.1%, amid a broad retreat across European and Asian equity markets.","The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped over 480 points, down 1.12%, while the Nasdaq and S&P 500 also slipped.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume.

Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran Udaan until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.Udaan built an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business still accounts for a very small part of India’s overall retail market but can balloon to $150 billion in sales and yield a 100% return on capital invested in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co. estimates published in the Mint newspaper.Bengaluru-based Udaan has also ventured into financing through its fintech unit which helps shopkeepers get working capital loans to buy inventory. That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says.

SAR imagery provides much higher resolution than other forms of remote sensing technology such as hyperspectral and multispectral. SAR is a critical technology for strategic reconnaissance and planning as well as for disaster management.According to Misra, winning the challenge in just over a year of floating the company is a major booster.He said L and P band SAR have an advantage over other frequencies (like X band) when it comes to penetration capabilities through rain, clouds, foliage and vegetation in a tropical country like India, and underground penetration capabilities in dry terrain.Continuing further, he said the L band SAR will provide 1 metre resolution, spotlight resolution in Stripmap mode. The current industry standard is 5-10 metre in L band. Misra said both the L and P band will operate simultaneously from a satellite borne SAR. Recently, Sisir Radar successfully developed and tested the world’s highest resolution L-Band SAR fitted on a drone.

How India's GDP has been growing

What SBI report said on savings and investment

Incremental capital output ratio

NEW DELHI: India's gross domestic product (GDP) data for the third quarter (October-December 2022) received a word of caution from the former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan In an interview with news agency PTI, Rajan that India is ""dangerously close"" to the Hindu rate of growth in view of subdued private sector investment, high interest rates and slowing global growth.India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying"".However, a report released by the State Bank of India (SBI) economists on Tuesday dismissed arguments that India is dangerously close to Hindu rate of growth saying such statements are ""ill-conceived, biased and premature"".The term 'Hindu growth rate' was coined by late economist Raj Krishna in 1978 to describe the slow growth in the country.It basically refers to the low pace of economic growth rates during 1950s to 1980s. During this period, the Indian economy averaged 3.5%.A former lecturer at the Delhi School of Economics (DSE), Krishna noted that only if the rate of growth is persistently slow and accompanied by low per-capita GDP, then it will be known as Hindu rate of growth but it has to factor in population growth as well.Before economic reforms of 1991, India's economic growth remained stagnant and low, while per capita income averaged around 1.3%. Krishna termed this low growth situation to be a result of socialist policies of state control and import substitution.However, the economic situation changed when liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation (LPG) reforms came into effect in the year 1991, at a time when India faced balance of payment crisis.Over the years, many economists have strongly opposed the idea of 'Hindu growth rate' and the term never had universal acceptance.The Indian economy plunged into its very first technical recession in FY21 due to the impact of Covid-19 pandemic and the related nationwide lockdowns. GDP shrunk by an unprecedented 23.8% in the first quarter of the financial year 2020-21. However, due to spurt in economic activities in the subsequent quarters, the GDP decline started to narrow.However, if we look at the period before Covid-19 as well, India's growth curve shows a declining trend.From 8.26% in FY17, GDP growth plunged to 3.74% in FY20. Shutdown of economic activities in FY21 in wake of Covid-19 only made matters worse.As lockdowns started to ease and business activities resumed, India's GDP also started rising. In Q1 of FY22, growth jumped to 20.1% mainly on account of low base effect. By the fourth quarter of FY22, growth came down to 4.10%.Similarly, the new financial year 2022-23 brought fresh economic challenges in the form of Russia-Ukraine war that impacted almost all major economies of the world, slowed the pace of growth, pushed inflation to record highs.As a result, the central banks of all advanced economies spurred into action and opted for monetary policy tightening to curb the soaring inflation.With persistently rising interest rates, India's economy grew by 4.4% in Q3 of FY23, as the Centre revised upwards GDP growth for previous year to 9.10% from 8.7% earlier.The report weighed recent GDP numbers against the available data on savings and investments for the past decade and highlighted some interesting points.""Quarterly growth numbers are noisy and should be best avoided for any serious interpretation (on an average, India's GDP growth has witnessed Rs 2 lakh crore upward revision for the 3 year ended FY23),"" the report said.Gross capital formation (GCF) by the government touched a high of 11.8% in 2021-22, up from 10.7% in 2020-21.""This also had a domino effect on private sector investment that jumped from 10 per cent to 10.8% over the same period,"" it said.In fact, Ecowrap added that the trends in GCF to gross output ratio or the plough back of funds for creation of fresh capacity shows that for public administration the ratio attained fresh peak in 2021-22 owing to the emphasis on capital expenditure in recent budgets.At the aggregate level, gross capital formation is supposed to have crossed 32% in 2022-23, the highest level since 2018-19.According to the report, in 2021-22, gross savings have risen to 30% from 29% in 2020-21.""The ratio is supposed to have crossed 31 per cent in 2022-23, the highest since 2018-19. The household savings increased sharply during the pandemic period on account of sharp accretion in financial savings such as deposits,"" said the report by SBI's Economic Research Department.While household financial savings have since then moderated from 15.4% in 2020-21 to 11.1% in 2022-23, savings in physical assets have grown sharply to 11.8% in 2021-22 from 10.7% in 2020-21.The report further analysed Incremental Capital Output ratio (ICOR) -- which measures additional units of capital (investment) needed to produce additional units of output. It said that the ratio has been improving.""ICOR which was 7.5 in FY 12 is now only 3.5 in FY22. Clearly, only half of capital is now needed for next unit of output,"" the report noted.Such reducing ICOR in the current years reflects a relatively increasing efficiency of capital and shows that the economy is on a sound footing, the report said.""From that point of view, future GDP growth rates even at 7% could still mean a decent number by any standards!,"" it added.","India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.

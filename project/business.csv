Income Tax Department Crackdown

Income Tax Department’s extensive crackdown! Over the past 20 months, the Income Tax Department has collected Rs 37,000 crore from individuals who had taxable income but failed to file returns, according to officials.Officials analysed data on substantial transactions since 2019-20, including purchases of gems, jewellery, property and luxury holidays paid in cash. ""These are the cases where people were not filing tax returns despite making large purchases. The department had reached out to them over the past 20 months,"" a senior official informed ET.The official noted that an expanded and stricter tax collection and TDS system has helped identify significant transactions that previously went unnoticed.The official indicated that some individuals submitted returns claiming zero income despite substantial expenditure and tax obligations. From the total Rs 37,000 crore recovered, Rs 1,320 crore came from individuals involved in high-value transactions.The department is conducting an extensive initiative to contact taxpayers whose spending patterns do not align with their declared income.Since FY21, it has actively used data analytics and the Non-Filer Monitoring System to identify non-compliant individuals.""Data from multiple sources is being tapped and synchronised... This makes it easy for the department to identify such evasion and nab evaders,"" the official stated.Official data revealed that direct tax collections for April-November increased by 15.4% to Rs 12.10 lakh crore, comprising Rs 5.10 lakh crore in corporate tax and Rs 6.61 lakh crore in non-corporate tax.","Officials analysed data on substantial transactions since 2019-20, including purchases of gems, jewellery, property and luxury holidays paid in cash.

"ITR filing deadline: Don’t miss December 31, 2024 deadline for revised, belated tax returns",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/itr-filing-deadline-dont-miss-december-31-2024-deadline-for-revised-belated-tax-returns-here-are-the-consequences/articleshow/116495382.cms,"If one fails to submit a belated return by December 31, 2024, specific consequences apply.

ITR filing: What are the consequences of missing the belated return filing deadline on December 31, 2024?



ITR filing: What if you miss the revised return filing December 31, 2024 deadline?

ITR filing deadline : December 31, 2024, marks the final deadline for submitting belated and revised income tax returns for FY 2023-24 (AY 2024-25). Whilst various taxpayer categories have distinct ITR filing deadlines, the final date for belated and revised returns remains the same. Many individuals remain unaware of the implications of missing the December 31, 2024, submission deadline for FY 2023-24.If one fails to submit a belated return by December 31, 2024, specific consequences apply.Under Section 139(4) of the Income Tax Act, belated returns incur a Rs 5,000 penalty, regardless of outstanding tax amounts. A reduced penalty of Rs 1,000 applies for lower taxable income. However, individuals with income below the Rs 3 lakh basic exemption limit face no penalties.Kinjal Bhuta, Secretary of Bombay Chartered Accountants' Society, told ET, ""Belated return is the last chance for the taxpayer to file the ITR and claim refunds and certain losses. If the belated return is not filed, the person misses those claims and credits for that assessment year. After the expiry of the filing of the belated return, only an updated return can be filed subject to the condition that there is a tax liability payable. Further, if no belated return is filed, the taxpayer shall have to face increased interests and penalties on the tax liabilities if a notice is sent by the income tax department.""A significant limitation of filing belated returns for FY 2023-24 is the inability to select the old tax regime , as the new regime became default from April 1, 2023. Consequently, belated returns must follow the new tax regime .Also Read | Avoid Rs 10 lakh income tax penalty! Why it's important to report foreign income, assets in ITR by December 31, 2024 - check details The old tax regime offered various deductions and exemptions unavailable in the new tax regime. These provisions helped reduce taxable income and subsequent tax obligations.The new regime permits only two deductions: a standard deduction of Rs 50,000 for FY 2023-24 (AY 2024-25) and employer NPS contributions up to 10% of basic salary. Additional benefits like Section 80C, 80D, and HRA exemptions are not applicable under the new structure.When a taxpayer needs to rectify errors in original or belated returns, they must submit a revised return. This allows corrections of various oversights, such as unreported income, unclaimed deductions, or omitted bank account details.Bhuta says, ""If the taxpayer misses the deadline to file a revised return, there is no other mechanism to file a revised return again for that assessment year and to claim refunds or losses. The income tax laws allow the filing of an updated return. However, the updated return cannot be filed in cases where the taxpayer has losses, it results in an increased refund, or the tax return has an effect of reducing the total tax liability as filed in the original or belated return. There are many other criteria as to when an updated return cannot be filed. So, if a taxpayer misses the revised return deadline, the only way in which any additional claim or credit can be requested is during the assessment proceedings. However, that is subject to litigation.""Also Read | PAN 2.0: How to easily apply for PAN Card reprint with QR code - check 6 simple steps online Whilst taxpayers can submit multiple revised returns, tax experts advise against frequent revisions as this could trigger scrutiny from the Income Tax Department.Regarding intimation notices, Bhuta explains, ""As per section 139(5) of the Income Tax Act, 1961, ITR can be revised only before three months before the end of the relevant assessment year or before the completion of assessment, whichever event happens first. The ITR can be revised even after an intimation has been received under section 143(1). However, once the ITR is processed under a regular scrutiny assessment under section 143(3), the same cannot be revised.""For the financial year 2023-24 (AY 2024-25), taxpayers have until December 31, 2024, to submit their revised returns.","December 31, 2024, marks the final deadline for submitting belated and revised income tax returns for FY 2023-24 (AY 2024-25) If one fails to submit a belated return by December 31, 2016, specific consequences apply. The old tax regime offered various deductions and exemptions unavailable in the new tax regime.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116496929,imgsize-50318,width-400,resizemode-4/116496929.jpg"

Elon Musk-led Tesla has recommenced its search for showroom locations in New Delhi, according to two sources who spoke to Reuters, indicating a potential reconsideration of its Indian market entry after previously suspending investment plans this year.Following a temporary pause in its Indian showroom search, Tesla has now initiated preliminary discussions with DLF regarding space in the capital region, according to two sources with direct knowledge of the developments.According to one source, Tesla seeks 3,000 to 5,000 square feet for a customer experience centre, plus additional space triple that size for service and delivery operations.The company is considering various locations, including DLF's Avenue Mall in southern Delhi and the Cyber Hub complex in Gurugram.Earlier this year, Elon Musk indicated plans to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi and potentially announce a $2-3 billion investment in India.

There is no change in the tax rate of popcorn and the GST Council has only agreed that the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) will issue a circular clarifying the current taxation regime of popcorn.However, opposition politicians, economists and government supporters expressed their disapproval while others responded with humour and satire.""Complexity is a bureaucrat's delight and citizens' nightmare,"" said former Chief Economic Adviser K V Subramanian on X, questioning the decision's value given its minimal revenue impact and public inconvenience.Additionally, his predecessor Arvind Subramanian, criticised the move for increasing complexity rather than simplifying the system, mentioning issues with enforcement and rationality.Meanwhile, Congress party leader and spokesman Jairam Ramesh criticised the ""absurdity of three different tax slabs for popcorn under GST"", saying how it exemplifies the increasing complexity of what was intended to be a straightforward tax system.","GST Council proposed 5% GST for non-branded popcorn with salt and spices, 12% for pre-packaged and branded varieties, and 18% for caramel popcorn, classified under sugar confectionery.

And, nearly all of them are SUVs.India will make one of its strongest push towards EVs with almost all carmakers - ranging from late-to-enter Maruti Suzuki, close rival Hyundai, to luxury sellers Mercedes and Audi, to local heavyweights Mahindra and Tata Motors and Chinese giant BYD - driving in green cars. The launches will take place, despite growing doubts around mass adoption and an inadequate charging infrastructure.Elon Musk's Tesla may also tease the market with certain models through import route, as reports say the brand is scouting for retail locations here.With govt pushing hard for clean mobility, especially over concerns around pollution and growing fuel import bill, companies are set to respond with full force as they race against time to adhere to new fleet emission norms that stipulate heavy penalties for those polluting more than prescribed limits.

MUMBAI: C S Setty , who took over as SBI chairman in August 28, is positioning the country's largest bank as an entity focused on delivering quality service to customers by preparing the state-owned lender to harness technology. While upbeat on the economy, Setty tells TOI that the Budget should focus on pushing private sector capex .Excerpts:SBI is a 218-year-old institution, but we constantly reinvent ourselves to stay relevant. We began with rural financing, which remains a mainstay, but we have also expanded into corporate and retail banking. This showcases SBI's agility in adapting and readjusting to market dynamics. Over the last decade, we have embraced technology and digitalisation. Despite our extensive physical presence, we are now the largest digital bank in India.We are adding another SBI to ourselves every six years. Managing this scale requires more than just increasing headcount - it calls for a blend of manpower and technology. We are strengthening all our channels, including 'feet on the street'. A large number of employees are dedicated to home and auto loan procurement. In addition, we are actively recruiting; we will hire 13,000 clerical staff.Any slowdown we observed is seasonal, not structural. Govt spending was subdued in the last two quarters, but we anticipate resilience in the economy. Our house view is for approximately 6.5% growth.The segments impacted by RBI's measures have slowed down. However, SBI benefits from being a diversified bank. If one segment slows, we pivot to others. Sectors like MSME, and agriculture are performing well and remain vital to the economy.The Budget should focus on spurring economic activity and boosting private capital expenditure. Shortening the tenure of tax-free deposits would be helpful as long-term capital gains is available on shorter-term investments.Around 99% of our home loan borrowers are first-time homebuyers rather than speculative investors. This is reflected in our strong asset quality. We didn't see significant defaults, even during Covid. The market remains predominantly owner-occupied, with vast untapped potential.Gold loans are primarily used for short-term cash management by small businesses and SME customers, though some are for consumption purposes. We also have a significant agri-gold loan portfolio, which is very low-risk. We maintain visibility over how these loans are used and repaid, ensuring moderate loan-to-value ratios.Most credit card defaults, similar to microfinance institutions, occur in small-value loans. These borrowers are often new to credit and lack financial literacy. They sometimes borrow from multiple lenders. RBI's mandate for more frequent credit history updates will help address this issue. We already have access to borrowing information across lenders, and these updates will now be refreshed fortnightly instead of monthly.Yes, we have already implemented a business rule engine that is data- and cash-flow-driven. It uses GST data, account details, and sales figures to assess creditworthiness. Loans up to Rs 5 crore receive in-principle approval within 15 minutes. We plan to extend this facility to loans of up to Rs 50 crore as well.There is some pressure on liquidity, but RBI is supporting the system. We believe deposit rates have peaked, and most depositors are locking in at the current rates. We are looking beyond interest rates to mobilise deposits.Diversification of investment portfolios is a natural progression in a maturing economy. However, bank deposits remain essential. We aim to enhance customer stickiness by offering innovative products that combine recurring deposits, fixed deposits, and SIPs. Contrary to popular belief, we have a significant youth customer base, and our digital offerings are highly competitive.SBI has always been a major player in project financing in India. We possess the expertise to appraise large projects and remain a preferred lender in this space.","C S Setty, who took over as SBI chairman in August 28, is positioning the country's largest bank as an entity focused on delivering quality service to customers.

Car sales growth slowest in 4 years,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/car-sales-growth-slowest-in-4-years/articleshow/116867603.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: Car sales growth slowed down to around 5% in 2024, slowest pace of expansion in four years, highlighting the pressures companies are facing in urban markets.According to early estimates, the industry closed 2024 with sales of around 43 lakh units, against 41.1 lakh units in 2023, largely fuelled by SUVs that contributed 54% of the sales.While many companies say ""5% growth is still a positive for the industry, considering a high base"", some expect that pressure on companies is likely to continue in the new year. ""The industry now hopes for incentives in the budget, and feels that a cut in income tax rates - if it happens - will fuel consumption,"" a company executive said.Demand had been lacklustre through a significant part of 2024, with companies resorting to heavy price cuts and aggressive discounts to push sales, especially towards the year-end. With car prices going up significantly over the past few years due to statutory safety and emission requirements, there has been a decline in affordability of vehicles, which has also impacted demand.Despite pressure, Maruti Suzuki realised its highest-ever numbers in a year as it gained due to strong inroads into rural market. Partho Banerjee, senior executive officer (marketing & sales), told TOI that the company sold 17.9 lakh units in 2024, against 17.4 lakh units in previous year.""We have managed to realise growth across segments, and not just in SUVs where we now have a share of 27%,"" Banerjee said.Hyundai India had a near-flat year with 1% growth as it sold a shade over six lakh units. ""Hyundai has managed to sustain sales momentum in 2024, despite strong headwinds faced by the industry at large,"" Tarun Garg, director and COO at the company said.Tata Motors sold over 5.6 lakh units, with MD (PV and electric mobility) Shailesh Chandra crediting the demand to SUV sales . ""The PV industry posted moderate growth in 2024... with strong growth in SUV segment and sustained traction for emission-friendly powertrains. For Tata Motors, 2024 was the fourth consecutive year of highest-ever annual sales.

Xi Jinping: China’s 2024 GDP growth set to hit target of around 5%,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/xi-jinping-chinas-2024-gdp-growth-set-to-hit-target-of-around-5/articleshow/116835200.cms,"Xi signaled that support for the economy will continue into 2025.

Weak demand

Monetary easing

China’s gross domestic product is expected to expand around 5% for the full year of 2024, President Xi Jinping said, signaling the world’s second-largest economy is on track to meet its official target.China’s economy was “overall stable and progressing amid stability,” Xi said at a new year event on Tuesday, according to a speech published by the official Xinhua News Agency. Risks in key areas were effectively addressed, while employment and prices remained steady, he said.While a precise figure won’t be available until next month, the Chinese leader’s disclosure capped off a year of economic uncertainty, with the growth goal initially seen as a “target without a plan.” The outlook for 2024 improved after policymakers rolled out a slew of stimulus steps since late September, with economists now forecasting an expansion of 4.8% this year.Xi signaled that support for the economy will continue into 2025 during the New Year’s Eve remarks to the nation’s top political advisory body, reiterating a call to adopt more proactive macroeconomic policies.Later in the day in another new year address televised nationally, Xi acknowledged challenges facing China’s economy, including external uncertainties and shifting to new growth drivers, but called on the nation to remain confident in overcoming them.“In 2025, we will fully complete the 14th Five-Year Plan, implement more proactive and effective policies,” Xi said. “As always, we grow in wind and rain, and we get stronger through hard times. We must be full of confidence.”As in previous years, Xi also used his speech to reiterate the ruling Communist Party’s position on Taiwan. “No one can ever stop China’s reunification,” he said, alluding to Beijing’s longtime vow to bring the self-ruled island under its control, by force if necessary.China is expected to set a 2025 growth target roughly similar to this year’s, as top leaders signaled earlier this month they’re willing to embrace more forceful stimulus measures. That would help the economy counter any impact from potential increases in US tariffs after President-elect Donald Trump returns to the White House next month.An official GDP growth target would only be revealed in March, when annual legislative sessions are held. Chinese leaders plan to set an annual growth goal of about 5% for next year, Reuters reported earlier. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg estimate 4.5% growth in 2025.Officials at key meetings in December pledged to use greater public borrowing and spending as well as monetary easing to spur growth in 2025, in an unusually direct call that sought to boost confidence. They endorsed the first shift in monetary policy stance in 14 years to a “moderately loose” one.But the economy is still weighed by weak domestic demand and an uncertain outlook for exports, which has been a key growth driver this year. Deflation is likely to persist well into next year, while the property market is still slumping.Beijing’s initial stimulus next year is expected to fall short of the kind of radical action analysts believe is required to stem the downward spiral in prices, but officials may step up support later when growth falters just as they did this year.Previously, Premier Li Qiang also revealed the nation’s growth rate ahead of an official announcement by the statistics bureau in a step to lift sentiment. He said the economy grew 5.2% in 2023 in Davos last January, while highlighting the fact that China did not resort to massive stimulus.China’s next easing step could come from the People’s Bank of China, which has yet to provide a liquidity boost to markets by cutting the amount of cash banks must hold in reserves — a move it previously flagged as possible by the end of 2024.PBOC Governor Pan Gongsheng in October said the central bank may lower the reverse requirement ratio by 25 to 50 basis points depending on liquidity conditions by the year’s end. China’s top leaders at a key economic meeting in December also vowed to trim the RRR at an “appropriate time,” without providing more details.The PBOC’s decision likely took into consideration the need to stabilize the yuan. High-profile easing measures like a RRR cut could add to depreciation pressure on the yuan. That’s because it would worsen yuan assets’ yield disadvantage compared with dollar assets, triggering fund outflows. The yuan declined to its one-year low in December.The central bank likely withheld the RRR cut partly because the Federal Reserve signaled greater caution over how quickly it will lower interest rates, according to Bruce Pang, distinguished senior research fellow at the National Institution for Finance and Development, a think tank. The next window for a RRR cut could be after Trump takes office as US president on Jan. 20, he said.“The PBOC is preserving policy space to deal with increasing external uncertainties. Injecting too much liquidity could also make it harder to manage the yuan exchange rate and government bond yield,” he said.Liquidity in the interbank market remains ample for now, in spite of a seasonal rise in cash demand at the year-end period. The cost for top-rated commercial banks to raise funds from other institutions via one-year debt instruments hovered at the lowest since April 2020 at the end of December. Subdued loan demand may leave cash sitting idle in the banking system.PBOC is likely to lower the RRR in January before the Lunar New Year holiday — which begins Jan. 28 — if it doesn’t cut in December, according to analysts including Liu Yu at Huaxi Securities. Over the next year, the PBOC is expected to provide long-term liquidity by cutting the RRR and buying more government bonds.","China’s gross domestic product is expected to expand around 5% for the full year of 2024, President Xi Jinping said.

2024 becomes deadliest year in skies since 2018,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/2024-becomes-deadliest-year-in-skies-since-2018/articleshow/116809276.cms,"Commercial aviation has experienced its deadliest year since 2018 with 318 fatalities, including the Jeju Air disaster and the downing of an Azerbaijan Airlines plane. This reversal from 2023's record safety is marked by several tragic incidents, possibly exacerbated by global conflicts. Fatal aviation accidents, though rare, have surged this year.

Commercial aviation has suffered its deadliest year since 2018 after the Jeju Air disaster in South Korea and last week's downing of an Azerbaijan Airlines plane. Onboard passenger plane fatalities this year jumped to 318 with the two recent crashes, data compiled by Cirium shows. That's by far the highest death toll since more than 500 people died in 2018, a year marked by the first of two Boeing Co.737 Max crashes. It marks a reversal from 2023 - the safest year ever in aviation with no deaths among large passenger jetliners. Fatal aviation accidents remain very rare.In Jan, a Japan Airlines jet collided with a coastguard plane at Tokyo airport. Everyone aboard the jetliner survived, but five people on the smaller aircraft were killed. In July, Nepal's Saurya Airlines crashed after taking off, killing 18. And in Aug dramatic footage of a plane operated by Brazilian airline VoePass captured its freefalling from the sky after encountering icy weather conditions. That accident killed 62. Global conflicts may also have contributed to this year's fatalities. The Azerbaijan Airlines jet had nearly completed a scheduled flight from the capital city of Baku to Grozny, Russia, on Dec. 25 when it was suddenly diverted across the Caspian Sea in Kazakhstan. Azerbaijan's prez has said the plane was accidentally shot down by Russia.","Onboard passenger plane fatalities this year jumped to 318 with the two recent crashes, data compiled by Cirium shows.

Closure Of Bench Accounting: Bench Accounting Vancouver bookkeeping service shuts down,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/canada-based-bench-accounting-announces-sudden-closure-putting-hundreds-out-of-work/articleshow/116734374.cms,"Representative image

Former CEO speaks out

Competitors step in

Canada's Vancouver-based bookkeeping service Bench Accounting has announced its unexpected closure, leaving hundreds of employees without jobs and forcing thousands of customers to seek alternatives just days before the end of the year.In a statement posted on its website, Bench, which has described itself as North America's largest bookkeeping service for small businesses , revealed that as of Friday, the platform was ""no longer accessible."" The company acknowledged the abrupt nature of the closure, emphasizing that it would assist customers through the transition.As per CBC News, Bench had previously reported having over 600 employees and more than 12,000 US-based customers. The company had raised $113 million in investor funding. Initially founded as 10sheet Inc. in the US in 2012, Bench relocated to Vancouver and rebranded in 2013.With the unexpected shutdown, the company has outlined the steps its customers need to take to retrieve their data. They will be notified by December 30 and will be able to download their current and prior year-end financials, along with uploaded documents like receipts and bank statements, until March 7. Customers are advised to file for a tax extension to allow extra time to find a new bookkeeper to file their taxes.Calls to Bench’s Vancouver office went unanswered, with the line going directly to voicemail. In light of the closure, local officials expressed sympathy for the affected workers. British Columbia's minister of jobs, economic development, and innovation, Diana Gibson, extended her thoughts to those losing their jobs, especially during the holidays.She acknowledged that the province’s strong financial tech sector would continue to receive government support but noted that no further information about the reasons behind Bench's closure was available at this time, as reported by the Vancouver Sun.The closure has sparked a reaction from Bench’s former CEO and co-founder, Ian Crosby , who was ousted by the company's board three years ago. Crosby expressed his sadness over the company's fate and shared his perspective on the closure, which he sees as a cautionary tale for venture capitalists .“I hope the story of Bench goes on to become a warning for VCs (venture capitalists) that think they can ‘upgrade’ a company by replacing the founder. It never works,” Crosby said on social media.Crosby, a University of British Columbia Sauder Business School alumnus, recalled his battle with board members over their strategy for a “new direction” in 2021, which he believed would lead to the company’s downfall. He added that rather than continuing to fight, he chose to resign when he was replaced by a new leadership team.Kaz Nejatian, the COO of Shopify, which was an investor in Bench, also supported Crosby's view. ""Bad investors destroyed a great Canadian company by replacing the founder with so-called professionals,"" Nejatian wrote on social media, echoing Crosby's sentiments.As Bench’s sudden closure leaves many businesses scrambling for alternatives, rival bookkeeping companies such as Acuity and Better Bookkeeping have reached out to Bench's former clients, offering their services through social media campaigns.Some have even responded to complaints from former Bench customers, offering solutions for those affected by the disruption.The closure of Bench Accounting has left many small business owners grappling with the uncertainty of finding a new bookkeeping service, just as the year-end tax filing deadline approaches.","Vancouver-based bookkeeping service Bench Accounting has announced its unexpected closure.

Options expiry

MicroStrategy plan

A Bitcoin rally is fizzling in the final days of a record-breaking year for the digital asset, as investors assess the remaining impetus from President-elect Donald Trump’s embrace of the cryptocurrency sector.The largest token changed hands at $96,200 as of 6 am Friday in London, partly paring a retreat of almost 3 per cent from a day earlier. Smaller rivals including Ether and Dogecoin, a favorite of the meme crowd, oscillated in tight ranges.Trump is pushing ahead with a promise to create a crypto-friendly environment in the US and has backed the idea of establishing a national Bitcoin reserve. Traders are banking some of the profits sparked by the Republican’s crypto cheerleading and are waiting to see if the mooted reserve is feasible.The crypto market is also braced for the expiry of a substantial quantity of Bitcoin and Ether options contracts on Friday — one of the biggest such events in the history of digital assets, according to prime broker FalconX.The notional value of the Bitcoin contracts on the Deribit exchange — one of the largest for digital-asset derivatives — exceeds $14 billion, while the equivalent figure for Ether is about $3.8 billion.Sean McNulty, director of trading at liquidity provider Arbelos Markets, flagged the risk of a “choppy market” amid the expiry of the derivatives positions.Bitcoin is wavering even after MicroStrategy Inc. this week signaled the possibility of expanding its program of purchases of the token. The company has transformed itself from a software maker into a Bitcoin accumulator and now owns more than $40 billion of the digital asset.The original cryptocurrency is flirting with a drop for December, which would be its first monthly decline in four, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Bitcoin reached a record high of $108,316 on December 17 before pulling back.Investors withdrew a net $1.5 billion from a group of one dozen US spot-Bitcoin exchange-traded funds in the four trading days through December 24, the heaviest such outflow since Trump’s victory in the US election on November 5.","The largest token changed hands at $96,200 as of 6 am Friday in London, partly paring a retreat of almost 3 per cent from a day earlier.

Corporate highlights:

American Airlines Group Inc said a technical vendor glitch was the cause of a brief groundstop on all US flights on Christmas Eve, one of the busiest days of the holiday travel season.

Nippon Steel Corp’s proposed $12.3 billion acquisition of US Steel Corp. moved a step closer to being blocked after a US national security panel deadlocked on its review and left the final decision with President Biden, who has repeatedly indicated his opposition to the deal.

Salesforce Inc says it’s taking multiple large customers from former partner Veeva Systems Inc. in a mounting rivalry to sell software to the pharmaceutical industry.

A Starbucks Corp barista strike has shut down about 170 cafes, according to the coffee chain, disrupting service at locations nationwide during the final days of the crucial holiday shopping season.

A rally in the group that has led Wall Street ’s gains in 2024 lifted stocks in a relatively quiet session ahead of Christmas.Following a strong day for big tech, the shares continued to power ahead on Tuesday. Tesla Inc. led megacaps higher. Broadcom Inc. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. climbed as President Joe Biden’s team launched a probe into Chinese-made chips.In a shortened pre-holiday session, the S&P 500“The action of the past few weeks shows that the big-cap tech names are still the key leadership group in today’s stock market,” said Matt Maley at Miller Tabak. “These big-tech names are highly overweighted in the portfolios of a huge number of institutional investors. Any buying they do over the next week is likely to be concentrated in these names.”Equity investors are also hoping for what’s known as the “Santa Claus Rally,” in which stocks rise during the final five trading sessions of a year and the first two of the new one. This time around that window started Tuesday.“Santa Claus rally could still be alive, with strong seasonality into the end of the year,” said London Stockton at Ned Davis Research.Since 1950, the S&P 500 has generated average and median returns of 1.3% during this period, widely outpacing the market’s average seven-day gain of 0.3%, according to Adam Turnquist at LPL Financial.“When investors are on the ‘nice’ list, and Santa delivers a ‘positive’ Santa Claus Rallyreturn, the S&P 500 has generated an average January and forward annual return of 1.4% and 10.4%, respectively,” he said.The S&P 500 rose 1.1%. The Nasdaq 100 added 1.4%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.9%.The yield on 10-year Treasuries was little changed at 4.59%. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index barely budged.While a positive “Santa Claus Rally” has preceded a 10.4% average annual gain for the S&P 500 since World War II, Sam Stovall at CFRA says a more accurate indicator in his view is the “January Barometer.”That’s a market hypothesis positing that January’s performance predicts the year’s performance. The term was coined by Yale Hirsch, creator of the Stock Trader’s Almanac, in 1972.Since 1945, when the year started with a gain in January, the S&P 500 rose an average of 18.3% in price during the entire year, Stovall at CFRA said. If the first month saw a decline in price, however, the average full-year return was negative 1.9%.With the market up over 25% this year and no corrections of more than 10%, the S&P 500 has managed to stay solidly above its 200-day moving average for the entirety of 2024, noted Bespoke Investment Group strategists.“Barring a significant market selloff in the last few trading days of the year, this will be the 12th year since 1952 (when we went to the current 5-day trading week at the NYSE) that the S&P has traded above its 200-DMA all year,” they said.The average next-year change following these years has been a gain of just 4.6% compared to the average gain of 9.2% for all years, Bespoke noted.Last week, Bank of America Corp. clients were large net buyers of US equities, according to strategist Jill Carey Hall. They bought American shares for the seventh consecutive week.Similar to the prior five weeks, clients bought both single stocks and exchange-traded funds, with bigger inflows into the former, she noted. Flows were primarily in large caps.Investors should have a more-balanced approach in US stocks over the first quarter, according to Citigroup Inc. strategists led by Scott Chronert, who see a greater opportunity in defensive sectors.They raised health care to overweight, noting valuations are now lower and fundamentals seem close to inflection point. Meantime, they are selective on growth stocks, looking for stronger fundamental trend versus valuation and potential margin improvement.Citi’s strategists are overweight in media, internet and semiconductors, while raising software to market weight.",The S&P 500 rose 1.1%.

The battle of the top performing L1 blockchains has been pretty wild this year, with the likes of ETH, SOL, TRX, BNB, Toncoin (TON) and Cardano (ADA) fighting to claim the leadership mantle. However, out of all these networks, TON blockchain is showing huge promise as it records approximately 200% gains.Conversely, Cardano network is also making waves, especially as its new Hydra scalability solution is set to potentially unlock 1 million TPS. On the other hand, predictions about a fast-rising presale star– Lunex Network (LNEX) are blowing up as it shows the potential of overthrowing TON and ADA in 2025.Over the past year and counting, TON blockchain has been widely popular for one major thing— blockchain lucrative games. The partnership between Toncoin and Telegram to bring mini-games to millions of users was a very profitable one.From launching several tap-to-earn games to furthering its expansion in P2E games, Toncoin has been able to rack up approximately 200% NET gains . As experts rank Toncoin (TON) alongside cryptos to buy , analysts are starting to give bullish predictions.Although TON price is currently down by 11% as it trades within a weekly range of $6.6 and $5.9, the network is still receiving positive sentiment. X aanalyst, Crypto King particularly sighted a short term prediction of $10 for Toncoin. While this may seem far-fetched from the current price, the token’s 50, 100, and 200 moving averages points at a strong buy.Since its founder, Charles Hoskinson met up with President Donald Trump for the sake of enhancing crypto adoption, Cardano has been buzzing alongside otherDeFi coins . Cardano price now sits at a weekly range of $$0.98 and $1.28, 70% jump from its price in the past month. However experts believe this is just the starting.During a recent Cardano market dip, whales took the opportunity to accumulate 130 million ADA token, signaling huge bullish sentiment and strong confidence. Owing to this several investors are positive for Cardano network.Ali Martinez, a seasoned crypto analyst and expert has sparked more optimism recently. In a very recent tweet. Ali emphasized on how he will keep buying ADA even if it dips to $0.7 as he expects a further surge to $4 or $6 for Cardano.As a fast, secure and non-custodial DeFi project with robust features to facilitate effortless cross chain transactions, it won’t be surprising for Lunex Network (LNEX) to challenge top DeFi coins. The new altcoin project has already accumulated over $5.4 million in revenue after selling over 2.3 billion of its presale supply. Such buying interest only speaks of its potential to deliver immeasurable returns when it launches on DEX platforms.However, asides the numbers, Lunex Network has more growth potential embedded in its ecosystem and practical use. For starters, the platform allows investors to swap up to 50,000 cryptocurrencies across multi chains by connecting isolated blockchains together. Additionally, users can invest in its LNEX tokens and earn up to 18% APY in passive income when they engage in its staking pool.Furthermore, there’s a reward system where the platform gives half of its revenue to users while preserving the other half for more exclusive rewards. Alongside this, Lunex Network helps investors track their portfolio while delivering updated market insights. The platform also grants cashback rewards on every transaction, allowing users to earn more by actively using the network. With over 300% spike, its LNEX token is now valued at $0.0048 from an initial $0.0012.The practical uses and diversity that Lunex Network brings as an exchange platform is enough to contend with the likes of Toncoin. Although TON has seen huge developments as a mothering network to several other cryptocurrencies, Lunex Network’s intricate design catered for crypto investors, business owners and Web3 development makes it stand out as a tough contender. This put LNEX token on the radar of top cryptos to buy.You can find more information about Lunex Network (LNEX) here:Website: https://lunexnetwork.com Socials: https://linktr.ee/lunexnetwork","Lunex Network (LNEX) is primed for a staggering growth above most DeFi coins.

They plans to finalise a merger agreement by June and complete the transaction, including listing the holding company on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, by August 2026.Japanese automotive manufacturers have fallen behind major competitors in electric vehicle development and are seeking cost reductions while attempting to recover lost ground.Earlier this month, speculation emerged about potential collaboration, with unconfirmed reports suggesting that discussions were partially influenced by Taiwan's Foxconn's interest in acquiring Renault SA's Nissan shares.Meanwhile, Nissan's chief executive Makoto Uchida confirmed no direct communication from Foxconn, while acknowledging Nissan's ""severe"" circumstances.However, even after merger, Toyota will remain Japan's dominant automotive manufacturer, having produced 11.5 million vehicles in 2023. The three combining companies would collectively manufacture approximately 8 million vehicles. During 2023, Honda manufactured 4 million units, Nissan 3.4 million, and Mitsubishi Motors made just over 1 million.Earlier in August, Nissan, Honda and Mitsubishi announced their intention to join hands on electric vehicle components and autonomous driving software research, following an initial agreement between Nissan and Honda in March.Sam Fiorani, vice president of AutoForecast Solutions said that Honda could benefit from Nissan's truck-based SUVs like the Armada and Infiniti QX80, while gaining from Nissan's expertise in battery technology, electric vehicles and hybrid powertrains.Earlier, Nissan announced layoffs affecting 9,000 staff globally in November, alongside a 20% reduction in production capacity, after reporting losses of 9.3 billion yen. CEO Makoto Uchida accepted a 50% salary reduction while implementing efficiency improvements.","Japanese car manufacturers Honda and Nissan on Monday announced their plans to work towards a merger. The two automaker signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) on Monday, with Nissan's smaller alliance partner Mitsubishi Motors also agreeing to participate in discussions about business integration. The combined entity could be valued above $50 billion, based on the market worth of all three manufacturers.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116598766,imgsize-369282,width-400,resizemode-4/116598766.jpg"

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume.While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume.

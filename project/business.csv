Rupee opened in green on Friday, climbing 9 paise to 90.25 against the US dollar, as currency markets reacted to optimism around the India-US trade deal but remained cautious ahead of the Reserve Bank of India’s monetary policy announcement.The early gains came after the currency ended Thursday’s session higher by 13 paise at 90.34 against the greenback. According to forex traders, while sentiment has improved, rupee’s movement continues to be constrained by strong corporate demand for dollars and weakness in domestic equities. Market participants are also said to be shifting from initial optimism to scrutiny, as neither India nor the US has released formal documents outlining the agreement.On Thursday, rupee opened at 90.52 in the interbank foreign exchange market, moved to an intraday high of 90.06 and a low of 90.53, before settling at 90.34, marking a gain of 13 paise over the previous close.Attention is also on the Reserve Bank of India, where the six-member Monetary Policy Committee led by Governor Sanjay Malhotra began deliberations on Wednesday. The policy decision will be announced on Friday morning.Experts said the RBI has already cut the repo rate by 125 basis points since last February and may maintain a pause, although some believe another rate cut remains possible to further lower borrowing costs.Meanwhile on the stock market front, equity benchmarks opened on a subdued note on Friday, slipping into negative territory as investors adopted a wait-and-watch approach ahead of MPC decision.At the opening bell, the Nifty 50 fell 37 points, or 0.14%, to 25,605.80, while the BSE Sensex edged down 64.61 points, or 0.08%, to 83,249.32.

Stock market today: Nifty50 and BSE Sensex , the Indian equity benchmark indices, opened in red ahead of the RBI monetary policy. While Nifty50 opened below 25,600, BSE Sensex was down almost 300 points. At 10:05 AM, Nifty50 was trading at 25,535.55, down 107 points or 0.42%. BSE Sensex was at 83,043.21, down 270 points or 0.32%.Indian equity markets moved within a narrow band on Thursday, reflecting investor caution amid the absence of fresh domestic triggers. Market participants largely adopted a wait-and-watch approach, with analysts noting that benchmark indices continued to consolidate without establishing a clear directional trend.Analysts said the Nifty remained confined to a tight range, as repeated attempts to sustain gains or extend declines failed to hold, indicating ongoing consolidation in the market.Dr. VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Investments Limited says, “There is a risk-off sentiment in global markets. Bitcoin has crashed to below $ 64000. Silver is down to $71 from the recent peak of 121. Even the safe-haven gold has turned weak despite huge uncertainty in global geopolitics.The tech-heavy Nasdaq has been steadily weakening and is now 6% down from its peak. The selloff in tech and AI stocks and a departure from AI trade would be good for India in the medium-term, but for that further weakening of the AI trade is required. So, watch out for the trend in AI stocks.FIIs again turning sellers in India and increasing their short positions in the derivative markets indicates further weakness in the market in the near-term.”“A positive trigger for the market in the form of rate cut from the MPC is unlikely today since the MPC is expected to hold rates. Any change in the stance also is unlikely. However the tone of the policy can be dovish and the Central Bank may revise the growth targets for FY27 upwards improving sentiments.""Global market cues were weak, adding to the cautious sentiment. S&P 500 futures declined 0.9 percent as of 9:12 a.m. Tokyo time. Hang Seng futures slipped 1.4 percent, while Japan’s Topix index fell 1 percent. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 dropped 1.6 percent, and Euro Stoxx 50 futures were down 1.1 percent.Foreign portfolio investors were net sellers in the equity market, offloading shares worth Rs 2,150 crore on Thursday.

$2 trillion wiped off crypto markets! Bitcoin halves since October; investor company shares sink to multiyear lows,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/2-trillion-wiped-off-crypto-markets-bitcoin-halves-since-october-investor-company-shares-sink-to-multiyear-lows/articleshow/127966672.cms,"Strategy shares plunge to multi-year lows

Bitcoin wipes out gains since Trump’s election

Broader digital asset holdings also hit

Fed concerns and investor outflows

Tech sector weakness piles pressure on crypto segment

Cryptogiant Bitcoin has suffered sharp losses since the beginning of 2026, tumbling over 20%. The digital currency has given up almost half of its value since October’s record peak of over $124,000, sliding to $67,000, now worth less than it was at the start of President Donald Trump’s second term. Bitcoin is often pitched as “digital gold” as its returns are just like gold, offering no dividends or profits and price driven by what investors are willing to pay. The world’s largest cryptocurrency was last trading 1.64% higher at $64,153.24 after a volatile session that saw prices swing between gains and losses, having earlier touched a low of $60,008.52.The global crypto market has lost $2 trillion in value since peaking at $4.379 trillion in early October, with $800 billion wiped out in the last month alone, Reuters reported. Bitcoin has declined 28% so far this year, while ether has lost nearly 38% over the same period.As the asset slid, shares of companies holding bitcoin and other digital assets also came under heavy pressure amid ongoing turbulence in the cryptocurrency market, fuelling concerns about stress across the sector. Publicly listed firms that piled into crypto last year, encouraged by US President Donald Trump’s supportive stance, are now grappling with intensifying market challenges.The decline comes as uncertainty over Federal Reserve rate cuts and concerns over AI company valuations weigh on risk assets, pushing bitcoin to its lowest level since November 2024.MicroStrategy’s bitcoin-focused arm, Strategy, has seen shares tumble from $457 in July to $111.27 on Thursday, marking their lowest level since August 2024. The stock was last down more than 11%, according to Reuters.In December, Strategy cut its 2025 earnings forecast, citing weak bitcoin performance, and announced plans to create a reserve to support dividend payments. The company now expects full-year earnings between a $6.3 billion profit and a $5.5 billion loss, down from its earlier forecast of $24 billion.Other notable bitcoin buyers have also been hit. UK-based Smarter Web Company (SWC.L) fell nearly 18%, Nakamoto Inc (NAKA.O) lost almost 9%, and Japan’s Metaplanet (3350.T) dropped over 7%.Bitcoin itself is down nearly 28% since the start of the year, with recent selling accelerating after Trump nominated Kevin Warsh as the next Federal Reserve chair. Analysts cited by Reuters say that Warsh’s appointment could lead to a smaller Fed balance sheet, a negative for speculative assets like crypto.Bitcoin has erased all gains made since Trump’s election, when he pledged to overhaul policies toward digital assets. The cryptocurrency last traded at $67,651.“As Bitcoin continues its slide below the psychological barrier of $70,000, it’s clear the crypto market is now in full capitulation mode,"" said Nic Puckrin, investment analyst and co-founder of Coin Bureau. ""If previous cycles are anything to go by, this is no longer a short-term correction, but rather a transition... and these typically take months, not weeks,"" Reuters cited the expert.Companies holding other tokens have been affected as well. Alt5 Sigma, which stocks the Trump family’s WLFI token, fell 8.4%. SharpLink Gaming, holding ether, dropped 8%, while Forward Industries, which holds solana, fell nearly 6%.Bitcoin fell to a low of $63,295.74 on Thursday, its weakest since October 2024, before rebounding slightly to $63,525, marking its largest one-day drop since November 2022. Approximately $1 billion in bitcoin positions were liquidated over 24 hours, according to CoinGlass data.Trump’s Fed pick, Kevin Warsh, has added to market fears. Analysts say investors worry that a smaller balance sheet will remove liquidity support for speculative assets.""The market fears a hawk with him,"" Manuel Villegas Franceschi from Julius Baer told Reuters. ""A smaller balance sheet is not going to provide any tailwinds for crypto.""Deutsche Bank analysts highlighted massive outflows from institutional ETFs as a key driver of the decline.US spot bitcoin ETFs saw over $3 billion withdrawn in January, following $2 billion and $7 billion outflows in December and November, respectively. ""This steady selling in our view signals that traditional investors are losing interest, and overall pessimism about crypto is growing,"" they said.The slide in cryptocurrencies has been compounded by a broader downturn in tech stocks, particularly software companies linked to AI. Bitcoin and other tokens have historically tracked risk appetite in technology markets, and the current weakness has intensified losses.""Concerns are being raised around the crypto miners and whether we could be looking at forced liquidations if prices continue to fall, which could lead to a vicious cycle,"" said Jefferies strategist Mohit Kumar, as cited by Reuters. The analyst further added that crypto “should never be more than a very small portion of a portfolio, but its heavy retail ownership adds to overall market risk.""","Global crypto market has lost $2 trillion in value since peaking at $4.379 trillion in early October, with $800 billion wiped out in the last month alone.

Gold and silver price prediction: Gold and silver prices have resumed their upward momentum after the recent crash, signalling bullish momentum, says Abhilash Koikkara, Head - Forex & Commodities, Nuvama Professional Clients Group. He shares his views on gold and silver:MCX Gold on the weekly timeframe has undergone a correction from its all-time high of 180,779. However, prices have found support at the rising trendline and have rebounded, indicating a resumption of the bullish trend. The recent acceleration reinforces the strength and sustainability of the move, and the broader outlook remains positive as long as prices hold above the weekly low.From a weekly standpoint, the 147,000 region stands out as a crucial support, aligned with the 30-days exponential moving average. Any pullback toward this zone is expected to draw fresh buying interest, helping to limit downside risk in the near term. Sustaining above this level keeps the bullish structure intact and supports ongoing positive momentum.Gold looks well positioned to move toward the 175,000 mark in the coming sessions, and a decisive close above this level would validate the bullish bias for subsequent periods.This potential upside aligns with the broader uptrend and highlights the strength of prevailing momentum. Moreover, the formation of higher highs and higher lows over the week further supports positive sentiment and points to the likelihood of a sustained upward move.Overall, gold continues to exhibit a positive bias, with the broader technical structure clearly supporting trend continuation. As long as prices stay comfortably above the key 147,000 support level, the bullish setup remains valid. Backed by strong momentum indicators and a supportive market sentiment environment, the metal appears well placed to carry its upward move forward in the coming sessions.MCX Silver has seen a healthy pullback from its all-time high of 420,048 and has since rebounded from recent lows, signalling a resumption of the bullish trend. With the underlying trend still positive, any ongoing dips may be viewed as buying opportunities as long as the latest weekly low holds. We advise aligning positions with the prevailing uptrend, while maintaining a controlled stop-loss at the recent weekly lows.Silver’s rally at the start of the week signals a renewed bullish trend and strengthens the outlook for further upside. As long as prices remain above the weekly support levels, the positive bias is expected to persist. Immediate key support is seen around the 245,000 zone, and a close below this level could weaken the bullish outlook. Until then, any pullback is likely to attract fresh buying interest, sustaining upward momentum.On the upside, silver appears well positioned to test the 330,000 resistance over the near to medium term. This prospective move points to a continuation of the prevailing bullish phase, backed by strong momentum and favourable technical indicators. Overall, provided prices remain firmly above the 245,000 support level, silver is expected to sustain its uptrend, with ample scope for further appreciation as bullish sentiment continues to strengthen.","Gold and silver prices have resumed their upward momentum after the recent crash, says Abhilash Koikkara, Head - Forex & Commodities, Nuvama Professional Clients Group.

Nifty has been on a roller coaster from the start of this calendar month with India VIX seeing over 80% gain in volatility from January 01, 2026. With large gap up opening unable to sustain, the gap between last week highs and this week’s low is likely to get filled sooner this month. This gap however, should be used to create longs with support seen at the rising 200 DMA for targets of 25940 / 26100.Bank Nifty has already done what we are expecting Nifty to do, which is it has tested its last week’s highs in yesterday’s volatile session. Breaking of current week’s low and reversing near 59700 odd is likely to be used as an opportunity to create fresh longs on the index, as Bank Nifty has experienced 59650 as significant resistance over the past 9 weeks of trade and the same is likely to act as support based on classical technical thesis.After its initial breakout from 15 month sloping trendline, PETRONET had been lacking triggers making it wait within a 6-8% band. With the 200 DMA now supportively reclaimed and stock closing at 6 month highs, momentum buyers could come in. Given the set up an 8-10% rally can unfold.MRPL has recovered over 30% in the last 9 trading sessions given its reversal from the 200 DMA support. A repetitive higher low formation was also seen on weekly charts of the same.Stock is on the verge of closing at 16 month highs on weekly charts if it retains at CMP until Friday’s close which also corresponds to an end to the stock’s 2 year corrective phase.CCL had been consolidating for the past 12 weeks with a negative bias correcting over 15% from its all time highs. With lower high formations seen from the start of this calendar year and a trendline breakout of this consolidation seen this week, prices indicate a start of a fresh up move unfolding back to its previous highs.","Aakash K Hindocha, Deputy Vice President - WM Research, Nuvama Professional Clients Group, the top buy calls for today are: PETRONET, MRPL, and CCL.

Bangladesh set for ‘secret’ US tariff deal ahead of elections — move after India’s pact?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/bangladesh-set-for-secret-us-tariff-deal-ahead-of-elections-move-after-indias-pact/articleshow/127966701.cms,"India-US Trade Deal: US Tariff Cut Puts India Ahead Of China, Pakistan, Bangladesh In Trade Race

Bangladesh's interim government plans to sign a secret tariff agreement with the United States on February 9, just three days before the country's parliamentary elections and about a week after India secured a trade with the US. The move has sparked concerns among business leaders and analysts due to its timing and lack of transparency, as the contents remain confidential under a non-disclosure agreement signed between the two nations.Concerns have been raised over plans to sign the agreement in the final days of the government’s tenure, primarily because details of the draft remain undisclosed, as reported by Bangladesh Daily Prothom Alo. Bangladesh has already signed a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) with the US, keeping all aspects of the proposed deal confidential.Thus, if the agreement is signed on February 9, it will come just days before the interim government’s term is set to end, with voting for the 13th parliamentary election.The timing also means, it will be signed a week after US president Donald Trump announced it's trade deal with India, leading to tariff reduction to 18 per cent.Details of the newly announced India–US trade agreement are expected to become clearer in the coming days, with Union commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal confirming that the first tranche of the bilateral pact is ready. A joint statement is likely within the next four to five days, after which the United States is expected to issue an executive order reducing tariffs to 18 per cent. The formal legal agreement is expected to be signed around mid-March.Read more: India-US trade deal - Joint statement in next 4–5 days; agreement likely by mid-March, says Piyush Goyal The business leaders are worried about potential negative impacts on various sectors and question why such a significant decision is being made by a temporary government.BGMEA senior vice president Inamul Haque Khan expressed surprise at the timing, saying, ""I still believe this should have been done after the election, because it carries major implications."" “Based on the target for purchases from the US, it can be expected that the reciprocal tariff rate will come down to 15 per cent (currently 20 per cent). I had heard that national security adviser Khalilur Rahman had streamlined this. I was surprised to see the signing of the agreement come just three days before the election. I still believe this should have been done after the election, because it carries major implications,” he added.Similarly, DCCI president Taskeen Ahmed added that the interim government could have avoided this rushed decision.The negotiations and concerns linger from April 2025, when US President Donald Trump announced reciprocal tariffs on 100 countries, initially setting Bangladesh's rate at 37 per cent. Through negotiations, this was eventually reduced to 20 per cent in August last year.The US included various conditions in the agreement. These include requiring Bangladesh to reduce Chinese imports, increase American military equipment purchases, and accept US standards without additional inspections. The deal also aims to boost US agricultural exports to Bangladesh and ease access for American automobiles.Commerce secretary Mahbubur Rahman confirmed the signing date and but will not travel to Washington in-person. Instead, a five-member delegation from Bangladesh will travel to Washington for the event, according to a Bangladesh government order (GO) issued by their ministry of commerce on February 3.The delegation will be led by Khadija Nazneen, Additional Secretary at the Ministry of Commerce and head of the World Trade Organization (WTO) Wing. The other members are Joint Secretaries Firoz Uddin Ahmed and Mustafizur Rahman, Senior Assistant Secretary Sheikh Shamsul Arefin, and National Board of Revenue (NBR) Commissioner Rais Uddin Khan. As per the GO, the delegation is scheduled to leave Dhaka on Friday, February 6, and return on or around February 10.The interim government has recently made other significant long-term decisions, including port management agreements with international companies. CPD distinguished fellow Debapriya Bhattacharya criticized the lack of transparency, stating, ""This is not just a tariff agreement with the US but one with long-term implications. It must be viewed holistically, including its geopolitical and political dimensions. ""Critics argue that while keeping such agreements confidential is common practice, they are typically signed by elected governments accountable to parliament and citizens. The rushed timing and secretive nature of the agreement have led to speculation about whether it unnecessarily constrains the incoming elected government's options.","Bangladesh's interim government plans to sign a secret tariff agreement with the United States on February 9.

Maximising returns

MUMBAI: Life Insurance Corporation will soon take measures to increase the yield on its real estate assets, which have a book value of Rs 16,000 crore post-revaluation and a market value of over Rs 45,000 crore. Officials said that while real estate typically yields 3-4%, the capital gains are much higher. The corporation has also shelved plans to acquire a strategic stake in a health insurance company.Addressing a press conference after the board meeting, the corporation’s MD & CEO R Doraiswamy said LIC has decided to go slow on its earlier announced plan of entering the health insurance business, which was announced by his predecessor.“There was a plan to enter as a strategic investor in a standalone health insurance company to understand the market. But while evaluating options, we find it is not immediately required. So we are not moving fast. As and when we find a suitable opportunity, we will look at it,” he said.Officials said LIC is reviewing its entire real estate portfolio to identify ways to enhance yields. It indicated that selling properties is not the immediate priority and the focus is on strengthening income generation from the assets.Officials said the insurer is also open to examining new structures, including options such as Reit-like models, although no decision has been taken yet.In her Budget speech, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said that the govt would accelerate recycling of significant real estate assets of central public sector enterprises through the setting up of dedicated Reits.For the quarter ended Dec 2025, the corporation reported standalone net profit of Rs 12,958 crore, up 17.2% from Rs 11,056 crore in the corresponding year-ago period.Profit before tax rose 16.7% to Rs 12,897 crore from Rs 11,056 crore, according to the insurer’s reviewed standalone financial results. Net premium income rose 17.5% to Rs 1,25,613 crore from Rs 1,06,891 crore, supported by growth in new business and single premium products.The corporation has not yet taken a call on selling stake in NSE, where it is a major shareholder, in the forthcoming IPO.","Life Insurance Corporation will soon take measures to increase the yield on its real estate assets.

"Stocks, metals bleed on weak economic data",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/stocks-metals-bleed-on-weak-economic-data/articleshow/127953685.cms,"File photo

MUMBAI: A series of disappointing economic data from around the world, along with Anthropic’s launch of a new AI-tool that could threaten established businesses of several software services companies across the world, have pushed most of the leading global equity indices into the red zone. Ongoing geopolitical uncertainties are also adding to investors’ anxiety. And in the commodities space, a stronger dollar is leading to heavy sell-off across the metals space.Consider this: On Thursday, across Asia, the Nikkei index in Japan closed 0.9% lower while the Shanghai Composite in China and sensex in India each closed 0.6% lower. In Europe in late trades, FTSE in the UK was down 0.8% while Dax in Germany was down 1%. In early trades in the US, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite was down 1.6%, Dow Jones index was down 1.1% and S& was down 1.2%. Brazil was the lone bright spot among a sea of red: In early trades the iBovespa index was up 0.5%.In the metals space, in mid-session on the New York Commodity Exchange, silver was down 13%, gold 2.4% and copper 1.4%.Globally, the unemployment rate is raising its head in developed economies that in turn is pushing some of the central bankers and policymakers to rethink their economic policies, a leading debt fund manager said.This is also making investors jittery, he added.

MUMBAI: Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles (TMPV) slipped into a loss in the third quarter, hit by a cyberattack at its UK luxury arm, Jaguar Land Rover (JLR), which disrupted operations and triggered a one-time charge of Rs 1,600 crore. The company reported a consolidated loss of Rs 3,483 crore during the October-December period, compared with a profit of Rs 5,485 crore a year earlier.JLR, which contributes nearly 80% of TMPV’s revenue, was forced to halt production for five weeks until early Oct following the cyberattack. The incident resulted in loss of $228.5 million in July-Sept and prompted the UK govt to step in with a loan guarantee of $2.04 billion to support the luxury carmaker's supply chain.During Q3FY26, TMPV’s revenue declined nearly 26% to Rs 69,605 crore. JLR’s revenue fell about 34% to Rs 53,849 crore, while non-JLR revenue, including the India passenger vehicle business, rose 24% to Rs 15,317 crore. JLR’s earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) margin deteriorated to negative 6.8%, compared with a positive 9% a year earlier.Management expects a significant improvement in JLR’s performance in Q4FY26, despite continued volatility in the external environment.","Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles (TMPV) slipped into a loss in the third quarter, hit by a cyberattack at its UK luxury arm, Jaguar Land Rover.

AI erodes software moats

BENGALURU: A sharp selloff in global software stocks over the past month has reignited a basic question for founders, investors and customers alike: what happens to the economics of software-as-a-service when AI makes building and maintaining software dramatically cheaper?Advances in GenAI, autonomous agents and AI-assisted coding are forcing a rethink of long-held assumptions about SaaS defensibility, pricing power and growth. Tasks that once required large engineering teams can now be executed faster and at far lower costs, raising concerns that many software products may become easier to replicate and much harder to monetise.The growing unease has spilled into public markets. According to tech publication The Register, Adobe, Microsoft, Salesforce, SAP, ServiceNow and Oracle have together shed more than $730 billion in market value over the past month as of Tuesday’s close, as investors reassess how AI could reshape the software profit pool.On Wall Street trading desks, the selloff has acquired a name. Jeffrey Favuzza of Jefferies described the rout as a “SaaSpocalypse” in comments to Bloomberg, saying, “We call it the ‘SaaSpocalypse,’ an apocalypse for software-as-a-service stocks.”Behind the market volatility lies a deeper industry debate. Zoho founder and CEO Sridhar Vembu has argued that SaaS was structurally vulnerable even before the current AI wave.In a widely shared post, Vembu said the sector had leaned too heavily on sales-led growth and expanding budgets, calling AI “the pin that is popping this inflated balloon.”Others argue that the impact will be uneven rather than existential. Srikanth Velamakanni, co-founder and CEO of Fractal Analytics, said AI is compressing software value but not eliminating it. “It is vastly easier to build software today than ever before,” he said.“You can write 10,000 lines of code a day per person when the industry average used to be about 10. That means large parts of existing SaaS codebases can be abstracted away very quickly. What does not change overnight is distribution, trust and deep integration into enterprise workflows. Those factors give software companies durability, even as pricing pressure increases,” he added.Manav Garg, founder of Together Fund, said AI’s impact will differ for different categories of services.","AI-assisted coding is forcing a rethink of long-held assumptions about SaaS defensibility, pricing power and growth.

Timely boost: Govt expands scope of startup recognition,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/timely-boost-govt-expands-scope-of-startup-recognition/articleshow/127953446.cms,"Generative image

MUMBAI: In a boost to the startup ecosystem, govt has widened the scope of recognition of startups, extending the benefit to companies with a turnover of Rs 200 crore from Rs 100 crore earlier. This means that startups generating a turnover of up to Rs 200 crore will now get recognised, expanding the coverage of firms. This has been done to ensure support for startups in different stages of their businesses, the govt said on Thursday.Besides, a new sub-category of deep tech startup has been introduced covering entities working on cutting-edge and breakthrough technologies. The eligibility criteria for such startups has also been broadened with the age limit extended from 10 years to 20 years from the date of incorporation or registration, and the turnover limit increased to Rs 300 crore.“As Startup India enters its second decade, the revised framework seeks to provide a more predictable, inclusive and future-ready policy environment for founders, while facilitating the flow of long-term patient capital into high-technology and research-intensive sectors,” the govt said.The govt has also included cooperative societies as eligible entities to enable innovation in agriculture, rural industries and community-based enterprises. The updated criteria is expected to expand access to startup benefits for research- and innovation-driven enterprises, provide targeted support to deep tech ventures and enable cooperatives to drive innovation in agriculture and rural development, strengthening India’s position as a global hub for high-technology and knowledge-intensive entrepreneurship, govt said.India has the third-largest startup ecosystem in the world after US and China.

Small base, rapid rise

MUMBAI: India’s high-net worth individuals (HNIs) and rich family offices are increasingly betting on private credit deals in search for higher, predictable returns. Investing in the space, which grew to a nearly $13 billion market locally in 2025 also allows them to diversify their portfolio.“Regulatory and tax changes have made debt mutual funds less attractive while Sebi regulated alternative investment fund (AIF) structures provide comfort and scale to investors,” said Nilesh Dhedhi, MD & CEO at Avendus Finance.Private credit essentially is debt financing provided by non-bank lenders to largely mid-market companies. Large family offices globally and in India have 15%-25% of their portfolios in alternative investments of which 25%-30% goes into private credit solutions, S&P Global said in a note last year.Most private credit platforms in India are structured as category II AIF entities, governed by Sebi. “In an environment where public equity can be volatile, and bond yields may not fully compensate for inflation and credit risk, private credit offers visibility, security and yield. Additionally, many HNIs appreciate the ability to invest in with tangible assets and strong covenants backing their capital,” said Prakash Bulusu, joint CEO at IIFL Capital.What’s fueling the rise of private credit in the first place is the fact that banks are not being able to fulfil all kinds of requirements, leaving a funding gap for mid-market structured credit, said Dhedhi. “Private credit can provide non-dilutive capital that can be tailored to specific needs of each borrower.There are multiple end-uses for which companies across the spectrum raise private credit added Amit Dharod, MD, alternative assets at JM Financial AMC. Private credit instruments grew between 40%-50% in 2025 over the previous year, said Dharod. While foreign capital helped start the momentum, the real push has come from domestic investors including HNIs and family offices, said asset managers. Vivriti Asset Management has made 10 investments across sectors in the past 7-8 months, said chief investment officer Soumendra Ghosh.The pipeline for private credit in India looks robust this year, especially in the Rs 100-1,000 crore ticket size segment, said Bulusu. “We are seeing dozens of active mandates at any given point, with aggregate deal activity running into several tens of thousands of crores annually,” said Bulusu, adding that activity is high in manufacturing, renewables, real estate, logistics, financial services, healthcare sectors alongside select technology-led businesses.","India’s high-net worth individuals (HNIs) and rich family offices are increasingly betting on private credit deals.

The figure also came in below economists’ expectations. Layoffs edged higher during the period, while the number of people voluntarily quitting jobs — an indicator of worker confidence — remained broadly unchanged at 3.2 million.The data highlights a widening gap between economic expansion and hiring momentum. While gross domestic product grew at its fastest pace in two years during the July–September quarter, job creation has slowed significantly. Employers have added an average of just 28,000 jobs per month since March, compared with roughly 400,000 monthly additions during the post-pandemic hiring surge between 2021 and 2023.Upcoming labour market data is expected to show modest improvement. Economists anticipate that January employment numbers, due next week, may show around 70,000 new jobs added, up from 50,000 in December.Recent private data has also pointed to subdued hiring conditions. Payroll processor ADP reported that private sector employers added only 22,000 jobs last month, far below market forecasts. Separately, outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas said companies announced more than 108,000 job cuts, the highest monthly total since October and the weakest January reading since 2009.Commenting on the trend, Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union, said: “The hiring recession isn’t going to end anytime soon. Job openings in December just fell to their lowest level since September 2020. It’s yet another sign of how little hiring – or interest in hiring – is happening in this economy.”Economists remain divided on the outlook, debating whether hiring will eventually pick up to match strong economic growth, whether growth may slow to reflect labour market weakness, or whether advances in artificial intelligence and automation could allow output to expand without significant job creation.","US job openings fell to 6.5 million in December from 6.9 million in November.

Alphabet said its spending on equipment and other investments could double this year to about $180 billion, far exceeding analysts’ expectations of less than $119 billion, according to FactSet.Bond markets also reflected risk-off sentiment.

He had also publicly celebrated Bitcoin crossing $100,000 for the first time in December 2024.The cryptocurrency, however, has seen sharp swings. In April last year, Bitcoin fell below $75,000 after Trump announced sweeping US tariffs that rattled global markets. It later rebounded and hit a record high of $126,251.31 six months later.The latest weakness has also been linked to regulatory uncertainty. While the US Congress passed a law in July to regulate stablecoins, a broader cryptocurrency bill, the Clarity Act, remains stalled in the Senate.Bitcoin has also been hit by Trump’s nomination of former Federal Reserve governor Kevin Warsh to head the US central bank. Warsh is seen by observers as a defender of the Fed’s independence, which reassured traditional markets and prompted investors to sell safe-haven assets such as gold and silver, whose prices fell.Investors have also sold cryptocurrencies and other risk assets to raise cash, adding to pressure on digital tokens.Trump’s close ties to the crypto sector have also drawn criticism, as he has promoted his own cryptocurrency-related ventures since returning to office.

Gold also moved lower as pressure remained across precious metals.Spot silver dropped as much as 16.6% during the session, even after briefly climbing back above $90 an ounce in early Asian trading. Gold prices were also volatile, sliding by as much as 3.5%.“Sentiment seems to have turned soggy across most asset classes, including regional equities and metals,” Christopher Wong, a strategist at Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp Ltd told Bloomberg. He added that this highlights fragile sentiment and has triggerd “a feedback loop amid thin market liquidity.”The sharp fall follows a strong rally last month, when precious metals rose quickly due to speculative buying, global geopolitical tensions and worries over the independence of the US central bank. That rally ended abruptly late last week. Silver recorded its biggest ever one-day fall on Friday, while gold saw its steepest drop since 2013.Markets are now focused on the policy outlook after Kevin Warsh was nominated as the next Federal Reserve chair. President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that he would not have chosen Warsh if he had supported raising interest rates. In an interview with NBC News, Trump said there was “not much” doubt the Federal Reserve would cut rates again, which usually supports precious metals as they do not offer interest.“Price action is likely to remain volatile until there is greater certainty on the monetary policy outlook,” Standard Chartered Plc analysts including Sudakshina Unnikrishnan said in a note.

Around the crack of dawn, a line begins forming at a strip mall in Hyattsville, Maryland, as residents ranging from students to delivery workers and federal contractors wait to sign up for food assistance.""Right now, it's a lot -- paying rent, buying food,"" said Shirleyann Desormeaux, a chef supporting four children in her household.Even with two incomes, ""it's still not enough,"" the 58-year-old added.She said she was keen to work, but has experienced having her hours cut as businesses struggle too.Desormeaux was among 100 or so people turning up in near-freezing temperatures in Hyattsville, a suburb of the US capital Washington, to seek groceries for their families, as anxiety about living costs rises in the world's biggest economy.Although US economic growth has been solid, with President Donald Trump's administration touting Wall Street records and tax relief, analysts warn that a ""K-shaped economy"" has taken hold.This is a situation where wealthier households benefit from rising asset values, but median- and lower-income families increasingly struggle.Nearly 60 percent of consumer spending in the third quarter last year came from the top 20 percent of income earners, according to Mark Zandi of Moody's Analytics.In the greater Washington area, some 36 percent of households experienced food insecurity in the past year, according to the Capital Area Food Bank.""We're seeing more individuals in what we would traditionally consider higher-income quartiles,"" said Radha Muthiah, the food bank's CEO.That means a family of four making $90,000 to $120,000 a year could find themselves in need of ""extra assistance in putting food on the table,"" she told AFP.A key reason is ""prolonged, sustained levels of inflation"" after the Covid-19 pandemic, with wage growth not keeping pace, Muthiah said.""People are suffering,"" Desormeaux said.Salih Taylor, a federal worker, said he had not considered visiting a food drive until speaking with his church's pastor.""I used to be like, 'I've got food, I don't need it,'"" the 49-year-old told AFP. But he conceded: ""It helps out a lot.""Food prices in December were 3.1 percent higher than a year ago, although Trump has said there is ""virtually no inflation.""While Taylor makes around $4,200 a month, his salary quickly goes towards his mortgage, utilities and food.Now, he occasionally collects free groceries, including for his mother.""I'm scraping,"" he chuckled dryly, saying his family has cut back on eating out and going on longer drives.Pastor Oliver Carter of No Limits Outreach Ministries, which runs the distribution point in Hyattsville, said he sees rising demand and more immigrants seeking aid since food stamps were slashed for many asylum seekers.""Now, they're left to fend for themselves,"" he said.Federal funding cuts under the Trump administration also meant less support for food drives.""It's really a struggle now to continue doing what we do,"" he said.Beyond the US capital area, a New York Times/Siena poll in January flagged a widespread belief that a middle-class lifestyle is out of reach for most people.For Delaware resident Tricia Jones, who has lived in a hotel room with her husband and toddler for months, this sentiment strikes home.Jones, 46, temporarily lost her income source after spinal surgery last year. Her family was soon unable to afford rent, and she turned to GoFundMe at one point to raise funds.While Jones and her husband are both employed now, she said: ""The pay doesn't keep up with the cost of living.""""We don't get any assistance with childcare,"" she added. ""I couldn't even get assistance with a hotel voucher, because they told me that I work.""Meanwhile, the cost of groceries has climbed. A loaf of bread easily costs $6 and the price of milk has recently risen from $3.79 to $5.79, she said.With a salary of around $1,300, ""there's no way I can pay $1,800 a month for rent on top of all my utilities and childcare,"" she said.""There's no way to stretch it.""","Food bank: 36 percent of Washington area households experienced food insecurity in past year. Food prices in December were 3.1 percent higher than a year ago, although Trump has said there is ""virtually no inflation"" Nearly 60 percent of consumer spending in the third quarter last year came from the top 20 percent of income earners.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127922051,imgsize-27632,width-400,resizemode-4/127922051.jpg"

"If India stops buying Russian oil, what it could mean for Moscow’s revenues — explained",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/if-india-stops-buying-russian-oil-what-it-could-mean-for-russias-revenues-explained/articleshow/127914097.cms,"“India Will Buy Oil From US…” White House After Trade Deal

Sanctions pressure and supply re-routing risks

Short-term flows may fall further

Russia could face a sharp drop in oil revenues if US President Donald Trump succeeds in pushing India to scale back or halt purchases of Russian crude, potentially forcing Moscow to cut prices to attract alternative buyers, analysts and traders told Reuters.The development comes after Trump said a recent US-India trade deal included provisions linked to India halting Russian oil imports, even as Washington increases pressure on Moscow amid ongoing Ukraine peace negotiations.India has not officially halted purchases, citing energy security needs and the importance of access to cheaper crude. However, recent data indicates Indian refiners have adopted a more cautious approach, already affecting Russia’s earnings.According to Reuters calculations, India’s imports of Russian oil fell 22% to 1.38 million barrels per day in December from November — the lowest level since January 2023. Russia’s share in India’s oil imports dropped to 27.4%, while OPEC’s share rose to 53.2%. This follows a peak of nearly 2 million barrels per day in June 2025.“Any further reduction would already be meaningful, because there is only one relevant alternative buyer — China — which has also its limitations in taking in sanctioned crude,” David Wech of Vortexa consultancy told Reuters.Analysts said widening discounts and shrinking buyer pools are already pushing Russian oil prices to record lows, while Moscow’s budget is facing strain due to weaker energy revenues.Russia has faced nearly 30,000 Western sanctions linked to the Ukraine war since 2014 but has managed to redirect oil flows from Europe towards China, India and Turkey. However, Turkey has also reduced purchases in recent months.Russia’s total oil exports stood at 4.91 million barrels per day in December, with China accounting for about 2.3 million barrels per day, according to the International Energy Agency.If India were to sharply cut imports, Russia would likely need to divert supplies to China at deeper discounts or cut production, said Igor Yushkov of Russia’s government-run Financial University.“Output and export cuts would lead to an oil shortage. Hence we are not seeing a full US ban on Russian oil imports — they would suffer themselves from higher oil prices,” Yushkov said.Indian refiners have not received formal instructions to stop buying Russian oil and would require time to wind down existing contracts, sources told Reuters.Imports could decline further in April when Nayara Energy, a Russian-backed refinery with capacity of 400,000 barrels per day, undertakes scheduled maintenance for one month, traders said.Beyond April, trade flows will likely depend on the trajectory of Russia-Ukraine peace talks and India’s broader strategic stance.Trump has suggested India could increase purchases from the US or Venezuela to replace Russian crude. However, US crude differs in quality and cannot directly substitute Russian grades, while Venezuela’s export capacity remains limited, Alexandra Hermann of Oxford Economics told Reuters.Instead, crude from Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Iraq may emerge as more practical alternatives. However, analysts said steep discounts may continue to make Russian oil attractive for Indian buyers despite geopolitical pressure.","India has not officially halted purchases, citing energy security needs and the importance of access to cheaper crude.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume.

Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021.

Startups will play important role in helping India become 3rd largest economy: CEA Nageswaran,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/startups-will-play-important-role-in-helping-india-become-3rd-largest-economy-cea-nageswaran/articleshow/105332523.cms,"Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran





THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor (CEA) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran Udaan until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.Udaan built an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business still accounts for a very small part of India’s overall retail market but can balloon to $150 billion in sales and yield a 100% return on capital invested in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co. estimates published in the Mint newspaper.Bengaluru-based Udaan has also ventured into financing through its fintech unit which helps shopkeepers get working capital loans to buy inventory. That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says.

How India's GDP has been growing

What SBI report said on savings and investment

Incremental capital output ratio

NEW DELHI: India's gross domestic product (GDP) data for the third quarter (October-December 2022) received a word of caution from the former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan In an interview with news agency PTI, Rajan that India is ""dangerously close"" to the Hindu rate of growth in view of subdued private sector investment, high interest rates and slowing global growth.India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying"".However, a report released by the State Bank of India (SBI) economists on Tuesday dismissed arguments that India is dangerously close to Hindu rate of growth saying such statements are ""ill-conceived, biased and premature"".The term 'Hindu growth rate' was coined by late economist Raj Krishna in 1978 to describe the slow growth in the country.It basically refers to the low pace of economic growth rates during 1950s to 1980s. During this period, the Indian economy averaged 3.5%.A former lecturer at the Delhi School of Economics (DSE), Krishna noted that only if the rate of growth is persistently slow and accompanied by low per-capita GDP, then it will be known as Hindu rate of growth but it has to factor in population growth as well.Before economic reforms of 1991, India's economic growth remained stagnant and low, while per capita income averaged around 1.3%.Krishna termed this low growth situation to be a result of socialist policies of state control and import substitution.However, the economic situation changed when liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation (LPG) reforms came into effect in the year 1991, at a time when India faced balance of payment crisis.Over the years, many economists have strongly opposed the idea of 'Hindu growth rate' and the term never had universal acceptance.The Indian economy plunged into its very first technical recession in FY21 due to the impact of Covid-19 pandemic and the related nationwide lockdowns. GDP shrunk by an unprecedented 23.8% in the first quarter of the financial year 2020-21. However, due to spurt in economic activities in the subsequent quarters, the GDP decline started to narrow.However, if we look at the period before Covid-19 as well, India's growth curve shows a declining trend.From 8.26% in FY17, GDP growth plunged to 3.74% in FY20. Shutdown of economic activities in FY21 in wake of Covid-19 only made matters worse.As lockdowns started to ease and business activities resumed, India's GDP also started rising. In Q1 of FY22, growth jumped to 20.1% mainly on account of low base effect. By the fourth quarter of FY22, growth came down to 4.10%.Similarly, the new financial year 2022-23 brought fresh economic challenges in the form of Russia-Ukraine war that impacted almost all major economies of the world, slowed the pace of growth, pushed inflation to record highs.As a result, the central banks of all advanced economies spurred into action and opted for monetary policy tightening to curb the soaring inflation.With persistently rising interest rates, India's economy grew by 4.4% in Q3 of FY23, as the Centre revised upwards GDP growth for previous year to 9.10% from 8.7% earlier.The report weighed recent GDP numbers against the available data on savings and investments for the past decade and highlighted some interesting points.""Quarterly growth numbers are noisy and should be best avoided for any serious interpretation (on an average, India's GDP growth has witnessed Rs 2 lakh crore upward revision for the 3 year ended FY23),"" the report said.Gross capital formation (GCF) by the government touched a high of 11.8% in 2021-22, up from 10.7% in 2020-21.""This also had a domino effect on private sector investment that jumped from 10 per cent to 10.8% over the same period,"" it said.In fact, Ecowrap added that the trends in GCF to gross output ratio or the plough back of funds for creation of fresh capacity shows that for public administration the ratio attained fresh peak in 2021-22 owing to the emphasis on capital expenditure in recent budgets.At the aggregate level, gross capital formation is supposed to have crossed 32% in 2022-23, the highest level since 2018-19.According to the report, in 2021-22, gross savings have risen to 30% from 29% in 2020-21.""The ratio is supposed to have crossed 31 per cent in 2022-23, the highest since 2018-19. The household savings increased sharply during the pandemic period on account of sharp accretion in financial savings such as deposits,"" said the report by SBI's Economic Research Department.While household financial savings have since then moderated from 15.4% in 2020-21 to 11.1% in 2022-23, savings in physical assets have grown sharply to 11.8% in 2021-22 from 10.7% in 2020-21.The report further analysed Incremental Capital Output ratio (ICOR) -- which measures additional units of capital (investment) needed to produce additional units of output. It said that the ratio has been improving.""ICOR which was 7.5 in FY 12 is now only 3.5 in FY22. Clearly, only half of capital is now needed for next unit of output,"" the report noted.Such reducing ICOR in the current years reflects a relatively increasing efficiency of capital and shows that the economy is on a sound footing, the report said.""From that point of view, future GDP growth rates even at 7% could still mean a decent number by any standards!,"" it added.","India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.

An employee is entitled for a 50 per cent amount of the last drawn salary as pension.OPS was discontinued by the NDA government in 2003 with effect from April 1, 2004.Under the new pension scheme (NPS), employees contribute 10 per cent of their basic salary towards pension while the government contributes 14 per cent.Governments of Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand have informed the central government/ Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA about their decision to restart OPS for their employees.The government of Punjab on November 18, 2022, issued a notification regarding implementation of OPS for the state government employees who are being covered under NPS. Jharkhand too has decided to revert to OPS.",Former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan has expressed his concern over the decision of some states to restart the old pension scheme.

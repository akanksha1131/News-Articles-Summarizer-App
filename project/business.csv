Gold price prediction today: Gold prices are likely to maintain their bullish trend over the coming few weeks, says Maneesh Sharma, AVP - Commodities & Currencies, Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers. The expert shares his views and recommendations for gold investors: Gold began the week on an impressive bullish note, soaring to fresh all-time highs above $3,650/Oz in Spot. The move extended last week’s rally amid growing conviction that the Federal Reserve (Fed) may cut interest rates at its September monetary policy meeting, a shift markets now treat as a near certainty following a string of weak US labour market data.The US Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) report on Friday showed a slowdown in hiring in August, while the Unemployment Rate rose to the highest level since 2021, confirming that labour market conditions in the world’s biggest economy are slumping.Apart from this, political turmoil in Japan and France, along with persistent geopolitical tensions, contributed to limiting any corrective pullback for the spot gold pair. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics to publish the preliminary estimate of the annual revision of Nonfarm Payrolls later on Tuesday night, might drive the USD & USD/JPY pair leading to volatile moves in gold prices.Additionally, rising demand from major central banks have contributed to the upside so far as Official data showed this week that the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) added gold to its reserves in August, extending purchases of bullion into a 10th straight month although the pace of buying slows down due to higher prices.Traders now look to the US Producer Price Index (PPI) & the US Consumer Price Index (CPI), due on Wednesday & Thursday, respectively, for a fresh impetus & direction. If the report comes in hotter than-expected the outcome could boost the US Dollar (USD) & weigh on yellow metal leading to profit booking moves.Overall, the fundamental backdrop suggests that the path of least resistance for the spot gold is to the upside, though overbought conditions warrant some caution in near term.From a technical perspective in spot gold, on a daily time frame technical indicators like RSI holds well above the 70.0 mark which makes it prudent to wait for some near-term consolidation or a modest pullback before positioning for the next leg up. Any corrective decline following through to data in the days ahead, could still attract dip-buyers near the $3,600 - 3540 per oz levels which presents an intermediate support enroute last Thursday's corrective phase.Meanwhile, the trend remains bullish on a medium-term perspective of 3 - 4 weeks as an upside target of $ 3720 - 3750 per oz looks likely to be tested in spot markets which translates to a range of Rs 1,12,000 - 1,12,500 per 10 gm. levels on MCX futures contract","Gold began the week on an impressive bullish note, soaring to fresh all-time highs above $3,650/Oz in Spot.

According to Bajaj Broking Research, the top stock picks for September 12, 2025 are Reliance Industries, and Persistent Systems. Here’s its view on Nifty and Bank Nifty:

Index View: NIFTY

Progress on Indo-US Bilateral Trade Deal Negotiations – Market participants will closely track any material developments on the trade front, which could act as a significant sentiment driver and impact sector-specific flows. US Macro Data Prints – Upcoming releases of MoM CPI and labor market data will be crucial in shaping expectations around the Fed’s policy trajectory and broader risk appetite. India CPI Inflation Print – A critical domestic macro indicator, with any deviation from consensus likely to influence RBI’s policy stance and equity/bond market dynamics. US Dollar Index (DXY) – The DXY continues to trade below the structural breakdown zone around the 100 mark, reinforcing a corrective bias in the greenback, which could support EM flows. Crude Oil Price Action – Brent crude remains capped below its 20-week EMA, signaling bearish undertones in the commodity and potentially easing inflationary pressures for import-dependent economies like India.

Stock market recommendations:Benchmark indices exhibited a range-bound yet upwardly biased price action during the week, underpinned by renewed optimism surrounding Indo-US trade dialogues. This positive undertone was further supported by constructive global cues and persistent accumulation in select index heavyweights, enhancing overall market sentiment.The Nifty 50 has taken approximately 10 weeks to retrace a mere 38.2% of its preceding 12-week uptrend from 21,744 to 25,669. Such a shallow retracement post a strong impulse leg is indicative of underlying market strength and bullish structural integrity.Over the past three weeks, the Nifty has been consolidating within a well-defined range of 24,400–25,000 and is currently positioned near the upper bound of this range. A sustained breakout above the psychological mark of 25,000 is likely to trigger a short-term continuation move towards the key resistance zone of 25,200–25,250.A decisive close above 25,250 would mark a trend reversal confirmation from the ongoing corrective phase and could potentially unlock further upside towards the 25,500 handle in the coming weeks.On the downside, immediate support is seen near the 24,700 level, while critical short-term support resides in the 24,400–24,300 zone. This area represents a confluence of recent swing lows and the 200-day EMA, thereby making it a pivotal support cluster to watch for trend validation.In the broader market space, both the Nifty Midcap and Small Cap indices continue to hover near their 52-week exponential moving averages, which have been respected since April 2025. This prolonged resilience around a major moving average base offers a constructive setup for incremental accumulation, particularly in quality mid and small-cap names.Key Monitorables Going Forward:The Bank Nifty has resumed its positive momentum, as reflected by the higher-high and higher-low formation on the daily chart, effectively negating the recent corrective trend.The 200-day EMA has proven to be a reliable support zone on the daily timeframe. Following a phase of consolidation around this crucial moving average, the index has absorbed selling pressure and is now positioning itself for the next leg of its up move.A breakout from the recent consolidation zone further reinforces the continuation of the uptrend, with immediate support placed at Monday’s low of 54,300. On the upside, the index carries the potential to move towards 55,350, based on the measured move of the consolidation range (53,779–54,670).On the downside, key support is placed at 53,500–53,300, which coincides with the 200-day EMA and the swing low of May 2025.Reliance Industries' stock has undergone a corrective phase over the past two months and is currently consolidating near a crucial support zone. This technical setup offers a favorable risk-reward profile, positioning the stock for a potential bullish reversal and the next leg of the uptrend.The stock is currently exhibiting base-building price action around the key demand zone of ₹1300–₹1340, which marks a confluence of multiple technical factors supporting a potential reversal: (a) 50% retracement of the previous April-June 2025 up move (1115-1551), (b) 52 weeks EMA placed around 1360 (c) Previous major breakout area placed around 1330 levels which is likely to reverse its role and act as support in the medium term as per change of polarity concept.The ongoing corrective phase appears to be nearing exhaustion, with price action indicating the potential for a fresh bullish reversal. We anticipate stock to resume its primary uptrend and retest the previous swing highs around ₹1540 in the upcoming quarters, which correspond to the key resistance zones marked by the September 2024 and July 2025 peaks.The stock after the recent corrective decline is forming a potential double bottom in the daily chart thus offers fresh entry opportunity with favorable risk-reward set up.It has generated a breakout above the falling trendline containing the last 3 months corrective decline highlighting reversal of the corrective trend. Strong support is placed in the range of 5000-5050 levels being the confluence of the last two months lows and key retracement area.We expect the stock to head higher towards 5930 levels being the 80% retracement of the previous June-August decline (6180-5008).","According to Bajaj Broking Research, the top stock picks for September 12, 2025 are Reliance Industries, and Persistent Systems. The Bank Nifty has resumed its positive momentum, as reflected by the higher-high and higher-low formation on the daily chart, effectively negating the recent corrective trend.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123841325,imgsize-90922,width-400,resizemode-4/top-stocks-to-buy.jpg"
'E20 ethanol-blended petrol row paid political campaign': Nitin Gadkari,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/e20-ethanol-blended-petrol-row-paid-political-campaign-nitin-gadkari/articleshow/123841377.cms,"



NEW DELHI: Road transport minister Nitin Gadkari on Thursday dismissed criticism against E20 (ethanol-blended petrol), saying a ""paid"" social media campaign is being run to ""target me politically.""""The way your industry works, so does politics,"" he said in response to a question at annual convention of automobile industry body SIAM. ""Social media campaign was paid; it was to target me politically. There is no fact in it; everything is clear,"" he said.Gadkari claimed that Supreme Court dismissing a PIL has made everything clear, and added that ethanol blending in petrol is crucial to reduce dependence on imports.SIAM and premier vehicle research organisation ARAI have shared their findings on ethanol blending in petrol, he said, adding India's ethanol programme has helped farmers. He added because of ethanol made from maize, they are now getting a better price, and farmers have gained Rs 45,000 crore as a result.Later, while addressing two more events, one of BOCI, country's apex bus operators' entity, and the other of sugar industry body ISMA, Gadkari said use of ethanol and other alternative fuels will not only save country's foreign exchequer but also reduce air pollution. He said govt is looking at giving some incentive for production and use of construction equipment that use alternative fuel like ethanol.","Road transport minister Nitin Gadkari dismissed criticism against E20 (ethanol- blended petrol) He said a ""paid"" social media campaign is being run to ""target me politically"" He added that ethanol blending in petrol is crucial to reduce dependence on imports.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123841438,imgsize-35298,width-400,resizemode-4/.jpg"
Tata Trusts vice-chairman Vijay Singh exits Tata Sons board,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/tata-trusts-vice-chairman-vijay-singh-exits-tata-sons-board/articleshow/123840130.cms,".

since Hyundai Motor India’s $3.3-billion offering.





MUMBAI: In an abrupt move, Tata Trusts vice-chairman Vijay Singh (77) has resigned from the board of Tata Sons , a day before the holding company's directors were to meet, and amid an impending RBI-mandated IPO deadline.Two main units of Tata Trusts - Sir Dorabji Tata Trust and Sir Ratan Tata Trust - collectively hold approximately 52% in Tata Sons, the parent of the $165-billion Tata Group, which has a diverse portfolio ranging from aviation to automobiles.Singh served as a nominee director of Tata Trusts on Tata Sons board. He will continue to be a trustee of Tata Trusts. The move comes as a surprise since nominee directors of Tata Trusts do not have a retirement age, unlike other directors on Tata Sons board. For instance, executive, non-executive, and independent directors of Tata Sons retire at the ages of 65, 70, and 75, respectively.However, a resolution by Tata Trusts dated Oct 17, 2024, stipulates that nominated directors on Tata Sons board who reach the age of 75 must be reviewed annually. During Tata Trusts board meeting on Thursday, the nominated directors' ages were reviewed.The majority of the trustees supported the review and the induction of younger individuals onto the Tata Sons board.The other two nominee directors on Tata Sons board are Tata Trusts chairman Noel Tata (69) and vice-chairman Venu Srinivasan (72). Singh declined to comment, when contacted.This was Singh's second stint at Tata Sons board. The former defence secretary was initially appointed to the board in June 2013, but stepped down in July 2018 upon reaching 70 years. At that time, the retirement age for Tata Trusts nominees was 70.He was reappointed to the board in Feb 2022 at the age of 74. This was possible as former Tata Trusts chairman Ratan Tata had introduced an unspecified retirement age for nominated directors.Tata Sons and Tata Trusts have been using retirement age as a tool to either extend or end the term of a board member at the company. For instance, in the past, the retirement age for non-executive directors was revised to 75 from 70, which had allowed Ratan Tata to continue as chairman of Tata Sons until that age.Singh earned Rs 3.2 crore as commission from Tata Sons in FY25. Singh's departure, along with the recent end of tenures of two other Tata Sons directors - former JLR CEO Ralf Speth and Piramal Enterprises boss Ajay Piramal - opens up opportunities for new members. These changes have left Tata Sons board with six members. According to Tata Sons' articles of association, Tata Trusts can nominate one-third of the directors. However, this requirement (two of six board seats) is currently fulfilled by Noel and Srinivasan.The development occurs as Tata Sons' board is scheduled to meet on Friday, with the looming RBI-mandated IPO deadline for both the company and its subsidiary Tata Capital approaching by the end of this month. Tata Capital has sought a short extension for the launch of its $1.9-billion IPO from the RBI, while Tata Sons has applied to RBI to surrender its core investment company registration to avoid the IPO. Tata Capital intends to launch the IPO in the first half of Oct, which will make it the largest in the country.Tata Capital intends to launch the IPO in the first half of Oct, which will make it the largest in the country","Tata Trusts vice-chairman Vijay Singh (77) has resigned from the board of Tata Sons.

Govt calls meeting to discuss plan for inventory-based e-comm exports,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/govt-calls-meeting-to-discuss-plan-for-inventory-based-e-comm-exports/articleshow/123840117.cms,"



MUMBAI: In its bid to push e-commerce exports and open up the global market for scores of small and medium sellers, the govt is set to begin consultations with the industry to draw a framework for allowing inventory based model for e-commerce exports.While there have been growing calls from the industry to open up the inventory model for e-commerce exports, the progress on the talks comes at a time when the US has scrapped a provision that allowed tax free import of small packages worth up to $800, hurting growth prospects for small sellers.The proposal, if implemented, will make a deviation from govt's current FDI norms that bar foreign e-commerce marketplaces such as Amazon and Walmart's Flipkart from holding inventory, probably explaining New Delhi's urgency to boost export growth.Although it has been in the pipeline for more than a year, the move coincides with signals that the India-US trade talks may resume soon.The meeting called by Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) on Sept 15 is expected to be attended by Amazon and Walmart besides representatives from logistics companies and other govt departments, note of the meeting agenda gathered from sources showed.At present, less than 10% of local MSMEs selling online participate in global e-commerce exports constrained by a host of factors including complex documentation, compliance requirements and high logistics costs.Studies indicate that nearly 87% of enterprises onboarded for e-commerce exports during 2020-24 exited by 2025. ""The proposal envisages a third-party export facilitation model, wherein a dedicated export entity linked to e-commerce platforms would manage compliance, logistics, and customs processes. This would enable MSMEs to focus on product development, quality, and branding,"" said an agenda note shared by DGFT, which has been reviewed by TOI. Allowing the move may require updates to DPIIT's FDI guidelines, including review of the prohibition on inventory based e-comm for export-only models, the note said.","The govt is set to begin consultations with the industry to draw a framework for allowing inventory based model for e-commerce exports.

Private equity majors eye minority stake in medical device company,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/private-equity-majors-eye-minority-stake-in-medical-device-company/articleshow/123840112.cms,"



NEW DELHI: A clutch of global private equity (PE) players are eyeing a minority stake in Romsons Group, a medical device manufacturer, for around Rs 1,200 crore, in one of the largest deals in this space.PE firms, including Warburg Pincus and TA Associates, have emerged as frontrunners, sources told TOI. The Agra-based group, founded in 1952, is among the largest medical consumables manufacturers, with a portfolio spanning syringes, catheters, infusion sets, and other disposables. Due diligence is currently underway, and the transaction is likely to be closed within next two-to-four weeks, sources close to development say.The family-run company has built a distribution network that reaches hospitals across India and exports to over 100 countries. With steady demand in critical care and diagnostics, Romsons has positioned itself as a market leader in low-cost, high-volume products, attracting investors seeking scale and global reach. Company officials were not available for comments.Over the last couple of years, the sector has witnessed a flurry of private equity and venture capital investments, that have also led to an increase in the local manufacturing footprint.The past few months, in particular, have seen a marked uptick in domestic production, supported by fresh capital from both domestic firms and multinational players, seeking to tap into growing medtech market. The industry, currently valued around $16 billion, is projected to nearly double to $30 billion by 2030.Among large deals, Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA) invested $200 million for about a 3% stake in Gujarat-based medtech leader Meril in July. Earlier, Warburg Pincus acquired a majority stake in ophthalmic equipment company Appasamy Associates for $300 million, Samara Capital invested $150 million in stent manufacturer SMT, while Everstone Capital injected funds into another stent manufacturer Translumina.","PE firms, including Warburg Pincus and TA Associates, have emerged as frontrunners.

MUMBAI: The rupee closed weaker on Thursday, settling at 88.44 against the dollar, compared with 88.10 in the previous session, marking a fresh record low. The currency opened at 88.12, touched a high of 88.09 and a low of 88.45 during the day, slipping past its earlier low of 88.36 hit last week.The decline comes amid persistent foreign outflows of over $11 billion this year and mounting pressure from US tariffs, which have dented investor confidence and clouded India's trade outlook. Exporters remain uncertain about order flows while importers are hedging more aggressively, intensifying demand for dollars.Traders said RBI has been intervening by selling dollars to smooth volatility but is not defending any particular level. The rupee's weakness contrasts with most regional peers, which have found support from expectations of a Fed rate cut. However, sentiment around the Indian currency remains fragile, with tariff pressures on labour-intensive sectors likely to keep it under strain.""Rupee traded weak by 0.35% at 88.40 as mixed FII flows and a firmer dollar index kept pressure intact. Focus remains on the US CPI data, which could drive volatility in the dollar and in turn the rupee,"" said Jateen Trivedi, VP research analyst, LKP Securities.","Rupee closed weaker on Thursday, settling at 88.44 against the dollar, compared with 88.10 in the previous session.

MUMBAI: Indian banks are staring at a tougher year as profitability weakens and finance companies step up lending, according to a report by S&P Global Market Intelligence. Aggregate dividends of 12 large banks are projected to fall 4.2% to $5.98 billion in FY26, from $6.24 billion in FY25. This comes after a strong FY25, when banks posted double-digit credit growth and record profits.Now, compressed net interest margins due to rate cuts, higher deposit costs, and slower loan demand are expected to weigh on earnings.HDFC Bank and Bank of Baroda are forecast to cut dividends for the first time in at least four years, to Rs 8.25 and Rs 7.90 per share respectively. By contrast, State Bank of India is likely to keep payouts flat at about Rs 16 per share, while ICICI Bank may lift dividends to Rs 12.At the same time, finance companies are expected to expand faster than banks. S&P Global Ratings projects loan growth of 21%-22% for rated fincos over the next two years, compared with 11%-12% for banks. Their retail focus, underpenetrated markets and stronger net interest margins are seen as drivers.","Aggregate dividends of 12 large banks are projected to fall 4.2% to $5.98 billion in FY26.

Union Minister Piyush Goyal Eyes India-US Trade Deal By November Despite Donald Trump’s Tariff War

India-US ties: Signs of thaw

Special relationship

Why has the US softened its stance on trade deal talks?

Friction in ties remains





Amidst signs of thaw in the India-US trade deal issues, government officials are likely to travel to America next week. The recent social media post exchanges between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and US President Donald Trump indicate an improvement in relations following a period of tension.Trade talks are set to resume next week, following a pause triggered by the US imposing additional 25% tariff on India regarding Russian oil purchases. Both leaders are also expected to hold a telephone discussion soon.According to an ET report, Rajesh Agarwal, the chief trade negotiator, will travel to Washington for continued discussions with American officials. A source familiar with the matter quoted in the report indicated the situation remains fluid, with uncertainty surrounding potential US tariff concessions in the coming months.Modi and Trump have expressed mutual goodwill, with the PM responding to the US President's friendly overture on Wednesday. Trump had earlier referred to the Prime Minister as a ""dear friend"" and indicated positive developments in the previously stalled trade discussions.""India and the US are close friends,"" Modi wrote on X. ""I am confident our trade negotiations will pave the way for unlocking the limitless potential of the India-US partnership.Our teams are working to conclude these discussions at the earliest.""""I am also looking forward to speaking with President Trump. We will work together to secure a brighter, more prosperous future for both our people,"" Modi said in response to Trump's mention of the upcoming telephone conversation.On Wednesday morning, Trump posted on Truth Social stating that he was ""pleased to announce India and the US are continuing negotiations to address the trade barriers between our two nations.""Also Read | India-US trade deal: Should India be enthralled by Donald Trump’s outreach to PM Modi? ""I look forward to speaking with my very good friend, Prime Minister Modi, in the upcoming weeks,"" the US President said. ""I feel certain there will be no difficulty in coming to a successful conclusion for both of our great countries!""A source told ET that the informal meeting between Russian, Indian and Chinese leaders at the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit in Tianjin influenced this moderated stance from Trump. This gathering sparked discussions within pro-Trump circles regarding India-US relations.Notably, in the past ten days, Trump has refrained from claiming credit for the India-Pakistan ceasefire arrangement, an issue that previously caused friction with New Delhi.Reports indicate that Trump has requested European Union authorities to evaluate implementing up to 100% tariffs on Chinese goods, with suggestions to extend similar measures to India.Diplomatic friction has increased following the US implementation of a 25% duty on Indian imports, subsequently increased to 50% due to India's continued Russian oil procurement.Also Read | Donald Trump wants EU to impose up to 100% tariffs on India, China - but it is unlikely to agree; here’s why Various Trump administration officials, including White House adviser Peter Navarro, who maintains scrutiny on India and BRICS, accuse that India's oil purchases from Russia are supporting Moscow's military operations in Ukraine.India has maintained its position on strategic independence, explaining that its Russian oil purchases are driven by domestic needs and global price stability considerations.Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman recently affirmed India's continued Russian oil imports, emphasising that energy decisions follow national interests and economic reasoning rather than external pressure. She noted that the Reserve Bank of India is diversifying its US treasury holdings whilst purchasing gold.","Trade talks are set to resume next week, following a pause triggered by the US imposing additional 25% tariff on India regarding Russian oil purchases.

Urban Company’s Rs 1,900 crore initial public offering (IPO) has attracted robust demand, with overall subscriptions reaching 5.53 times (553%) by the second day of bidding on Thursday.According to ET, investor sentiment also reflected positively in the grey market, where the IPO traded at around 34% premium (Rs 35 GMP) over the upper price band of Rs 103, implying a potential listing price close to Rs 138.Retail investors showed the strongest appetite, subscribing 10.82 times the 1.93 crore shares allocated to them.Non-Institutional Investors (NIIs) subscribed 7.85 times their quota of 2.90 crore shares, while Qualified Institutional Buyers (QIBs) picked up 1.31 times their 5.80 crore share allocation.The IPO, which remains open until September 12, consists of a fresh issue worth Rs 472 crore and an offer-for-sale (OFS) of Rs 1,428 crore by existing shareholders.The stock is scheduled to list on the NSE and BSE on September 17. Prior to opening, the company had raised Rs 854 crore from anchor investors, including GIC, Fidelity, and Norges Bank.Founded in 2014, Urban Company operates in 47 cities across India and has expanded internationally into the UAE, Singapore, and Saudi Arabia.

Donald Trump’s New Delhi Gamble: Sergio Gor, Called ‘A Snake’ By Elon Musk, Becomes US Ambassador





: US ambassador-designate to India Sergio Gor on Thursday said Washington and New Delhi are ""not that far apart” on tariff issues and indicated an agreement between the two sides is imminent. The upbeat assessment came even as he, along with top officials and lawmakers, talked up long-term strategic ties between the two countries that have been rocked by differences over trade matters.At a confirmation hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Gor disclosed that President Trump has invited India’s commerce and trade ministers to visit US and they will be meeting with USTR Jamieson Greer in Washington next week. ""Part of that will include hopefully a deal. We are not that far apart right now... In fact, they're negotiating the nitty gritty of a deal,” Gor said.At a broader level, Gor and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who unusually dropped by at the hearing to introduce ambassadorial nominees, tamped down on talk of a rupture in ties because of the protracted tariff dispute, asserting that ""India is among America’s TOP relationships for shaping the world’s future.”""The story of the 21st century will be written in the Indo-Pacific. It’s so important that we have changed the name of the combatant command (from Asia-Pacific)...India is at the core of that,” Rubio said in his remarks, challenging reports, based on draft of the upcoming National Defense Strategy, that the Trump administration is dialing down commitments in the region in favor of a more isolationist posture.Gor also said President Trump remained committed to the Quad partnership with India, Japan, and Australia, without offering a firm date committment that the US President would visit the next Quad meeting, scheduled to be held in India later this year.He also spoke of the “deep friendship” Trump has with PM Modi saying it was “something unique.""""In fact, if you have noticed, when he has gone after other nations, he tends to go after their leaders for putting us in that position, and for the United States imposing those tariffs. When the President has been critical of India, he has gone out of his way to compliment Prime Minister Modi, they have an incredible relationship,” he said.PM Modi was conspicuously cool about Trump’s recent remarks on their personal friendship, emphasizing friendship between the two countries after the US President slapped punitive tariff amounting to sanctions against India for buying Russian oil.In fact, asked by Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen why India had copped tariff penalty and China had escaped it despite buying more Russian oil, Gor proffered the following explanation: “We hold our friends to different standards. Frankly, we expect more from India than we do sometimes from other nations.”There was no indication at any point during the hearing that Washington would ease pressure on New Delhi on the Russian oil issue despite all the upbeat sentiments about enhancing strategic ties. In fact, SFRC Chair Jim Risch, a Republican from Idaho, with a population less than that of a middling Indian city, told Gor that he must impress on India that the US ""will not tolerate support for Putin’s war machine.”Still, as several lawmakers expressed concern over the recent SCO summit where they perceived the leaders of Russia, China, and India getting close, Gor repeatedly asserted that the US and India had a lot more in common than they had with Russia or China.“If confirmed, I will ensure they (India) are pulled in our direction, not away from us,” he told lawmakers, some of whom spoke of his closeness to Trump and his direct access to the President.","US ambassador-designate to India Sergio Gor said Washington and New Delhi are ""not that far apart” on tariff issues.

Wall Street traded near record highs on Thursday as fresh US economic data reinforced expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates next week to support growth.The S&P 500 rose 0.3% in early trade after setting new records in the last two sessions, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 95 points and the Nasdaq composite added 0.4%, AP reported. Treasury yields stayed steady, signalling calm after the latest economic reports.Markets were buoyed by anticipation of a Fed rate cut, even as inflation remains above the 2% target and labour market data continues to show weakness.“Traders were already convinced the Fed will deliver its first cut to interest rates of the year at its next meeting, but they need inflation data until then to be mild enough not to derail those expectations,” analysts noted.Wall Street is betting the US economy can manage a “soft landing” — slowing enough to prompt monetary easing, but not collapsing into recession. An encouraging sign came from Wednesday’s wholesale inflation report, which showed price growth unexpectedly slowed in August.Among individual stocks, Opendoor jumped 36% after naming Shopify COO Kaz Nejatian as its new chief executive, with co-founders Keith Rabois and Eric Wu returning to the board.FedEx slipped 1.3% and UPS fell 2.1% after Bank of America downgraded both companies.In global markets, Europe’s major indexes gained at midday, with Germany’s DAX up 0.3%, Britain’s FTSE 100 advancing 0.5%, and France’s CAC 40 climbing 0.9%.In Asia, Japan’s Nikkei 225 surged 1.2% to 44,372.50, with SoftBank Group rallying 8.3% for a second straight day.

The European Central Bank (ECB) kept its benchmark deposit rate steady at 2% on Thursday, with inflation back under control and the eurozone economy showing resilience despite US President Donald Trump’s tariff measures.At the post-decision news conference, attention is expected to focus on ECB President Christine Lagarde’s remarks on France’s fiscal crisis and whether the bank could step in if market turmoil deepens due to the country’s rising deficit and political deadlock, AP reported.The ECB’s move comes as the US Federal Reserve signals the possibility of a rate cut at its September 17 meeting. Eurozone growth held at 0.1% in the second quarter, avoiding recession despite tariff disruptions, while S&P Global’s purchasing managers’ survey for August stood at 51.1, indicating expansion.Inflation in the eurozone was 2.1% in August, close to the ECB’s target. Having raised rates sharply between 2021 and 2023 to curb inflation, the bank has since lowered them as growth concerns mounted. Analysts believe another cut could follow in the coming months.The European Commission has also eased trade tensions by capping US tariffs on European goods at 15%, higher than pre-Trump levels but below the steeper rates initially threatened.France’s fiscal deficit, at 5.8% of GDP last year, has pushed up borrowing costs, fuelling market unease. Lagarde faces the challenge of signalling readiness to act in case of panic without suggesting that the ECB would bail out governments unwilling to rein in deficits.","The European Central Bank (ECB) kept its benchmark deposit rate steady at 2% on Thursday.

"US inflation data: Consumer prices rise to 2.9% in August, core inflation hits 3.1%",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-inflation-data-consumer-prices-rise-to-2-9-in-august-core-inflation-hits-3-1/articleshow/123831865.cms,"



US consumer inflation rose to 2.9% in August, its highest since January, as prices of gas, groceries and airfares jumped, according to the Labor Department. The figures come just ahead of next week’s Federal Reserve meeting, where policymakers are expected to cut interest rates despite persistent price pressures.The consumer price index (CPI) was up from 2.7% in July, while core inflation, excluding volatile food and energy costs, held steady at 3.1%. Both readings remain above the Fed’s 2% target. On a monthly basis, inflation quickened to 0.4% in August from 0.2% in July, with gas prices up 1.9%, grocery costs up 0.6% and airfares surging 5.9%, AP reported.The inflation print is the last major data point before the Fed’s two-day meeting beginning Tuesday, where officials are widely expected to lower the benchmark rate from 4.3% to about 4.1%. But the central bank is in a difficult position, balancing stubborn inflation with clear signs of labour market weakness.The unemployment rate ticked up to 4.3% in August, while jobless claims rose sharply by 27,000 to 263,000 — the highest in nearly four years. “Consumer inflation came in mildly hotter than forecast, but not nearly high enough to prevent the Fed from starting to cut rates next week,” Kathy Bostjancic, chief economist for Nationwide, told AP.“The labour market is losing steam and reinforces that the Fed needs to start cutting rates next week and that it will be the start of a series of rate reductions. ”Economists said rising layoffs and slowing hiring reinforce the case for monetary easing. Yet inflationary pressures — partly driven by President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs on imports — could restrain the Fed from cutting rates aggressively.Prices of clothing, furniture, appliances and rentals all rose in August, while hotel room tariffs were up 2.3%. Food costs continued to climb, with tomatoes, apples and beef leading the gains.The latest inflation data has also added to political tensions. Trump, who has pushed for deeper cuts, recently attempted to fire Fed governor Lisa Cook, though a court blocked the move and allowed her to retain her position while the case proceeds.Businesses large and small are grappling with higher costs. Raleigh-based restaurant owner Cheetie Kumar said her input prices are up 10% from last year, with coffee costs tripling and spices doubling. “Those are things I cannot source locally … I don’t know any nutmeg growers in North Carolina,” she said.Cosmetics maker E.L.F. said it raised prices by $1 earlier this year, but CFO Mandy Fields admitted last month it is unclear if that will be enough to offset tariff costs. Retailers such as Home Depot and Macy’s have described their price hikes as modest, though Walmart has warned of further increases as inventories are replenished.","Consumer price index (CPI) was up from 2.7% in July.

US raid on Hyundai-LG plant: Donald Trump offered detained South Korean workers a chance to stay; only one accepted,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-raid-on-hyundai-lg-plant-donald-trump-offered-detained-south-korean-workers-a-chance-to-stay-only-one-accepted/articleshow/123829089.cms,"Donald Trump offered detained South Korean workers a chance to stay





US President Donald Trump had offered hundreds of South Korean workers arrested during a Georgia immigration raid the opportunity to remain in the United States but nearly all opted to return home, South Korean officials said on Thursday.As per news agency Reuters, only one worker decided to stay.The president’s offer, reportedly aimed at encouraging the employees to train American workers, led to a one-day delay of a chartered flight initially scheduled to return the group to South Korea.The flight is now expected to depart later on Thursday. Television footage showed the workers boarding buses at around 2 am (local time) from the barbed-wire fenced detention centre in Georgia, heading to Atlanta airport.Unlike standard deportations, the detainees were not handcuffed, meeting a key demand from Seoul, as per Reuters.Last week, around 300 South Koreans were detained at a $4.3 billion battery factory under construction by Hyundai Motor and LG Energy Solution, alongside more than 150 other foreign workers.The operation, which involved armoured vehicles and shackles, drew widespread criticism in South Korea for its perceived heavy-handedness.President Lee Jae Myung, speaking at a press conference marking his first 100 days in office, warned that the raid could deter South Korean investment in the United States. “Our businesses that have entered the United States are likely in a state of serious confusion,” he said.Lee stressed that improving the US visa system for skilled workers is essential, noting that without it, companies may hesitate to send employees for future projects.Some lawmakers in Seoul acknowledged that a few workers may have overstayed or misused short-term visas, but South Korean companies have long relied on a grey area in visa rules to send specialists to US plants, a practice generally tolerated by previous administrations.In response to the incident, Washington and Seoul have agreed to discuss a new visa category for Korean workers, South Korean foreign minister Cho Hyun said. The aim is to ensure that detained workers can return to the US if needed.The raid also involved a smaller number of Japanese, Chinese, and Indonesian nationals.China’s foreign ministry said its embassy was assisting its citizens and urged US authorities to “enforce laws impartially and ensure the legitimate rights and interests of the involved Chinese citizens.”Japan confirmed three of its nationals were affected and is taking steps to protect them, as per AP.Some South Korean employees at other LG Energy Solution sites in the US have already left due to visa concerns, while the company has asked subcontractors to hire local staff as a contingency.Experts warn that unless the visa system is addressed, South Korean industrial investment in the US could slow, potentially affecting American economic activity.President Lee also noted a cultural difference in immigration enforcement. “In South Korea, we see foreigners coming on short-term visas to provide technical or educational services—it’s accepted,” he said. “But the US strictly enforces work and immigration rules, and our workers happened to be caught in one of those enforcement actions.”Following talks with US secretary of state Marco Rubio, Cho confirmed that a joint working group will be established to explore a visa category for Korean workers, aiming to prevent similar disruptions in the future.","Around 300 South Koreans were detained at a $4.3 billion battery factory under construction by Hyundai Motor and LG Energy Solution.

Oracle’s AI-fuelled surge

“AI changes everything”

Musk’s Tesla struggles





Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison briefly dethroned Elon Musk as the world’s richest man on Wednesday after shares of Oracle Corp soared more than 36 per cent in early trading.The surge followed a blockbuster earnings report that showcased multi-billion-dollar contracts with OpenAI, Meta, Nvidia, and Musk’s own AI venture, xAI.Ellison, who owns more than 40 per cent of Oracle, saw his fortune swell by nearly $100 billion within half an hour of markets opening.Bloomberg’s Billionaires Index placed him ahead of Musk, though the Tesla chief reclaimed the top spot by the day’s end as Oracle’s stock gave up some gains.The 81-year-old billionaire emphasised Oracle’s role in the artificial intelligence boom, declaring during an earnings call, “AI changes everything.”The company projected that its cloud infrastructure revenue would jump 77 per cent to $18 billion this fiscal year, with forecasts climbing to $144 billion within four years.Ellison said Oracle would profit not only from powering AI development but also from running day-to-day AI systems, from drug research and factory automation to financial trading and legal work.Investors rallied behind this vision, sending Oracle’s stock to $328.33 by close, valuing the firm at nearly $922 billion.Musk, who has held the world’s richest title since 2021, remains heavily reliant on Tesla’s performance. But shares of the electric carmaker have fallen 14 per cent this year amid weak demand and political controversies surrounding Musk.Tesla sales plunged 40 per cent in the European Union earlier this summer, marking the seventh consecutive monthly decline, while US market share also slipped.Though Musk has tried to redirect investor focus toward Tesla’s robotics and AI divisions, scepticism remains. Tesla shares closed Wednesday at $347.79, up less than 1 per cent, far behind Oracle’s dramatic rally.","Ellison, who owns more than 40 per cent of Oracle, saw his fortune swell by nearly $100 billion within half an hour of markets opening.

When Larry Ellison overtook Elon Musk as world’s richest

Ellison's 40% ownership in Oracle resulted in his wealth increasing by $100 billion within thirty minutes of market opening!





Larry Ellison, Oracle’s Chief Technology Officer, overtook Elon Musk to become the world’s richest person on Wednesday - albeit temporarily.The current wealth gap between these titans stands at a relatively modest one billion pounds, considering their enormous net worth: Musk maintains $384.2 billion whilst Ellison holds $383.2 billion.In the initial minutes of trading, Oracle Corp.'s share price increased dramatically, momentarily elevating its co-founder Ellison above the long-standing leader Elon Musk in the world’s wealthiest persons rankings.However, the volatile nature of the stock market restored Musk to the position of the world’s richest person by day's end, according to Bloomberg, as Oracle's shares settled lower than their earlier peak.At Wednesday's close, Oracle shares rose 36% to $328.33, whilst Tesla showed minimal movement, increasing less than 1% to $347.79.The temporary shift in rankings occurred following Oracle's exceptional earnings report, which highlighted substantial customer orders amidst increasing competition in artificial intelligence technology.Larry Ellison ascended to become the wealthiest individual globally, surpassing Elon Musk, who had held this position since four years prior. Musk's position was primarily attributed to his ownership in Tesla, an electric vehicle manufacturer that is currently experiencing a decline.Tesla's shares have declined by 14% in the current year, displaying a contrasting trajectory to Oracle's performance. Musk maintains control over numerous private enterprises, including the spacecraft manufacturer SpaceX, his AI venture xAI, and X (previously known as Twitter).The previous evening, post market closure, Oracle disclosed securing contracts exceeding $300 billion, including agreements with ""OpenAI, Meta, Nvidia and Musk's xAI"". The company projected its cloud infrastructure revenue to increase by 77% to $18 billion this fiscal year, followed by an anticipated rise to $144 billion over the subsequent four-year period.Ellison said in an earnings discussion how the company would generate revenue not only from AI development infrastructure but also from operating AI systems across various sectors, including manufacturing, pharmaceutical research, financial trading, and business automation.The substantial increase in Ellison's wealth on Wednesday morning reflected market confidence in automation replacing human workforce, positioning Oracle to capitalise on this transformation.""AI Changes Everything,"" declared the 81-year-old during the discussion.Meanwhile, Tesla's chief executive faces challenges in persuading investors despite similar aspirations. Following a significant decline in electric vehicle sales early this year, the anticipated recovery hasn't materialised. He has attempted to redirect attention towards Tesla's robotics division and AI developments in autonomous vehicles.Despite his continued optimism about Tesla's prospects, difficulties persist. The company experienced a 40% decline in European Union sales during early summer, marking seven consecutive months of reduction, partly due to his social media support for far-right politicians. US market share has also declined as customers responded negatively to his alignment with Donald Trump.","Ellison's 40% ownership in Oracle resulted in his wealth increasing by $100 billion within thirty minutes of market opening.

South Koreans Lay Siege To U.S. Embassy In Seoul Over Humiliating ICE Hyundai Raid





South Korean President Lee Jae Myung on Thursday warned that a large-scale US immigration raid at a Hyundai-LG battery plant under construction could have serious repercussions on future South Korean investments in America.The operation in Georgia, which saw hundreds of South Korean workers chained and handcuffed, was “bewildering” and “could have a significant impact on future investment decisions, particularly when evaluating the feasibility of direct operations in the US,” Lee said, according to news agency AFP.He also mentioned that South Korean businesses will face difficulties in keeping direct investments in the United States if the visa system for Korean workers does not see improvements.President Lee Jae Myung addressed the situation during a press conference, discussing the detention of South Korean workers following the immigration raid on Hyundai’s extensive auto plant in Georgia.US officials described the raid on September 4 as the largest single-site enforcement action in American history. Nearly 475 workers, more than 300 of them South Korean nationals, were detained during the Homeland Security-led operation at Hyundai’s sprawling complex west of Savannah.Video released by US authorities showed some workers shackled at their hands, ankles and waists, a move that shocked South Koreans and fuelled a sense of betrayal.Seoul dispatched a charter plane to Atlanta this week to bring back the detained workers.However, its return was delayed before the South Korean foreign ministry confirmed that the flight would depart on Thursday.Confirming their return, President Lee said, ""They are scheduled to depart the detention facility at 3 pm Seoul time (0600 GMT) today.""Negotiations with Washington have led to the release of workers under “voluntary” departures rather than deportations, which would have barred them from re-entering the US for up to a decade, according to news agency AP.The raid has come at a sensitive time. Only 11 days before, Lee had met US President Donald Trump in Washington, pledging an additional $150 billion investment in the US, following a July promise of $350 billion linked to tariff negotiations.During his Washington visit on Wednesday, South Korean foreign minister Cho Hyun raised the matter with US secretary of state Marco Rubio, saying that the images of detained workers had caused “big pains and shocks” in South Korea. He called for assurances that the workers would be able to leave without handcuffs and without future re-entry problems, as per AP.Trump defended the raid, saying the workers “were here illegally” and that the US must train its own citizens for specialised roles in industries such as batteries and semiconductors.","South Korean President Lee Jae Myung warned that a large-scale US immigration raid could have serious repercussions on future South Korean investments in America.

Why EU may not hike tariffs on India, China





US President Donald Trump has reportedly urged the European Union to impose 100% tariffs on countries like India and China for their Russian oil purchases, but the EU may not go ahead with the move.According to a Reuters report quoting EU sources, the European Union has indicated it would likely not implement severe tariffs on India or China, the primary purchasers of Russian oil, despite recommendations from Trump.A delegation from the EU, with the bloc's Russia sanctions head amongst them, travelled to Washington for discussions on aligning sanctions strategies against Russia following its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.Also Read | India-US trade deal: Should India be enthralled by Donald Trump’s outreach to PM Modi? According to officials, Trump suggested the EU should implement tariffs of up to 100% on India and China to exert pressure on Russian President Vladimir Putin, whose nation depends on energy sales to finance its military operations in Ukraine.The EU has levied comprehensive sanctions against Russia and has included two banks from China and a prominent Indian refinery in its latest sanctions package released in July.According to the Reuters report, the European Union handles tariffs distinctly from sanctions. Tariffs are implemented only after conducting thorough investigations, which typically extend over several months, to establish legally valid grounds.To date, the EU's tariff impositions related to the Ukraine conflict have been limited to fertilisers and agricultural products from Russia and Belarus. These measures were justified on grounds of preventing strategic dependence that could be exploited, whilst protecting EU-based fertiliser manufacturers from potential harm.An EU diplomat told Reuters confirmed that discussions regarding potential tariffs haven't been initiated with either India or China.“So far, there is no discussion on possible tariffs neither on India...nor with China,"" an EU diplomat was quoted as saying.Also Read | The 50% misfire: How Trump made Russian oil cheaper for India - And Putin a winner The European Union is currently working towards completing a trade agreement with India, and they are cautious about actions that might compromise this negotiation.By Wednesday, Trump's stance towards India showed signs of softening, as he expressed interest in rebuilding trade relationships with New Delhi.A second EU source quoted in the report highlighted the risks associated with broad tariffs, suggesting that targeting specific entities would be more effective, with the option to remove sanctions if they stop Russian business operations.Until now, the European Union's sanctions have primarily targeted lesser-known entities in third countries, specifically shell companies that facilitate the transfer of military equipment or dual-use goods to Russia's military sector.The EU's 19th sanctions package, potentially to be proposed on Friday, aims to include banks from two central Asian nations and Chinese refineries.Also Read | Pushing back against Trump pressure: India’s state-owned refiners look to fully revive Russia crude oil buys; lack of cargoes an issue","US President Donald Trump has reportedly urged the European Union to impose 100% tariffs on countries like India and China for their Russian oil purchases.

Klarna IPO debut: Stock jumps 30% on NYSE listing; Swedish BNPL firm eyes US market growth,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/klarna-ipo-debut-stock-jumps-30-on-nyse-listing-swedish-bnpl-firm-eyes-us-market-growth/articleshow/123814628.cms,"



Shares of Swedish buy-now-pay-later company Klarna surged 30% in their much-anticipated public debut on the New York Stock Exchange, opening at $52 compared to the IPO price of $40 set late Tuesday.More than 34 million shares worth about $1.37 billion were sold, making it the largest IPO this year, according to Renaissance Capital. It took specialists on the NYSE floor nearly three-and-a-half hours to manually price the first batch of trades, AP reported.The listing comes in one of the busiest years for IPOs, alongside debuts from Figma and Circle Internet Group. Upcoming offerings include StubHub and Gemini, the crypto exchange majority owned by the Winklevoss twins.Founded in 2005, Klarna entered the US market in 2015 through a partnership with Macy’s. Today, it works with hundreds of thousands of merchants and has struck deals with Walmart and other retailers. Klarna will trade under the ticker “KLAR.”“It’s the largest consumer market in the world, and it’s the biggest credit card market in the world. It’s a tremendous opportunity, from our perspective,” CEO and co-founder Sebastian Siemiatkowski told the Associated Press ahead of the IPO.Klarna’s popular “pay-in-4” plan lets customers split purchases into four instalments over six weeks. The company also offers longer-term loans with interest, attracting over 111 million users worldwide. Regulators, however, have flagged risks of consumers overextending themselves, similar to credit card debt.Siemiatkowski said Klarna actively monitors consumer behaviour and noted the average user balance is under $100. With its short-term lending model, the company said it can quickly adjust underwriting standards if economic conditions shift.The IPO has minted billionaires among Klarna’s founders. At $40 a share, Siemiatkowski’s 7% stake is worth about $1 billion, while co-founder Victor Jacobsson’s 8.4% stake is valued at $1.3 billion. Early investor Sequoia Capital holds 21% of the firm, worth roughly $3.15 billion, while Silver Lake owns 4.5%.Klarna reported second-quarter revenue of $823 million and adjusted profit of $29 million. Loan delinquency rates stand at 0.89% for short-term loans and 2.23% for longer-term loans, both below the average 30-day credit card delinquency rate.With its debut, Klarna becomes the second-largest BNPL company by market cap after Affirm, whose shares have risen over 40% this year to a valuation of $28 billion. Klarna’s IPO was underwritten by JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs.","More than 34 million shares worth about $1.37 billion were sold, making it the largest IPO this year.

Trump tariff shock: Fitch warns US economy is slowing down; says evidence visible in ‘hard’ economic data,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/trump-tariff-shock-fitch-warns-us-economy-is-slowing-down-says-evidence-visible-in-hard-economic-data/articleshow/123813917.cms,"GDP fluctuations caused by Donald Trump administration's tariff-related factors mask the actual economic deceleration. (AI image)

The final domestic sales figures (GDP without net trade and inventories) decreased to 1.6% annualised, down from the 2.5%-3.0% levels observed in 2023 and 2024.

Consumer spending growth declined to 1.6% annualised in 1H25, compared to 3% during 2023 and 2024.

Services expenditure has significantly decreased due to weakened consumer confidence and increased household savings.

Government expenditure on goods and services, which contributed 0.6pp to yearly GDP growth in both 2023 and 2024, has now reached a plateau.

Private investment patterns have shown variation, with equipment investment showing substantial growth, driven by increased AI-related capital expenditure, whilst investment in commercial and residential properties has decreased.

However, elevated long-term interest rates continue to affect property investment, and considering the heightened policy uncertainty, the overall investment outlook remains modest.

The employment landscape shows signs of slowing. The average monthly increase in payrolls reached only 29,000 during the three months leading to August, marking the lowest level since 2010 (barring the pandemic period). This trend reflects both diminishing labour availability and demand, particularly as restricted immigration policies affect population expansion.

Despite maintaining low unemployment figures, the combination of reduced job creation, steady wage moderation and increasing inflation will negatively impact overall real household earnings, and Fitch anticipates further reduction in consumption during the second half of 2025.

The rise in inflation is expected to reduce real wage increases and affect US consumer expenditure, which has already demonstrated significant slowdown in 2025. Employment expansion has significantly reduced, partially due to immigration restrictions affecting workforce growth. Despite anticipated support from an expanding fiscal deficit in 2026, Fitch projects that the US annual average GDP growth will remain at a subdued 1.6%, considerably lower than the typical trend.





The US economy is slowing down, a fact that is now evident in ‘hard’ data according to Fitch ratings’ latest Global Economic Outlook report. “The US economy is slowing down. Our growth forecasts for both 2025 and 2026 are broadly unchanged from the June GEO at 1.6%, but this represents a sharp deceleration from 2.8% in 2024,” Fitch says in its latest report.The US economy showed a 0.8% expansion (non-annualised) in 2Q25, surpassing Fitch’s June forecast of 0.4%, primarily due to reduced imports. However, the GDP fluctuations caused by Donald Trump administration's tariff-related factors mask the actual economic deceleration, cautions Fitch.“Greater clarity about US tariff hikes does not alter the fact that they are huge and will reduce global growth. And evidence of a slowdown in the US is now appearing in the hard data; it’s no longer just in the sentiment surveys,” said Brian Coulton, Chief Economist at Fitch.Also Read | Strong domestic demand: Fitch revises India’s GDP growth outlook upwards to 6.9%; expects another RBI rate cut this year Additional tax reductions included in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act are expected to expand the fiscal deficit, which should bolster demand in the coming year. From early 2026, Fitch expects quarterly GDP growth to improve, although the yearly average growth is projected to remain steady at 1.6%. Recent months have shown a slight increase in core inflation, with tariffs having a minimal impact on prices.“We anticipate a stronger pass-through in the rest of the year as pre-tariff imported inventories are depleted and more firms acknowledge that tariff hikes are here to stay. Nevertheless, we have lowered our end-year CPI forecast to 3.6% from 3.8% in the June GEO,” says Fitch.Also Read | ‘Modi’s war’?

But we expect pass-through to accelerate later this year,” it adds.The softening in the labour market will make the Fed more willing to ease policy and we now anticipate 25bp of rate cuts at both the September and December FOMC meetings and three further rate reductions in 2026, it concludes.","US economy showed a 0.8% expansion (non-annualised) in 2Q25, surpassing Fitch’s June forecast of 0.4%.

Who is Larry Ellison?

Why are Oracle shares soaring?

Larry Ellison’s investments





Larry Ellison has dethroned Elon Musk to become the world’s richest person with a net worth of $393 billion. Oracle’s Chief Technology Officer (CTO) saw his wealth increase by $101 billion as of 10:10 a.m. in New York, following Oracle Corp. 's exceptional quarterly performance, according to Bloomberg.The 81-year-old executive's net worth expanded significantly after Oracle Corp. presented an optimistic forecast for its cloud operations, resulting in a substantial rise in its share price.The Bloomberg Billionaires Index indicates that Ellison's wealth reached $393 billion, surpassing Musk's $385 billion, as recorded at 10:10 a.m. in New York. This single-day increase represents the highest gain ever documented by the index.Ellison's ownership of approximately 1.16 billion Oracle shares, which increased 40% to $338 on Wednesday morning, contributed to this wealth accumulation.The company's shares experienced a dramatic rise after Oracle announced an unexpectedly strong growth projection on Tuesday evening.Larry Ellison, a college dropout, went on to establish Oracle Corp.,which became one of the world's leading technology enterprises. In July this year, he surpassed Mark Zuckerberg to claim the position of second-richest person globally, and within two months, he has overtaken Elon Musk.His remarkable financial success has been paired with an extravagant lifestyle. His acquisitions include megayachts, private aircraft, prestigious properties and a Hawaiian island, according to a Bloomberg report.Larry Ellison serves as co-founder and principal shareholder of Oracle, a prominent software organisation renowned for its database system, which supports numerous major corporate operations worldwide. The company has recently achieved success in cloud computing infrastructure, a sector where Amazon.com Inc. maintains significant influence.At 81, Ellison maintains ownership of over 40% of Oracle, now based in Austin, Texas, which forms the primary component of his assets. His portfolio includes investments in Tesla Inc., a sailing organisation, the Indian Wells tennis tournament, and substantial property holdings, including Hawaii's Lanai island.Adopted at nine months old by his mother's aunt and uncle, Ellison grew up in Chicago's south side. After leaving studies at both the University of Illinois and the University of Chicago, he relocated to Berkeley, California. There, he secured employment at Ampex as a computer programmer, where he contributed to developing a database called Oracle for the Central Intelligence Agency.In 1977, Ellison, along with two partners, established the company that would later become Oracle. The company went public on March 12, 1986, just one day before Microsoft Corp.'s IPO. After serving as Oracle's chief executive officer until September 2014, he transitioned to the roles of chairman and chief technology officer.Oracle's current surge in prominence stems from its substantial investments in cloud infrastructure services, providing internet-based computing and storage capabilities. The company's market position has strengthened considerably due to the growing demand from AI companies and startups seeking additional computing capacity.Oracle's shares experienced remarkable growth, with values tripling since ChatGPT's public debut in November 2022.The company's success continued with significant achievements earlier in the year. A notable milestone occurred when Oracle secured a substantial 4.5-gigawatt data centre capacity agreement with OpenAI, ChatGPT's operator, in July.The company's client portfolio includes prominent tech firms like Nvidia Corp. and ByteDance Ltd.'s TikTok. These developments position Oracle as a significant competitor to established cloud service providers Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet Inc.'s Google.The company's standing has been enhanced by Ellison's connections with US President Donald Trump, the Bloomberg report said. As a long-term Republican donor and Trump supporter, Ellison has seen Oracle receive increased recognition since Trump's return to office in January.Oracle participates in the $500 billion Stargate AI infrastructure initiative, announced by Trump in January. The administration supports Oracle's potential acquisition of TikTok's US operations, which would grant Oracle ownership in a globally popular consumer platform. While Trump endorses Oracle's joint bid for ByteDance's video application, Chinese authorities have yet to approve the transaction.According to Bloomberg, Ellison has invested extensively in luxury properties across the United States over the last ten years. His portfolio includes residences in Malibu and Rancho Mirage, California, the historic Beechwood Mansion in Newport, Rhode Island, and a Japanese-influenced estate in the San Francisco Bay Area.As a significant Tesla investor, Ellison held approximately 1.5% ownership according to the company's 2022 proxy statement. Following his departure from Tesla's board in June 2022, his current shareholding remains undisclosed. He was also a substantial supporter of Musk's acquisition of Twitter, now known as X.The Oracle founder's lifestyle choices reflect his considerable wealth. A 2002 communication from his accountant, referenced in a January 2006 San Francisco Chronicle article, advised him to exercise more financial restraint. Ellison maintains his standard of living through a combination of debt financing and proceeds from Oracle shares and dividends, which have exceeded $12 billion since 2003, based on Bloomberg's data analysis.","The 81-year-old executive's net worth expanded significantly after Oracle Corp. presented an optimistic forecast for its cloud operations, resulting in a substantial rise in its share price.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.","Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor (CEA) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas.

How India's GDP has been growing

What SBI report said on savings and investment

Incremental capital output ratio

NEW DELHI: India's gross domestic product (GDP) data for the third quarter (October-December 2022) received a word of caution from the former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan In an interview with news agency PTI, Rajan that India is ""dangerously close"" to the Hindu rate of growth in view of subdued private sector investment, high interest rates and slowing global growth.India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying"".However, a report released by the State Bank of India (SBI) economists on Tuesday dismissed arguments that India is dangerously close to Hindu rate of growth saying such statements are ""ill-conceived, biased and premature"".The term 'Hindu growth rate' was coined by late economist Raj Krishna in 1978 to describe the slow growth in the country.It basically refers to the low pace of economic growth rates during 1950s to 1980s. During this period, the Indian economy averaged 3.5%.A former lecturer at the Delhi School of Economics (DSE), Krishna noted that only if the rate of growth is persistently slow and accompanied by low per-capita GDP, then it will be known as Hindu rate of growth but it has to factor in population growth as well.Before economic reforms of 1991, India's economic growth remained stagnant and low, while per capita income averaged around 1.3%.Krishna termed this low growth situation to be a result of socialist policies of state control and import substitution.However, the economic situation changed when liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation (LPG) reforms came into effect in the year 1991, at a time when India faced balance of payment crisis.Over the years, many economists have strongly opposed the idea of 'Hindu growth rate' and the term never had universal acceptance.The Indian economy plunged into its very first technical recession in FY21 due to the impact of Covid-19 pandemic and the related nationwide lockdowns. GDP shrunk by an unprecedented 23.8% in the first quarter of the financial year 2020-21. However, due to spurt in economic activities in the subsequent quarters, the GDP decline started to narrow.However, if we look at the period before Covid-19 as well, India's growth curve shows a declining trend.From 8.26% in FY17, GDP growth plunged to 3.74% in FY20. Shutdown of economic activities in FY21 in wake of Covid-19 only made matters worse.As lockdowns started to ease and business activities resumed, India's GDP also started rising. In Q1 of FY22, growth jumped to 20.1% mainly on account of low base effect. By the fourth quarter of FY22, growth came down to 4.10%.Similarly, the new financial year 2022-23 brought fresh economic challenges in the form of Russia-Ukraine war that impacted almost all major economies of the world, slowed the pace of growth, pushed inflation to record highs.As a result, the central banks of all advanced economies spurred into action and opted for monetary policy tightening to curb the soaring inflation.With persistently rising interest rates, India's economy grew by 4.4% in Q3 of FY23, as the Centre revised upwards GDP growth for previous year to 9.10% from 8.7% earlier.The report weighed recent GDP numbers against the available data on savings and investments for the past decade and highlighted some interesting points.""Quarterly growth numbers are noisy and should be best avoided for any serious interpretation (on an average, India's GDP growth has witnessed Rs 2 lakh crore upward revision for the 3 year ended FY23),"" the report said.Gross capital formation (GCF) by the government touched a high of 11.8% in 2021-22, up from 10.7% in 2020-21.""This also had a domino effect on private sector investment that jumped from 10 per cent to 10.8% over the same period,"" it said.In fact, Ecowrap added that the trends in GCF to gross output ratio or the plough back of funds for creation of fresh capacity shows that for public administration the ratio attained fresh peak in 2021-22 owing to the emphasis on capital expenditure in recent budgets.At the aggregate level, gross capital formation is supposed to have crossed 32% in 2022-23, the highest level since 2018-19.According to the report, in 2021-22, gross savings have risen to 30% from 29% in 2020-21.""The ratio is supposed to have crossed 31 per cent in 2022-23, the highest since 2018-19. The household savings increased sharply during the pandemic period on account of sharp accretion in financial savings such as deposits,"" said the report by SBI's Economic Research Department.While household financial savings have since then moderated from 15.4% in 2020-21 to 11.1% in 2022-23, savings in physical assets have grown sharply to 11.8% in 2021-22 from 10.7% in 2020-21.The report further analysed Incremental Capital Output ratio (ICOR) -- which measures additional units of capital (investment) needed to produce additional units of output. It said that the ratio has been improving.""ICOR which was 7.5 in FY 12 is now only 3.5 in FY22. Clearly, only half of capital is now needed for next unit of output,"" the report noted.Such reducing ICOR in the current years reflects a relatively increasing efficiency of capital and shows that the economy is on a sound footing, the report said.""From that point of view, future GDP growth rates even at 7% could still mean a decent number by any standards!,"" it added.","India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter.

An employee is entitled for a 50 per cent amount of the last drawn salary as pension.OPS was discontinued by the NDA government in 2003 with effect from April 1, 2004.Under the new pension scheme (NPS), employees contribute 10 per cent of their basic salary towards pension while the government contributes 14 per cent.Governments of Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand have informed the central government/ Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA about their decision to restart OPS for their employees.The government of Punjab on November 18, 2022, issued a notification regarding implementation of OPS for the state government employees who are being covered under NPS. Jharkhand too has decided to revert to OPS.",Former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan has expressed his concern over the decision of some states to restart the old pension scheme.

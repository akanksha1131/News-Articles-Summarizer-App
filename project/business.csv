Rupee opened in green on Friday, climbing 9 paise to 90.25 against the US dollar, as currency markets reacted to optimism around the India-US trade deal but remained cautious ahead of the Reserve Bank of India’s monetary policy announcement.The early gains came after the currency ended Thursday’s session higher by 13 paise at 90.34 against the greenback. According to forex traders, while sentiment has improved, rupee’s movement continues to be constrained by strong corporate demand for dollars and weakness in domestic equities. Market participants are also said to be shifting from initial optimism to scrutiny, as neither India nor the US has released formal documents outlining the agreement.On Thursday, rupee opened at 90.52 in the interbank foreign exchange market, moved to an intraday high of 90.06 and a low of 90.53, before settling at 90.34, marking a gain of 13 paise over the previous close.Attention is also on the Reserve Bank of India, where the six-member Monetary Policy Committee led by Governor Sanjay Malhotra began deliberations on Wednesday. The policy decision will be announced on Friday morning.Experts said the RBI has already cut the repo rate by 125 basis points since last February and may maintain a pause, although some believe another rate cut remains possible to further lower borrowing costs.Meanwhile on the stock market front, equity benchmarks opened on a subdued note on Friday, slipping into negative territory as investors adopted a wait-and-watch approach ahead of MPC decision.At the opening bell, the Nifty 50 fell 37 points, or 0.14%, to 25,605.80, while the BSE Sensex edged down 64.61 points, or 0.08%, to 83,249.32.

$2 trillion wiped off crypto markets!

Bitcoin wipes out gains since Trump’s election

Broader digital asset holdings also hit

Fed concerns and investor outflows

Tech sector weakness piles pressure on crypto segment

Cryptogiant Bitcoin has suffered sharp losses since the beginning of 2026, tumbling over 20%. The digital currency has given up almost half of its value since October’s record peak of over $124,000, sliding to $67,000, now worth less than it was at the start of President Donald Trump’s second term. Bitcoin is often pitched as “digital gold” as its returns are just like gold, offering no dividends or profits and price driven by what investors are willing to pay. The world’s largest cryptocurrency was last trading 1.64% higher at $64,153.24 after a volatile session that saw prices swing between gains and losses, having earlier touched a low of $60,008.52.The global crypto market has lost $2 trillion in value since peaking at $4.379 trillion in early October, with $800 billion wiped out in the last month alone, Reuters reported. Bitcoin has declined 28% so far this year, while ether has lost nearly 38% over the same period.As the asset slid, shares of companies holding bitcoin and other digital assets also came under heavy pressure amid ongoing turbulence in the cryptocurrency market, fuelling concerns about stress across the sector. Publicly listed firms that piled into crypto last year, encouraged by US President Donald Trump’s supportive stance, are now grappling with intensifying market challenges.The decline comes as uncertainty over Federal Reserve rate cuts and concerns over AI company valuations weigh on risk assets, pushing bitcoin to its lowest level since November 2024.MicroStrategy’s bitcoin-focused arm, Strategy, has seen shares tumble from $457 in July to $111.27 on Thursday, marking their lowest level since August 2024. The stock was last down more than 11%, according to Reuters.In December, Strategy cut its 2025 earnings forecast, citing weak bitcoin performance, and announced plans to create a reserve to support dividend payments. The company now expects full-year earnings between a $6.3 billion profit and a $5.5 billion loss, down from its earlier forecast of $24 billion.Other notable bitcoin buyers have also been hit. UK-based Smarter Web Company (SWC.L) fell nearly 18%, Nakamoto Inc (NAKA.O) lost almost 9%, and Japan’s Metaplanet (3350.T) dropped over 7%.Bitcoin itself is down nearly 28% since the start of the year, with recent selling accelerating after Trump nominated Kevin Warsh as the next Federal Reserve chair. Analysts cited by Reuters say that Warsh’s appointment could lead to a smaller Fed balance sheet, a negative for speculative assets like crypto.Bitcoin has erased all gains made since Trump’s election, when he pledged to overhaul policies toward digital assets. The cryptocurrency last traded at $67,651.“As Bitcoin continues its slide below the psychological barrier of $70,000, it’s clear the crypto market is now in full capitulation mode,"" said Nic Puckrin, investment analyst and co-founder of Coin Bureau. ""If previous cycles are anything to go by, this is no longer a short-term correction, but rather a transition... and these typically take months, not weeks,"" Reuters cited the expert.Companies holding other tokens have been affected as well. Alt5 Sigma, which stocks the Trump family’s WLFI token, fell 8.4%. SharpLink Gaming, holding ether, dropped 8%, while Forward Industries, which holds solana, fell nearly 6%.Bitcoin fell to a low of $63,295.74 on Thursday, its weakest since October 2024, before rebounding slightly to $63,525, marking its largest one-day drop since November 2022. Approximately $1 billion in bitcoin positions were liquidated over 24 hours, according to CoinGlass data.Trump’s Fed pick, Kevin Warsh, has added to market fears. Analysts say investors worry that a smaller balance sheet will remove liquidity support for speculative assets.""The market fears a hawk with him,"" Manuel Villegas Franceschi from Julius Baer told Reuters. ""A smaller balance sheet is not going to provide any tailwinds for crypto.""Deutsche Bank analysts highlighted massive outflows from institutional ETFs as a key driver of the decline.US spot bitcoin ETFs saw over $3 billion withdrawn in January, following $2 billion and $7 billion outflows in December and November, respectively. ""This steady selling in our view signals that traditional investors are losing interest, and overall pessimism about crypto is growing,"" they said.The slide in cryptocurrencies has been compounded by a broader downturn in tech stocks, particularly software companies linked to AI. Bitcoin and other tokens have historically tracked risk appetite in technology markets, and the current weakness has intensified losses.""Concerns are being raised around the crypto miners and whether we could be looking at forced liquidations if prices continue to fall, which could lead to a vicious cycle,"" said Jefferies strategist Mohit Kumar, as cited by Reuters. The analyst further added that crypto “should never be more than a very small portion of a portfolio, but its heavy retail ownership adds to overall market risk.""","Global crypto market has lost $2 trillion in value since peaking at $4.379 trillion in early October, with $800 billion wiped out in the last month alone.

Gold and silver price prediction: Gold and silver prices have resumed their upward momentum after the recent crash, signalling bullish momentum, says Abhilash Koikkara, Head - Forex & Commodities, Nuvama Professional Clients Group. He shares his views on gold and silver:MCX Gold on the weekly timeframe has undergone a correction from its all-time high of 180,779. However, prices have found support at the rising trendline and have rebounded, indicating a resumption of the bullish trend. The recent acceleration reinforces the strength and sustainability of the move, and the broader outlook remains positive as long as prices hold above the weekly low.From a weekly standpoint, the 147,000 region stands out as a crucial support, aligned with the 30-days exponential moving average. Any pullback toward this zone is expected to draw fresh buying interest, helping to limit downside risk in the near term. Sustaining above this level keeps the bullish structure intact and supports ongoing positive momentum.Gold looks well positioned to move toward the 175,000 mark in the coming sessions, and a decisive close above this level would validate the bullish bias for subsequent periods.This potential upside aligns with the broader uptrend and highlights the strength of prevailing momentum. Moreover, the formation of higher highs and higher lows over the week further supports positive sentiment and points to the likelihood of a sustained upward move.Overall, gold continues to exhibit a positive bias, with the broader technical structure clearly supporting trend continuation. As long as prices stay comfortably above the key 147,000 support level, the bullish setup remains valid. Backed by strong momentum indicators and a supportive market sentiment environment, the metal appears well placed to carry its upward move forward in the coming sessions.MCX Silver has seen a healthy pullback from its all-time high of 420,048 and has since rebounded from recent lows, signalling a resumption of the bullish trend. With the underlying trend still positive, any ongoing dips may be viewed as buying opportunities as long as the latest weekly low holds. We advise aligning positions with the prevailing uptrend, while maintaining a controlled stop-loss at the recent weekly lows.Silver’s rally at the start of the week signals a renewed bullish trend and strengthens the outlook for further upside. As long as prices remain above the weekly support levels, the positive bias is expected to persist. Immediate key support is seen around the 245,000 zone, and a close below this level could weaken the bullish outlook. Until then, any pullback is likely to attract fresh buying interest, sustaining upward momentum.On the upside, silver appears well positioned to test the 330,000 resistance over the near to medium term. This prospective move points to a continuation of the prevailing bullish phase, backed by strong momentum and favourable technical indicators. Overall, provided prices remain firmly above the 245,000 support level, silver is expected to sustain its uptrend, with ample scope for further appreciation as bullish sentiment continues to strengthen.","Gold and silver prices have resumed their upward momentum after the recent crash, says Abhilash Koikkara, Head - Forex & Commodities, Nuvama Professional Clients Group.

The Washington Post's publisher and CEO Will Lewis resigned on Saturday, just days after laying off 300 journalists. His sudden departure comes amid strong criticism from staff over his handling of the newspaper's financial troubles and recent mass layoffs. Jeff D'Onofrio, the company's CFO, will take over as acting publisher and CEO immediately.Lewis announced his exit in a brief note to staff, thanking owner Jeff Bezos and claiming the ""difficult decisions"" were needed for the Post's future. “After two years of transformation at The Washington Post, now is the right time for me to step aside,” Lewis wrote Saturday in a brief note to staff. “I want to thank Jeff Bezos for his support and leadership throughout my tenure as CEO and Publisher. The institution could not have a better owner,"" he added.Further continuing his message he added, “During my tenure, difficult decisions have been taken in order to ensure the sustainable future of The Post so it can for many years ahead publish high-quality nonpartisan news to millions of customers each day.""However, Lewis' leadership came with controversies, according to CNN. Even during the Wednesday layoffs, his absence and subsequent appearance at a Super Bowl event in San Francisco reportedly caused anger.The Washington Post announced what it called a “significant restructuring” of its operations, including the closure of its standalone Sports desk and a reduction in its international reporting presence. According to Fox News, roughly a third of the organisation’s workforce which is nearly 300 employees were affected.Bezos broke his silence since the layoffs, stating in a statement that ""The Post has an essential journalistic mission and an extraordinary opportunity."" He expressed confidence in the new leadership team of D'Onofrio, executive editor Matt Murray, and Opinion editor Adam O'Neal.Lewis's 15-month tenure was rocky from the start. He joined in November 2023 after working at The Wall Street Journal and within Rupert Murdoch's media empire. His reputation took hits when NPR reported his alleged involvement in covering up a phone-hacking scandal at Murdoch's UK tabloids, which he denied. He also reportedly tried to stop NPR from publishing that story.The Washington Post Guild responded to Lewis's departure with sharp criticism. ""His legacy will be the attempted destruction of a great American journalism institution,"" the union said, calling on Bezos to reverse the layoffs or sell the paper to someone willing to invest in its future.Despite attempts to improve the Post's business side and develop new revenue streams, Lewis struggled to win over the newsroom. His decision to fire executive editor Sally Buzbee and his handling of the recent layoffs, where he was notably absent from communicating with staff, further damaged his standing with employees.","The Washington Post's publisher and CEO Will Lewis resigned on Saturday.

Shivraj Singh Chouhan Big Claim On India-US Trade Deal

NEW DELHI: Ending months of uncertainty, India and US announced the finalisation of the first tranche of the trade deal early Saturday that will see Washington lower ""reciprocal tariffs"" on Indian exports to 18% over the next few days and New Delhi slash levies on several American imports.The India-US joint statement came with US President Donald Trump scrapping the 25% penalty on Indian exports for Russian oil purchases, a move that overnight makes made-in-India products, including those in the high seas, competitive in the American market. Labour-intensive sectors with significant MSME presence, textiles, leather and footwear and marine products, are expected to be big beneficiaries as they were facing strong headwinds due to the punishing 50% additional tariffs, which will now drop to 18% over the product-specific or MFN tariff that applies to all countries.Commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal told reporters that India has opted for calibrated opening up, allowing American imports in areas where there were requirements, while protecting sensitivities in key segments such as agricultural and dairy products, including cereals, corn, sugar, soybean, genetically modified (GM) food products and fuel ethanol.While sensitive farm goods were the sticking point, India has sought to work out an arrangement where products such as apples and cotton long staple fibre will enter India at lower duty, but in specified quantities. Import duties will be slashed for pistachios, walnuts, almonds, soybean oil and some lentils, wines and whiskey as well as dried distillers' grains and red sorghum for animal feed. In return, several Indian foods products, including bananas, guava, spices, tea, coffee and processed food items, will also get zero-duty access in US.","US President Donald Trump scrapping the 25% penalty on Indian exports for Russian oil purchases.

India-US Trade Deal Explained: What The White House Says On Tariffs, Markets And Tech Shifts

NEW DELHI: Keen for a bigger pie of the world's fastest growing aviation market, the biggest sectoral original equipment manufacturers' legal teams are poring over the fine print of the landmark Indo-US trade deal.A zero-duty access to components exported from India to the US will give India parity with other aerospace supply chains such as Europe, Japan and Korea.While clarity is expected in a week or so, zero duty will mean an ""exponential"" increase in aerospace exports from India, which is currently pegged at $1.5 billion annually for Airbus and $1.25 billion for Boeing. Officials said Boeing has indicated it will double the sourcing of components from India, with commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal asserting that India will be one of the largest foreign component suppliers in the coming years.A tariff cut from 50% to 18% also will mean significant relief for the growing aerospace supply chain. It could also translate into large orders for American giants such as Boeing, which already has orders worth $50 billion for hundreds of wide-body and narrow-body planes from Air India Group and Akasa.Sources said that IndiGo is expected to place a mega order for wide-body aircraft which Boeing is eyeing closely. Boeing alone expects orders worth ""tens of billions"" from India in a not-so-distant future.Boeing India and South Asia president Salil Gupte told TOI: ""The US-India trade agreement opens up multifold opportunities, and we are excited by its potential to accelerate bilateral trade and economic relations between the two countries.""Govt officials said Indian carriers led by AI and IndiGo are likely to place orders for $70-80 billion worth of aircraft, engines and spares.

NEW DELHI: Among the key terms of the India-US joint statement is both sides' agreeing to strengthen economic security alignment to enhance supply chain resilience and innovation through complementary actions, addressing ""non-market policies of third parties, as well as cooperation on inbound and outbound investment reviews and export controls"".The tacit ""non-market"" reference to China has been used by the US, EU and G7 countries to draw attention to China's economic model driven by overcapacity, export restrictions, state-owned dominance and industrial subsidies. With the joint statement, both countries are also signalling they will synchronise their strategies for derisking or reducing China's global dominance in manufacturing in areas like semiconductors and green energy.At the critical minerals meeting hosted by the US this week, external affairs minister S Jaishankar spoke about the challenges arising out of excessive concentration and the importance of de-risking supply chains through structured international cooperation. The statement also builds upon commitment made by both sides, during PM Modi's visit to the US last year, as part of TRUST (Transforming the Relationship Utilising Strategic Technology) initiative, to build trusted and resilient supply chains.The fact that both sides are willing to work together to counter Chinese economic influence is a positive signal for India, especially at a time Trump appears circumspect in his commitment to the Indo-Pacific. An early Quad summit with Trump visiting host India can help quell that perception. With the India-US trade differences resolved at least for now, not just India but also Australia and Japan would like the summit to take place without further delay.","Both sides agree to strengthen economic security alignment to enhance supply chain resilience and innovation through complementary actions.

India-US Trade Deal Explained: What The White House Says On Tariffs, Markets And Tech Shifts

NEW DELHI: US giants Harley Davidson, Jeep and Tesla are the likely big winners of the trade deal with govt offering concessions, without upsetting domestic industry.For Harley Davidson, Donald Trump has won concessions which his predecessors couldn't get: Zero duty access for 800-1,600cc bikes. Tariffs will go down from the day the framework agreement are implemented, those familiar with the decision said. ""The concessions are only for Harley Davidson bikes and not for others,"" an official said. There are also concessions for large cars and EVs, a move that may benefit Elon Musk's Tesla, although full details are currently unavailable. What is currently known is that a specified number of vehicles with over 3,000cc engine capacity will see duty reduced from 110% to 50%. Over next 10 years it will come down to zero. With Ford and GM leaving the Indian market, it is only Jeep that stands to benefit at the moment.""The deal is a positive step and, once the finer details are in place, it opens up a wide range of opportunities for brands like Jeep. We have a strong portfolio with products positioned above Compass and Meridian, and we are evaluating how these could fit into the Indian market. We are also looking to explore possibilities of exports from India as reduced trade barriers will help enhance manufacturing competitiveness, expand export potential and support seamless integration of our India operations into global supply chains.This creates the possibility of introducing advanced technologies and select global offerings for Indian customers, while we continue to evaluate opportunities in a calibrated manner,"" said Shailesh Hazela, MD & CEO, Stellantis India, which has Jeep and Citroen in its portfolio.An industry executive said the volumes in these segments are unlikely to be large. ""When it comes to bikes, there is no clash with any of the Indian players. BMW and Honda have bikes in the segment that Harley Davidson operates in, but the volumes are low. Similarly, when it comes to cars over 3,000cc, none of the Indian manufacturers is in that segment and the volumes for Mercedes, BMW, Volkswagen and Skoda are low,"" the executive said.","US giants Harley Davidson, Jeep and Tesla are the likely big winners of the trade deal.

India-US Trade Deal Explained: What The White House Says On Tariffs, Markets And Tech Shifts

NEW DELHI: Duty concessions to American whiskey and wine are unlikely to have any major impact on Indian companies. To begin with, it will come with a minimum import price which was the case with Australian, European and the UK trade deals. Besides, the volumes are very low, reports Sidhartha.For instance, with total sales of 2,29,000 cases of nine-litre bottles, American whiskey accounted for less than 0.1% share of the Indian whiskey market, dominated by Indian players. Scotch (over 3%) and Irish (under 0.2%) have a bigger share of the pie.""Most Bourbons and Tennessee whiskies have distinct darkish colour and stronger flavours, which like single malt whiskies, appeal to a more discerning palette and less so to the majority of premium whiskey consumers. Pricing is not the main barrier to consumer adoption, as has been evidenced by the very modest performance of bottled in India Jim Beam that retails at a very affordable price below locally bottled Scotch whiskey. So, duty reduction on Bourbon will not make any big impact on the premium whiskey market,"" said Brewers Association of India director general Vinod Giri, an industry veteran.The industry is awaiting details of the deal, with govt officials assuring that interests of domestic players will not be adversely impacted.""CIABC believes that the bilateral trade deal will be equitable and mutually beneficial for both countries. CIABC is not against reduction in import duty, but wants it in a phased manner,"" said Confederation of Indian Alcoholic Beverages Companies DG Anant S Iyer.When it comes to wine, the segment's share was less than 0.5% of the Indian alcohol market, and within that, Australian is the largest. ""Success in the Indian wine market, especially imported wines, is driven not just by provenance, but by ability to distribute effectively,"" said Giri.","Duty concessions to American whiskey and wine are unlikely to have any major impact on Indian companies.

NEW DELHI: Until a couple of months ago, a trade deal with the US did not seem to be on the horizon. India refused to back Donald Trump's claim of having brokered the pause of Operation Sindoor and the Trump administration persisted with its crude fulminations against India's tariffs. US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick seemed to be bang on when he, in a podcast, described the prospect of an early deal by saying that ""the train had left the station"".Given the backdrop, the framework for an interim agreement between the two countries as precursor to a Bilateral Trade Agreement appears to be a dramatic breakthrough with positive spin-offs for the entire gamut of bilateral ties. India stands on a better footing vis-a-vis not just its competitors like Indonesia, Bangladesh and Vietnam, but also in comparison with Pakistan, which has quickly cast itself as an ally of the US. While the lowering of tariff will especially help those engaged in MSME sector and labour-intensive sectors of apparels, leather and marine products, the embarrassment that Pakistan ought to be feeling over its premature celebrations comes as the sweetener.Those who negotiated behind the scenes, without getting distracted by the bellicose remarks of the likes of Peter Navarro, senior US trade counsellor and a Trump confidant, managed to fend off pressure from the US for letting in corn, soybean, genetically modified crops.The states in the US which produce most of these commodities also happen to be home to Trump's ardent MAGA constituency.With the US mid-term polls approaching and the US president's newly acquired constituencies threatening to slip away, pressure on him to please the base must have been acute.The success of Indian negotiators will also help govt insulate the deal against ""surrender"" jibes. Opposition parties criticised the announcement, nonetheless, and on Monday, Parliament is set to see commotion over the alleged sellout. The argument is based on reduction of tariff on dried distillers' grains (DDGs) and red sorghum for animal feed, which are not the same currency, politically or economically, as cereals. Moreover, commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal said there was demand for allowing the import of both commodities from animal husbandry sector.As for the criticism that the door has been kept ajar for more concessions, with India agreeing to discuss the US demand for further access to American farm goods, the agreement has a similar provision for India being granted greater access for its products.Also, prima facie, India should not have any problem in keeping its side of the bargain so far as the common objective of taking the trade volume to $500 billion by 2031 is concerned because of the sheer demand of its growing economy and because the US produces some of the best products, from airlines to semiconductor manufacturing equipment.By removing the pall of uncertainty that was hanging over bilateral ties and which gave Pakistan and other inimical players a reason to rejoice, the agreement can enhance assuredness in India's play in the diplomatic arena. At a press conference on Saturday, Goyal could not restrain himself, grinning when asked whether the formulation about the two countries agreeing to strengthen economic security alignment to enhance supply chain resilience and innovation through complementary actions to address ""non-market policies of third parties"" was aimed at China. ""Sajhne wale samajh gaye"" (the intelligent will understand), he said.","The framework for an interim agreement between the two countries as precursor to a Bilateral Trade Agreement appears to be a dramatic breakthrough. The lowering of tariff will especially help those engaged in MSME sector and labour-intensive sectors of apparels, leather and marine products.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128049373,imgsize-1011195,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"
The $500 billion question: What will India import?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/the-500-billion-question-what-will-india-import/articleshow/128049291.cms,"Ex-US Official Raymond Vickery Says India Outsmarted Donald Trump Chaos By Sticking To Trade Process

NEW DELHI: India's commitment to import $500 billion of goods from the US over five years depends not just on the ability of Indian companies to place orders but also on how quickly American suppliers can cater to the demand.Last year, India imported goods worth $45.5 billion from the US; during the first nine months of the ongoing fiscal year, it shipped close to $40 billion, of which over a fifth, or nearly $11 billion, comprised American crude and petroleum products. The oil shipments were 35% higher than the corresponding period of the previous fiscal year. Another $2.7 billion was accounted for by coal and coke.Govt officials said these are the product segments which will see an immediate increase given that India is likely to substitute some oil imports from other countries, including possibly Russia, with American oil. Besides, Indian oil companies have already signed an agreement to source more LNG.Similarly, India may substitute Indonesian coking coal with American product, which is also seen to be cheaper and of better quality, a senior official told TOI.""The increase to $100 billion of imports may not happen in the first year, but it will move in that direction,"" said the official. Commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal said that it is for Indian importers and US sellers to work out the products where imports will increase.""It is for them to make an offer that the buyers (in India) can't resist,"" he said, adding that high-tech products such as chips, semiconductors and airplanes and components will help reach the goal.For Indian buyers, there will be a challenge in terms of the ability of suppliers such as Boeing to export goods given the order backlog.Similarly, there is a massive demand for chips from across the globe, and Indian buyers will be in the queue for them as well.","Last year, India imported goods worth $45.5 billion from the US.

""To Benefit Farmers...."" Shivraj Singh Chouhan Big Claim On India-US Trade Deal

India retained protection on corn and soybean, both GM crops in US, but agreed to import dried distillers' grains and red sorghum for animal feed, tree nuts, fresh and processed fruits, soybean oil. Farm organisations say DDG comes from GM corn and questioned allowing import of soybean oil. RSS-linked BKS too sought a clarification. Farm minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan said, ""All our crops are safe.""NEW DELHI: India allowing import of animal feeds - dried distillers' grains (DDGs) and red sorghum - may benefit the country's livestock sector, but the move has attracted criticism from farm organisations, which said the DDGs would mostly come from genetically modified (GM) American corn.In India, DDGs are extracted from maize and rice as a byproduct, but its quality is not suitable as feed for broiler chickens and dairy cattle. The US has better quality and cheaper DDGs - a high-protein byproduct of corn ethanol production.Addressing a press conference, commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal said DDGs were included at the suggestion of the country's animal husbandry sector. Farm groups also questioned allowing the import of soyabean oil, saying US produces a transgenic variety of soyabean.The import of soyabean oil will adversely impact millions of soyabean farmers, they said.The RSS-linked Bharatiya Kisan Sangh too sought clarification on the issue. ""We strongly oppose the import of GM food and feed products from the US under the garb of this trade agreement, particularly soyabean oil and DDGs which would mostly come from GM maize,"" said Kirankumar Vissa and Kavitha Kuruganti of ASHA-Kisan Swaraj.The minister said that after processing, all GM traces are erased and the oil already being imported and consumed in the country follow the same process. Referring to the joint statement that says ""India also agrees to address long-standing non-tariff barriers to the trade in US food and agricultural products"", they said, ""this is coded language for lifting restrictions on GM food crops and products that have been in place in India"".The farm outfit also said the import of DDGs and red sorghum will impact the incomes of millions of farmers growing crops used for fodder and feed for animals and poultry. Mohini Mohan Mishra, all-India general secretary of BKS, said govt should present its position on this with more clarity.Goyal said the agreement makes it clear that GM food will not be allowed into India. On allowing import of DDGs, he said that after processing, the characteristics of genetic modification are eliminated.Agriculture minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan said, ""As agriculture minister, I can say with pride that the interests of our farmers have been fully safeguarded, whether it is with regard to basmati, rice, spices or textiles."" He added, ""As per the agreement reached with the US, all our crops are safe.

NEW DELHI: India has managed to protect its ground on dairy and farm products by retaining protection on the import of corn and soyabean, both genetically modified (GM) crops in the US, but agreed to eliminate or reduce tariffs on a wide range of American food and agricultural products, including dried distillers' grains (DDGs) and red sorghum for animal feed, tree nuts, fresh and processed fruits, soyabean oil, and wine and spirits.India has also agreed to address long-standing non-tariff barriers to the trade in US food and agricultural products. Though ""non-tariff' barriers are not explained in the India-US joint statement, it primarily indicates India's resistance to import of GM crops such as soyabean and maize (American corn), and dairy products which are produced from cows that are fed tissues, internal organs, blood meal and other animal-based formulation.""No GM items will be imported to India. No relief or concession has been given on dairy, maize, soya meal, sugar, millets, and citrus fruits,"" commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal said. The statement, released on Saturday, also mentioned ""additional products"" in the context of reducing or eliminating tariffs on US farm produce. The mention of ""additional products"", however, also remains unexplained, giving both the countries to negotiate it further beyond the scope of the interim deal.Under this head, India can always negotiate more access to the US market for the country's high-performing exports like shrimps, fish, spices, rice, tea, coffee and rubber.Among the list of items, which India will import, tree nuts - American almonds, pistachios and walnuts - and fresh fruits, mainly apple, will not impact the interest of Indian farmers as these crops have limited acreage in the country, and the production in any case is not keeping pace with growing demand. Besides, they come with safety valves such as import quotas and minimum import price. Further, there is a distinction made between unshelled - where cuts will be sharper given the possibility of ""value addition"" in India - and shelled - where the cuts will be lower. ""We import apples and the agreed quota is lower than what we import from the US,"" Goyal said, adding import duty of 20% and minimum import price of Rs 80 a kg, will ensure a landed price of around Rs 100 a kilo against Rs 75 at present. As far as Indian export is concerned, many farm produce would face zero reciprocal tariffs, with additional duties removed. These include spices, tea, coffee, coconut and coconut oil and cashew. ""No tariff concessions have been granted for agricultural products from US farmers entering India,"" he said.","India has managed to protect its ground on the import of corn and soyabean, both genetically modified (GM) crops in the US.

""To Benefit Farmers...."" Shivraj Singh Chouhan Big Claim On India-US Trade Deal

(Gulati is Distinguished Professor at ICRIER. Views are personal)

The patience of Narendra Modi govt seems to have paid. The US-India joint statement issued by the White House on Feb 6 gives some relief. It indicates what is likely to come in the trade deal. It is still an 'interim agreement' and there is no explicit mention that India will stop buying crude oil from Russia. More details will be known only when final agreement is reached sometime in March. But this joint statement surely shows convergence of interests between the two countries, and my preliminary research shows that it is likely to be mutually beneficial.Here are some of the details, which indicate that the trade deal is likely to be fair to both sides. The big gain is obviously to come from massive drop in import duties by the US from 50% to 18%. This will benefit immensely India's labour-intensive sectors, especially textiles and apparel, leather goods, gems and jewellery, and even agriculture. In the absence of this deal, there could have been a major loss in India's exports to the US in 2026. If you want to gauge its impact on the ground, talk to any apparel exporter in Tirupur or diamond exporter in Surat or shrimp exporters in Andhra Pradesh.They are heaving a big sigh of relief and celebrating. Indian exporters can now compete very well with their competitors, be it Bangladesh or Vietnam, which attract 20% duty, and India will be at a big advantage vis-a-vis China if the import duty on China's exports to the US remains at 35% or so.India has shown its 'intent' to buy lot of energy products, aeroplanes, and high-tech equipment from the US, which may be totalling roughly $500 billion over the next five years. So, there is some clarity on this front too. There has been lot of concern in India over the agriculture imports. The joint statement clearly states, ""India will eliminate or reduce tariffs on all US industrial goods and a wide range of US food and agricultural products, including dried distillers' grains (DDGs), red sorghum for animal feed, tree nuts, fresh and processed fruit, soyabean oil, wine and spirits, and additional products. ""The point to note is that there is no explicit mention of corn or soyabean, which are GMO (genetically modified organisms) products and about which India was concerned, although India's own cotton seed is a GM product. However, soyabean oil is there, which has been coming in any case from the US. The real new area is DDGs (distillers dried grains), which are in crushed form and it can be soyabean, corn, or any other grain, which are basically co-product of ethanol and used as poultry feed. India has been using its own grains (primarily corn and rice) for ethanol. There could be some substitution there with Indian DDG for feed, provided imported ones are cheaper. That will help India's poultry become more competitive.Tree nuts and berries have been of great interest to the US. Their biggest agri-export of the US to India has been almonds. Almost 90% of almonds being sold in India are from the US. They attract a duty of Rs 42/kg, which in ad valorem terms works out to roughly 10% of import value. But walnuts attract 120% duty currently, which is likely to be slashed to somewhere near almonds. Similar would be the case with pistachios, pecans, cranberries, blue berries, etc. Their import duties are likely to be brought down to within the range of 10-15%.Duty on cotton imports, which is at 5%, may be down to zero. Story of cotton is interesting. Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee had taken a bold decision in 2002 to allow the first GM crop, Bt cotton. The production of cotton jumped from roughly 13 million bales in 2002-03 to 39 million bales by 2012-13, making India the largest producer of cotton and second largest exporter of cotton. But then around 2014-15, we started messing up with this gene revolution by cutting down the trait fee to the company that had IPR of Bt cotton. As a result, that company walked away, and India could not get the successive fourth generation technology in cotton seeds. In 2024-25, India became a net importer of cotton and its production dropped to 29 million bales. Lesson is very clear: Either we invest in our own agri R&D or buy the best technologies from abroad. Our agri R&D budget of ICAR is about $1.1 billion for all crops, while Bayer, which has the best cotton seeds technology today, is investing euros 2.6 billion in 2024. India needs to heed the advice of PM Vajpayee who once said what IT (information technology) is for India, BT (biotechnology) is for Bharat. Gene editing is likely to be the future of agriculture, and India needs to invest in it for greater competitiveness.","US-India joint statement issued by the White House on Feb 6 gives some relief.

How Trump's claims on tariffs are far from reality,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/how-trumps-claim-on-tariffs-are-far-from-reality/articleshow/128000245.cms,"Beyond Tariffs: The India–US Deal and the Politics of Oil

Here is what Trump claimed and how far were they from facts

""Just over one year ago, we were a ‘DEAD’ country. Now, we are the ‘HOTTEST” country anywhere in the world!""

US was not dead when he returned to the Oval office for his second stint for POTUS. Despite a shaky start of his second term, the economy has performed strongly overall.

In 2024, the last year of the Biden presidency, American gross domestic product grew 2.8%, adjusted for inflation, faster than any wealthy country in the world except Spain. It also expanded at a healthy rate from 2021 through 2023.

presidency, American gross domestic product grew 2.8%, adjusted for inflation, faster than any wealthy country in the world except Spain. It also expanded at a healthy rate from 2021 through 2023. Meanwhile, first three quarters show that Trump’s tariffs - or even the threat of them - produced mixed outcomes. However, Full-year data for 2025 is not yet available.

From January to March, US GDP contracted for the first time in three years. The reason was clear: imports surged as American companies rushed to stock up on foreign goods ahead of potential tariff hikes. Since imports are subtracted from GDP, the spike dragged growth into negative territory.

The slowdown proved temporary. Growth rebounded sharply in the second quarter, with the economy expanding at an annualised rate of 3.8% from April to June. Momentum strengthened further in the third quarter, when growth accelerated to 4.4%. The rebound was driven in part by a decline in imports, reflecting both the impact of tariffs and earlier stockpiling. Strong consumer spending also played a major role.

Trump has also pointed to gains in the US stock market, noting that stocks hit record highs 52 times in 2025. While the market did post solid gains, its performance lagged several global peers.

“Annual core inflation for the past three months has dropped to just 1.4% - far lower than almost anyone, other than me, had predicted.”

According to news agency AP, Trump is using cherry-picked data to vastly exaggerate where inflation stands. Trump’s preferred inflation figure - annual inflation over the past three months excluding food and energy - is low. But it is also distorted. A government shutdown in October and November disrupted data collection, forcing the statistical agency to rely on rough estimates in some categories, which artificially pushed overall inflation lower.

Core inflation over the final six months of 2025 stood at 2.6%. That is lower than January 2025 levels but roughly in line with October 2024. Overall inflation has largely plateaued this year. It was running at 3% in September, before the shutdown - the same level as in January 2025.

It is true that inflation did not spike as sharply as many economists feared when Trump began rolling out tariffs last spring. But that is partly because many of the so-called “Liberation Day” tariffs were later withdrawn, scaled back or riddled with exemptions.

The impact of tariffs is clearer in core goods prices, which also exclude food and energy. Before the pandemic, core goods prices typically rose little or even fell year after year. By last December, however, they were 1.4% higher than a year earlier - the biggest increase outside the pandemic since 2011.

“The data shows that the burden, or ‘incidence,’ of the tariffs has fallen overwhelmingly on foreign producers and middlemen… paying at least 80% of tariff costs.”

The study Trump cited appears to show the opposite. Co-authored by Cavallo, it finds that US consumers bore about 43% of the tariff-related costs after seven months, with most of the remainder absorbed by US firms.

Cavallo said import prices barely declined, suggesting foreign exporters did not cut prices enough to shoulder most of the burden.

“We have slashed our monthly trade deficit by an astonishing 77%.”

This figure also relies on cherry-picking - comparing an unusually large deficit in January 2025, when Trump took office, with an unusually small one in October. The broader trend is less flattering.

From January through November 2025, the US ran a trade deficit of nearly $840 billion, about 4% higher than during the same period in 2024.

Imports surged in the first three months of the year as companies rushed to buy foreign goods ahead of tariffs.

While monthly deficits fell later in the year, the early import spike was so large that the year-to-date deficit still exceeds last year’s.

""I have successfully used tariffs to secure colossal investments in America… more than $18 trillion.”

Trump did use tariff threats to extract investment pledges from trading partners. The European Union alone promised $600 billion over four years.

But the administration has not explained how it arrived at the $18 trillion figure.

The White House has cited $9.6 trillion in public and private commitments. Researchers at the Peterson Institute for International Economics estimate the pledges at about $5 trillion from the EU, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Switzerland, Liechtenstein and Gulf states including Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Bahrain and the UAE.

has cited $9.6 trillion in public and private commitments. Researchers at the Peterson Institute for International Economics estimate the pledges at about $5 trillion from the EU, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Switzerland, Liechtenstein and Gulf states including Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Bahrain and the UAE. They also caution that many pledges are vague and may never fully materialise, in part because some countries would struggle to finance them.

The numbers are large by any measure. Total private investment in the US currently runs at about $5.4 trillion annually. In 2024, foreign direct investment - money put into factories, offices and other physical assets - totaled just $151 billion.

US President Donald Trump has, at several occasions, claimed that broad tariffs on different countries has revived the American economy. In his recent opinion piece in The Wall Street Journal, Trump claimed that tariffs have created an ""American economic miracle. ""He also lamented on critics and economists who predicted that tariffs would backfire, raising prices and threatening growth.""When I imposed historic tariffs on nearly all foreign countries last April, the critics said my policies would cause a global economic meltdown,"" US president wrote.""Instead, they have created an American economic miracle, and we are quickly building the greatest economy in the history of the world, with other countries doing just fine!"" he added.However, it appears the US president is playing fast and loose with his claims, which are often not supported by facts.","Despite a shaky start of his second term, the economy has performed strongly overall.

Iran’s IRGC ‘CAPTURE’ Two Foreign Oil Tankers, Send Message To Trump Ahead Of Iran-US Nuke Talks

The United States on Friday announced new sanctions targeting Iran’s oil and petrochemical trade, hours after indirect talks between Tehran and Washington concluded in Oman.The move came even as both sides signalled willingness to continue negotiations aimed at easing tensions over Iran’s nuclear programme.The sanctions, unveiled by the US State Department, target 15 entities and 14 vessels linked to Iran’s “shadow fleet,” which is used to transport petroleum, petroleum products and petrochemicals in violation of international restrictions, according to Reuters.In a statement, State Department spokesperson Tommy Pigott said that the measures were part of the Trump administration’s renewed pressure campaign against Tehran.“President Donald Trump is committed to driving down the Iranian regime's illicit oil and petrochemical exports under the administration's maximum pressure campaign,” Pigott said.The United States said that the fresh sanctions were aimed at cutting off revenue streams that Tehran uses to fund repression at home and destabilising activities abroad.Pigott accused Tehran of prioritising repression and regional destabilisation over domestic welfare.“Instead of investing in the welfare of its own people and crumbling infrastructure, the Iranian regime continues to fund destabilizing activities around the world and step up its repression inside Iran,” he said.Warning of continued pressure, he added: “So long as Iranian regime attempts to evade sanctions and generate oil and petrochemical revenues to fund such oppressive behavior and support terrorist activities and proxies, the United States will act to hold both the Iranian regime and its partners accountable.”Among the entities sanctioned by the United States is an India-based firm involved in managing a vessel accused of transporting Iranian petroleum products in violation of international restrictions.According to the US State Department, Elevate Marine Management Private Limited (ELEVATE), an Indian commercial shipping management company, served as the commercial manager of the BENEDICT, a Cameroon-flagged crude oil tanker. The vessel is alleged to have transported Iranian petroleum products on at least three occasions between September and November 2025.Akash Anant Shinde is an Indian national and director of Elevate Marine Management Private Limited.The announcement came shortly after Iranian and US officials wrapped up a day of indirect negotiations in Muscat, mediated by Oman. The talks were described as constructive by TehranIran’s foreign minister Abbas Araghchi, speaking after the talks, struck a cautiously optimistic tone, calling the discussions “a good start.”“If we can go along with this positive path, I can say that we can reach a positive framework regarding the nuclear talks between Iran and the US,” Araghchi told reporters.He said both sides had agreed to continue discussions after further consultations in their respective capitals.“Our concerns were conveyed, as well as our interests and the rights that the Iranian people have. It was conveyed in a very good atmosphere, and the views of the other side were also heard,” he added.According to Oman’s foreign ministry, foreign minister Badr al-Busaidi met separately with Araghchi and US Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff in Muscat.Footage later released by Oman’s state news agency showed US Navy Admiral Brad Cooper, head of US Central Command also present.The negotiations mark the first formal engagement since the United States joined Israel’s military action against Iran in June, during which US strikes damaged Iranian nuclear facilities.Israel also targeted Iran’s air defence systems and ballistic missile infrastructure. Since then, Washington has bolstered its military presence in the region, deploying additional warships, fighter jets and the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln.US officials have indicated that Washington wants the talks to go beyond Iran’s nuclear programme to include its missile capabilities and regional influence. Iran, however, has insisted that discussions remain limited.US Secretary of State Marco Rubio acknowledged the difficulty of the negotiations earlier this week, saying, “I’m not sure you can reach a deal with these guys, but we’re going to try to find out.”Tensions remain high as both sides weigh diplomacy against the risk of escalation. The US has recently shot down an Iranian drone near the USS Abraham Lincoln, while Iran has attempted to stop a US-flagged vessel in the Strait of Hormuz.Friday’s sanctions also follow similar measures imposed last month, when the US targeted vessels accused of moving hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of Iranian oil.The Treasury Department has said that Iran’s shadow fleet plays a critical role in financing the regime, including its domestic crackdowns and regional activities.","The sanctions target 15 entities and 14 vessels linked to Iran’s ‘shadow fleet,’ which is used to transport petroleum, petroleum products and petrochemicals in violation of international restrictions.

AI spending worries hit Amazon

Bitcoin stabilises, crypto stocks jump

Consumers, airlines and smaller stocks gain

US stock markets moved higher on Friday, clawing back part of the heavy losses seen earlier in the week, as technology shares recovered and bitcoin halted its recent slide.The rebound came after several volatile sessions driven by worries over massive spending on artificial intelligence and its impact on corporate profits.The S&P 500 rose 0.9 per cent, marking only its second gain in the past eight sessions. The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 776 points, or 1.6 per cent, while the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.5 per cent by mid-morning trading in New York.Chipmakers led the recovery. Nvidia climbed 4.9 per cent, trimming a weekly decline of more than 10 per cent, while Broadcom gained 3.8 per cent after falling sharply earlier in the week.According to news agency AP, hopes of strong long-term demand for chips linked to artificial intelligence continued to support the sector.Despite the broader rebound, concerns over soaring AI investment remained. Amazon shares slumped 8.5 per cent after the company said it expects to spend around $200 billion this year on areas such as AI, chips, robotics and low-earth-orbit satellites.Similar spending plans announced earlier by Alphabet have raised questions about whether such large investments will deliver enough future profits.As per news agency AFP, investors have grown cautious after a period when enthusiasm around AI lifted much of the technology sector.Chris Low of FHN Financial said markets were now reassessing whether the sell-off had gone too far, noting that traders felt some of the recent declines may have been “overdone”.Even with Friday’s gains, the S&P 500 was still on course for its third weekly fall in four weeks.Bitcoin showed signs of stabilising after weeks of losses that wiped out more than half its value since its October peak.The cryptocurrency recovered to around $68,000 after briefly slipping near $60,000 late on Thursday.The move helped lift shares linked to the crypto sector. Robinhood Markets surged 11.7 per cent, Coinbase Global rose 7.3 per cent, and Strategy, a company known for holding large amounts of bitcoin, jumped 15.9 per cent.US consumer sentiment also provided some support. A preliminary survey from the University of Michigan showed sentiment improving slightly, defying expectations of a fall. The improvement was strongest among households that own shares.Airline stocks gained on hopes that stronger confidence would translate into more travel spending. United Airlines rose 5.4 per cent, American Airlines gained 4.6 per cent, and Delta Air Lines added 4.4 per cent.Smaller companies outperformed larger peers, with the Russell 2000 index climbing 2.3 per cent.

German exports to the United States plunged last year due to President Donald Trump's tariff blitz, and the trade surplus of Europe's top economy with the US shrunk to a four-year low, data showed Friday.But total exports for 2025 rebounded by around one percent following two years of contraction, as stronger trade with Europe offset falling shipments to the United States, statistics agency Destatis said.German exports to the United States fell 9.3 percent last year, while US imports to Germany rose slightly.Germany's trade surplus with the world's biggest economy was 52.2 billion euros ($62 billion), its lowest level since 2021, after a record surplus the previous year of nearly 70 billion euros.China returned as Germany's biggest trading partner last year, overtaking the US, as exports from the world's number two economy to Germany rose sharply, according to the preliminary data.Europe was in Trump's crosshairs when he launched his tariff onslaught as it runs a hefty trade surplus with the United States, much of it due to German exports.Under a deal struck in July, EU exports to the United States face a baseline levy of 15 percent -- far higher than before Trump's return to office.It was a heavy blow for Germany, whose firms, from well-known automakers and machinery giants to smaller, family-owned companies, have long relied on robust trade with the United States.","German exports to the United States fell 9.3 percent last year, while US imports to Germany rose slightly.

US job vacancies declined to their lowest level in more than five years in December, underscoring persistent softness in the labour market despite strong economic growth, according to AP.Data released by the US Labor Department showed job openings fell to 6.5 million in December from 6.9 million in November, marking the lowest level since September 2020. The figure also came in below economists’ expectations. Layoffs edged higher during the period, while the number of people voluntarily quitting jobs — an indicator of worker confidence — remained broadly unchanged at 3.2 million.The data highlights a widening gap between economic expansion and hiring momentum. While gross domestic product grew at its fastest pace in two years during the July–September quarter, job creation has slowed significantly. Employers have added an average of just 28,000 jobs per month since March, compared with roughly 400,000 monthly additions during the post-pandemic hiring surge between 2021 and 2023.Upcoming labour market data is expected to show modest improvement. Economists anticipate that January employment numbers, due next week, may show around 70,000 new jobs added, up from 50,000 in December.Recent private data has also pointed to subdued hiring conditions. Payroll processor ADP reported that private sector employers added only 22,000 jobs last month, far below market forecasts. Separately, outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas said companies announced more than 108,000 job cuts, the highest monthly total since October and the weakest January reading since 2009.Commenting on the trend, Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union, said: “The hiring recession isn’t going to end anytime soon. Job openings in December just fell to their lowest level since September 2020. It’s yet another sign of how little hiring – or interest in hiring – is happening in this economy.”Economists remain divided on the outlook, debating whether hiring will eventually pick up to match strong economic growth, whether growth may slow to reflect labour market weakness, or whether advances in artificial intelligence and automation could allow output to expand without significant job creation.","Job openings fell to 6.5 million in December from 6.9 million in November.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.","Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor (CEA) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas.

How India's GDP has been growing

What SBI report said on savings and investment

Incremental capital output ratio

NEW DELHI: India's gross domestic product (GDP) data for the third quarter (October-December 2022) received a word of caution from the former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan In an interview with news agency PTI, Rajan that India is ""dangerously close"" to the Hindu rate of growth in view of subdued private sector investment, high interest rates and slowing global growth.India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying"".However, a report released by the State Bank of India (SBI) economists on Tuesday dismissed arguments that India is dangerously close to Hindu rate of growth saying such statements are ""ill-conceived, biased and premature"".The term 'Hindu growth rate' was coined by late economist Raj Krishna in 1978 to describe the slow growth in the country.It basically refers to the low pace of economic growth rates during 1950s to 1980s. During this period, the Indian economy averaged 3.5%.A former lecturer at the Delhi School of Economics (DSE), Krishna noted that only if the rate of growth is persistently slow and accompanied by low per-capita GDP, then it will be known as Hindu rate of growth but it has to factor in population growth as well.Before economic reforms of 1991, India's economic growth remained stagnant and low, while per capita income averaged around 1.3%.Krishna termed this low growth situation to be a result of socialist policies of state control and import substitution.However, the economic situation changed when liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation (LPG) reforms came into effect in the year 1991, at a time when India faced balance of payment crisis.Over the years, many economists have strongly opposed the idea of 'Hindu growth rate' and the term never had universal acceptance.The Indian economy plunged into its very first technical recession in FY21 due to the impact of Covid-19 pandemic and the related nationwide lockdowns. GDP shrunk by an unprecedented 23.8% in the first quarter of the financial year 2020-21. However, due to spurt in economic activities in the subsequent quarters, the GDP decline started to narrow.However, if we look at the period before Covid-19 as well, India's growth curve shows a declining trend.From 8.26% in FY17, GDP growth plunged to 3.74% in FY20. Shutdown of economic activities in FY21 in wake of Covid-19 only made matters worse.As lockdowns started to ease and business activities resumed, India's GDP also started rising. In Q1 of FY22, growth jumped to 20.1% mainly on account of low base effect. By the fourth quarter of FY22, growth came down to 4.10%.Similarly, the new financial year 2022-23 brought fresh economic challenges in the form of Russia-Ukraine war that impacted almost all major economies of the world, slowed the pace of growth, pushed inflation to record highs.As a result, the central banks of all advanced economies spurred into action and opted for monetary policy tightening to curb the soaring inflation.With persistently rising interest rates, India's economy grew by 4.4% in Q3 of FY23, as the Centre revised upwards GDP growth for previous year to 9.10% from 8.7% earlier.The report weighed recent GDP numbers against the available data on savings and investments for the past decade and highlighted some interesting points.""Quarterly growth numbers are noisy and should be best avoided for any serious interpretation (on an average, India's GDP growth has witnessed Rs 2 lakh crore upward revision for the 3 year ended FY23),"" the report said.Gross capital formation (GCF) by the government touched a high of 11.8% in 2021-22, up from 10.7% in 2020-21.""This also had a domino effect on private sector investment that jumped from 10 per cent to 10.8% over the same period,"" it said.In fact, Ecowrap added that the trends in GCF to gross output ratio or the plough back of funds for creation of fresh capacity shows that for public administration the ratio attained fresh peak in 2021-22 owing to the emphasis on capital expenditure in recent budgets.At the aggregate level, gross capital formation is supposed to have crossed 32% in 2022-23, the highest level since 2018-19.According to the report, in 2021-22, gross savings have risen to 30% from 29% in 2020-21.""The ratio is supposed to have crossed 31 per cent in 2022-23, the highest since 2018-19. The household savings increased sharply during the pandemic period on account of sharp accretion in financial savings such as deposits,"" said the report by SBI's Economic Research Department.While household financial savings have since then moderated from 15.4% in 2020-21 to 11.1% in 2022-23, savings in physical assets have grown sharply to 11.8% in 2021-22 from 10.7% in 2020-21.The report further analysed Incremental Capital Output ratio (ICOR) -- which measures additional units of capital (investment) needed to produce additional units of output. It said that the ratio has been improving.""ICOR which was 7.5 in FY 12 is now only 3.5 in FY22. Clearly, only half of capital is now needed for next unit of output,"" the report noted.Such reducing ICOR in the current years reflects a relatively increasing efficiency of capital and shows that the economy is on a sound footing, the report said.""From that point of view, future GDP growth rates even at 7% could still mean a decent number by any standards!,"" it added.","India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter.

An employee is entitled for a 50 per cent amount of the last drawn salary as pension.OPS was discontinued by the NDA government in 2003 with effect from April 1, 2004.Under the new pension scheme (NPS), employees contribute 10 per cent of their basic salary towards pension while the government contributes 14 per cent.Governments of Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand have informed the central government/ Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA about their decision to restart OPS for their employees.The government of Punjab on November 18, 2022, issued a notification regarding implementation of OPS for the state government employees who are being covered under NPS. Jharkhand too has decided to revert to OPS.",Former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan has expressed his concern over the decision of some states to restart the old pension scheme.

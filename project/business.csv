Income Tax Changes FY 2025-26: April 1, 2025, signals the start of the fresh fiscal year. As the new financial year begins, several new income tax regulations come into effect, including a more rationalised new income tax regime, higher basic exemption limit and tax rates. Additionally, several changes in TDS, TCS rules also take effect.Understanding these new income tax rules is crucial, as they influence tax deductions from various income sources, including salary and interest earnings. Additionally, these changes will determine your tax liability for income earned in FY 2025-26.The revised new tax regime introduces new income tax slabs and rates. Under the new income tax regime income above Rs 24 lakh will now attract a 30% tax rate as against Rs 15 lakh earlier. Also, the basic exemption limit has been raised from Rs 3 lakh to Rs 4 lakh.With changes in the new income tax regime, individuals earning a taxable income up to Rs 12 lakh will now have to pay ZERO tax! This provision applies exclusively to individuals who select the new tax regime in FY 2025-26. However, this does not exempt one from filing an income tax return (ITR). The zero tax benefit is available through a tax rebate under Section 87A of the Income Tax Act, 1961.To access the tax rebate under Section 87A, individuals must submit their ITR. For salaried individuals earning up to Rs 12.75 lakh, there will be no tax with a Rs 75,000 standard deduction.Also Read | How to calculate income tax with latest tax slabs: Have taxable income above Rs 12 lakh? Know how it will be taxed under new income tax regime The Budget 2025 has introduced modifications to the taxation structure of specific ULIPs. The revised regulations specify that ULIP proceeds not qualifying for exemption under Section 10 (10D) shall be classified as capital assets and will be incorporated within the equity-oriented funds category, according to an ET report.Consequently, proceeds from ULIPs that do not qualify for Section 10 (10D) exemption will face capital gains taxation. A 20% tax rate applies to short-term gains, whilst long-term gains attract a 12.5% tax without the benefit of indexation.Tax exemption under Section 10 (10D) continues to apply to ULIP proceeds where the annual premium remains below Rs 2.5 lakh.Tax experts note that previously, there existed no definitive taxation guidelines for ULIPs with premiums exceeding Rs 2.5 lakh. This ambiguity arose because ULIPs, unlike conventional policies, direct a substantial portion of premiums towards stock market investments, making traditional policy taxation frameworks unsuitable. These taxation revisions take effect from FY 2025-26.The Budget 2025 has introduced modifications to TDS provisions, encompassing adjustments to rates and elevating thresholds for implementing these provisions.Key TDS amendments include:a) Section 194LBC TDS rate adjustment: This applies to income distributed by securitisation trust to resident investors. Currently, until March 31, 2025, individuals or Hindu Undivided families face 25% TDS, whilst others face 30%. Starting April 1, 2025, a uniform 10% TDS rate shall apply.b) Threshold adjustments: Effective April 1, 2025, elevated thresholds will apply to sections 193, 194A, 194, 194K, 194B, 194BB, 194D, 194G, 194H, 194-I, 194J and 194LA, enabling taxpayers to retain more disposable income.The government has eliminated provisions requiring increased TDS and TCS rates for ITR non-filers. This revision takes effect from April 1, 2025, removing higher TDS and TCS obligations for those who haven't submitted ITRs in specified periods.The Budget 2025 memorandum states: ""Section 206AB of the Act, requires deduction of tax at higher rate when the deductee specified therein is a non-filer of income-tax return. Section 206CCA of the Act, requires for collection of tax at higher rate when the collectee specified therein is a non-filer of income-tax return. This is subject to other conditions specified in the two sections. Representations were received from various stakeholders that it is difficult for the deductor/collector, at the time of deduction/collection, to verify whether returns have been filed by the deductee/collectee, resulting in application of higher rates of deduction/collection, blocking of capital and increased compliance burden. Accordingly, to address this issue and reduce compliance burden for the deductor/collector, it is proposed to omit section 206AB of the Act and section 206CCA of the Act.""Also Read | Latest income tax slabs FY 2025-26: What are the new income tax slabs, rates after Budget 2025 announcements? Check new vs old tax regime comparison - FAQs answered The recent Budget 2025 has incorporated NPS Vatsalya contributions within Section 80CCD framework. Individuals can now avail deductions for their NPS Vatsalya contributions under this section. This benefit remains exclusive to taxpayers who continue with the old tax regime.Starting April 1, 2025, the Budget has revised the tax-free perquisite thresholds for employed individuals. The updated regulations permit tax exemption on employer-funded international medical treatment expenses, covering both employees and their family members.Starting April 1, 2025, the authorities have granted immunity from legal proceedings for delayed Tax Collected at Source (TCS) payments under specific circumstances. The revised regulations specify that no legal action shall commence against individuals who remit TCS to the Central Government before the prescribed deadline for submitting quarterly statements.Also Read | Budget 2025 Income Tax calculator explained: Save up to Rs 1.1 lakh! How income tax slab changes will benefit taxpayers at different salary levels under new regime The timeframe for submitting updated returns has been lengthened. Under the revised regulations effective April 1, 2025, individuals now have 48 months from the assessment year's conclusion to submit their updated returns. Previously, taxpayers were allowed 24 months post-assessment year to file these returns. The new provision doubles the available time period.The tax authorities have streamlined the process of calculating annual house value for taxation purposes. This revision enables straightforward income tax filing by allowing nil value declaration for any two properties.The authorities have modified the annual value definition for self-occupied properties, providing clarity to homeowners whilst maintaining the existing two-property restriction.Beginning April 1, 2025, tax officials will conduct comparative analyses between current and previous Income Tax Returns (ITRs) to identify inconsistencies. This provision takes effect from April 1, 2025. Whilst the implementation date is confirmed, the tax authority has not yet detailed which specific discrepancies they will examine across both ITRs.Also Read | How much tax do individuals earning slightly above Rs 12 lakh have to pay?

Poll Do you believe this market downturn will continue? No Yes

Why stock market crashed today

1) Concerns over Trump's tariff strategy

2) IT sector faces headwinds

3) Oil prices reach significant levels

4) Market consolidation follows upward trend



Stay informed with the latest business news, updates on bank holidays and public holidays.



Stock market crash today: BSE Sensex and Nifty50, the Indian equity benchmark indices, tanked in trade on Tuesday. While BSE Sensex plunged below 76,000 intraday, Nifty50 went below 23,150. BSE Sensex closed the day at 76,024.51, down 1,390 points or 1.80%. Nifty50 ended at 23,165.70, down 354 points or 1.50%.Indian equity markets declined for a second consecutive session on Tuesday, with the Sensex and Nifty experiencing significant drops, primarily affected by IT and banking sectors. The market sentiment was subdued due to apprehensions regarding U.S. President Donald Trump's proposed comprehensive reciprocal tariffs.All major sectors, except automotive, showed negative performance, with Nifty IT, Realty, Financial, and Consumer Durables sectors declining between 1-3%.The aggregate market value of companies listed on the BSE declined by Rs 3.23 lakh crore, reaching Rs 409.64 lakh crore, according to an ET report.Ajit Mishra – SVP, Research, Religare Broking said, “Market participants are closely monitoring the ongoing tariff talks and their sectoral impact, leading to profit-booking following the recent rebound. Additionally, the Nifty index, which had been consolidating, has slipped below its range and breached the moving average ribbon support at 23,400. The next crucial support lies around 23,100 (20 DEMA), and a breakdown below this level could further dampen sentiment, whereas holding above it may pave the way for a recovery. Given the mixed signals, it is advisable to be cautious with index positions and maintain a stock-specific trading approach.""Investors remain cautious as April 2 approaches, which Trump has designated as ""Liberation Day,"" when he plans to reveal extensive reciprocal tariffs. Trump's weekend statements suggested these tariffs would affect all nations, not exclusively those with substantial trade deficits, triggering concerns about potential global economic slowdown due to trade conflicts.""Globally markets are focused on the details of Trump's reciprocal tariffs to be announced tomorrow. The market trends after the announcements will depend on the details of the tariffs and how they will impact different countries and sectors,"" said Dr. VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Investments Limited.Information technology firms, with substantial US market exposure, declined 1.8% due to softening demand outlook. The sector's 15% decline in the March quarter has negatively impacted the Nifty 50 performance.""We expect the FY26 revenue outlook for IT firms to be in-line to disappointing, and downside risks to earnings remain,"" Morgan Stanley analysts noted.Oil values approached a five-week peak, triggering inflation worries. Brent crude stood at $74.67 per barrel, whilst US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) was at $71.37. Elevated oil prices potentially affect India's fiscal deficit and company profit margins.The Nifty and Sensex recorded 5.4% gains across eight sessions, moving into positive territory for the year. Recent profit-taking activities have led to market correction. Elevated valuations in a brief period have prompted caution amongst traders, resulting in selling of major stocks.""India outperformed most markets in March with 6.3% return. FIIs turning buyers and the consequent short covering contributed to the rally. Can the rally continue or will there be another downturn? This will depend mainly on what Trump announces in tariffs. If the tariffs are lower-than-feared there can be a rally in the market which will be led by externally linked sectors like pharmaceuticals and IT. On the other hand if the tariffs are severe there can be another round of downturn in the market,"" Vijayakumar said.","BSE Sensex and Nifty50, the Indian equity benchmark indices, tanked in trade on Tuesday.

UPI withdrawals for PF members



Stay informed with the latest business news, updates on bank holidays and public holidays.



The Employees Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has announced to increase in the auto-settlement of advance claims (ASAC) limit, raising it five times from Rs 1 lakh to Rs 5 lakh. The move is designed to enhance the 'ease of living' for its 7.5 crore members, sources told news agency ANI.According to sources, Sumita Dawra, Secretary of the Ministry of Labour and Employment, approved the proposal during the 113th meeting of the Executive Committee (EC) of the Central Board of Trustees (CBT) in Srinagar, Jammu and Kashmir, on March 28.“This revision will enhance the ease of living for crores of our members,” Dawra said in a statement. Following this approval, the recommendation will be forwarded for final approval by the CBT. Once approved, EPFO members will be able to withdraw up to Rs 5 lakh through the auto-settlement process.EPFO’s auto-settlement process has seen tremendous growth, processing a record 2.16 crore auto-claims as of March 6, 2025, compared to just 89.52 lakh claims in the previous year. This reflects the increasing efficiency of the system, with 95% of claims now being settled automatically within three days.“The auto-settlement process has greatly simplified claim settlements, significantly reducing the time and human intervention required,” said Ramesh Krishnamurthi, Central Provident Fund Commissioner. “We are committed to making the process more efficient, and with the increasing number of automated claims, our goal is to make accessing PF funds easier for all members.”Additionally, EPFO has expanded the categories for which advance claims can be settled automatically, now covering illness, education, marriage, housing, and more. The system’s improvements have also led to a reduction in the rejection rate of claims, from 50% last year to just 30% this year.In another game-changing development, EPFO will soon allow Provident Fund (PF) withdrawals through Unified Payments Interface (UPI) and ATMs. The Ministry of Labour and Employment has given approval for the plan, and members will be able to access their funds through UPI and ATMs by the end of May or June 2025.“This new system will make it even more convenient for members to access their PF savings instantly through UPI and ATMs,” Dawra said. “It is a groundbreaking move that will set a precedent for other government savings schemes, like the General Provident Fund (GPF) for government employees and the Public Provident Fund (PPF) for bank customers.”","The Employees Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has announced to increase in the auto-settlement of advance claims (ASAC) limit, raising it five times from Rs 1 lakh to Rs 5 lakh.

NEW DELHI: FM Nirmala Sitharaman on Tuesday said there should not be any politics on public finance, as it has a long-term impact on the Centre and states.""Raising money is important, as much as managing your debt. There is no good if I am being very good in terms of giving projects or schemes to the public...but have no resources for it. Equally, it is also very tempting to keep borrowing,"" she said at an event to launch States Economic Forum, a portal put together by Nitit Aayog and the National Council for Applied Economic Research. While borrowing all the realities have to be kept in mind, she said, adding that there is a temptation for borrowing to push growth all over the world.""If there is a struggle to become a faster-growing economy, equally, there is a big struggle to contain your borrowing. Countries have become so debt-ridden, and it is going to take a generation even to come to acceptable levels, leave alone ideal levels,"" she said.She cited the example of deliberation in the GST Council and said that state finance ministers, cutting across party lines, discuss proposals while maintaining a focus on generating revenue, without burdening the public. NCAER director general Poonam Gupta said that between 2013 and 2023, debt levels increased in all but four of the 28 states. The minister was all praise for the ministry of statistics, complimenting the recent initiatives on data, which, she said, had reinforced confidence in official statistics.","FM Nirmala Sitharaman: Raising money is important, as much as managing your debt.

For the full year, govt estimated an increase of 9.5% to over Rs 22 lakh crore, which marked the slowest pace of expansion since 2020-21, the year that saw massive disruption due to Covid-19 pandemic.There was also a 41% jump in refunds, pegged at Rs 19,615 crore in March, again driven by a 202% jump in import-related refunds.""India's sustained growth in GST collections suggests a resilient domestic economy, seemingly insulated from global economic challenges, driven by strong consumer spending. However, a 13.5% increase in import GST compared to March 2024 highlights a significant rise in imports compared to the same period last year. Further, it's noteworthy that there has been a 25.7% surge in export refunds year-on-year, which indicates that govt's manufacturing initiatives are showing positive results,"" said Saurabh Agarwal, tax partner at EY India.The slower growth in collections may increase govt monitoring, tax experts said. ""One can expect more rigour in GST audits and scrutiny to plug the leakages. The slowdown in consumption is an area, which also needs to be addressed,"" said Pratik Jain, partner at PwC.During the last financial year, Haryana (16% rise), Delhi (15.9%), Maharashtra (12.4%) and Bihar (12.1%) were the top performers. Arunachal and Nagaland saw collections decline by 8% and 4%, respectively.","GST collections went up 9.9% to Rs 1,96,141 crore in March, second highest monthly collection ever.

MUMBAI: The sensex dived nearly 1,400 points on Tuesday, settling just above the 76k mark, as concerns over Trump's tariffs rattled investor confidence on Dalal Street. Foreign funds were aggressive sellers during the day.The decline, which marked the index's worst day since Feb 28, was driven by HDFC Bank ICICI Bank , RIL and Infosys. Rising crude oil prices also weighed on investor sentiment, market players said.

Vodafone Idea's shares experienced a significant increase of 19.41%, reaching Rs 8.15 on the BSE on Tuesday, following the government's decision to convert Rs 36,950 crore of the company's spectrum payment dues into equity, thereby improving its financial position and reducing statutory obligations.The government's stake in Vi will increase to 48.99% from 22.6%, whilst the holdings of private promoters Vodafone Plc and Aditya Birla Group will decrease to 16.1% and 9.4% respectively, although they will maintain operational control.Specifically, Vodafone UK's ownership will reduce from 24.4% to 16.1%, whilst ABG's stake will decrease from approximately 14% to 9.4%, according to company sources who spoke to ET.This governmental intervention is regarded as crucial support for the struggling telecommunications operator. This conversion, the second following a similar action in February 2023, will provide essential cash flow assistance to Vi, particularly as it prepares for increased regulatory payments after the moratorium expires in September.Experts note that Vi, currently operating at a loss, needs to settle Rs 29,000 crore in government spectrum and adjusted gross revenue (AGR) dues in the latter half of FY26.

24-hour disruption a challenge

PUNE: Several areas in the city, especially eastern parts, that rely on the Bhama Askhed project will not receive water on Thursday (April 3), as the Pune Municipal Corporation has planned major maintenance works at its supply units and purification plants at Parvati, Pune Cantonment, Holkar, Wadgaon Budruk, and Warje. The distribution will resume on Friday, after 24 hours.The dam, located outside the city, mainly caters to residents of areas like Wadgaon Sheri, Chandannagar, Vimannagar, Yerawada, parts of Lohegaon. pockets along Nagar Road, Kothrud, Satara and Solapur Road.A day-long disruption is likely to be a challenge for residents as they claimed that on several occasions the civic body failed to restore the supply to full capacity in all affected areas the next day.Officials from PMC's water supply department said they had asked the supply units to provide uninterrupted water to the distribution network for the next three days so that people could stock up water to tackle the shortage on Thursday.People from tail-end areas like Kharadi, Dhankawadi, Indiranagar and Mundhwa, however, said the administration should provide tankers on Friday as the restoration would take at least 12 hours in the pockets located at the end of the distribution network.Local former corporator Mahendra Pathare from Kharadi said though the administration claimed restoration by Friday, it would never happen. ""In the past, we always have approached the local ward office and the water supply department to deploy tankers,"" Pathare said.As per PMC's plan, the water pumping will resume in a phased manner from Thursday night.","Pune will face a 24-hour water supply disruption on Thursday, April 3, due to maintenance at the Bhama Askhed project and several purification plants.

"$1.4 trillion trade war: How Trump tariffs could hit the world, may lift India slightly",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/1-4-trillion-trade-war-how-trump-tariffs-could-hit-the-world-may-lift-india-slightly/articleshow/119870688.cms,"Driving the news

According to a Financial Times report that is based on econometric study by Aston University, a worst-case global retaliation to Trump’s proposed 25% tariffs could hammer the world economy with a $1.4 trillion income hit and cripple global trade.

The research models six escalating scenarios based on bilateral trade data from 132 countries, showing how a tit-for-tat tariff spiral would move from North America to Europe and beyond — destabilizing supply chains and inflating prices.

As per a Washington Post report, White House adviser Peter Navarro said Sunday that President Donald Trump’s new tariffs would generate more than $6 trillion in federal revenue over the next ten years — a projection that, if realized, would amount to the largest peacetime tax increase in modern US history, according to experts.

Speaking on Fox News, Navarro said the tariffs on auto imports would bring in $100 billion annually. He added that a broader set of still-unspecified tariffs would yield an additional $600 billion per year, totaling $6 trillion over the next decade.

Why it matters

Trump’s advisers argue the economic pain is worth it. They envision a future where American factories hum again, imports shrink, and tariff revenue funds a new era of domestic tax cuts.

“Access to cheap goods is not the essence of the American Dream,” said treasury secretary Scott Bessent. “The dream is rooted in upward mobility and economic security.”

But investors and economists aren’t convinced. The S&P 500 dropped 4.6% in Q1, its worst start since 2022.

Goldman Sachs increased the probability of a US recession to 35%, up from 20%.

US allies, including Canada, Japan, and Germany, have warned the White House that indiscriminate tariffs could spark retaliatory spirals and damage global growth.

“This is going to be much bigger than Smoot-Hawley,” said economic historian Douglas Irwin. “Imports are a much greater share of GDP now than they were in the early 1930s.”

We’re going to charge countries for doing business in our country and taking our jobs, taking our wealth, taking a lot of things that they’ve been taking over the years. They’ve taken so much out of our country, friend and foe. Donald Trump

US exports fall over 46%, triggering steep domestic inflation of more than 5%.

Living standards decline globally, especially in countries heavily dependent on US trade.

Bloomberg Economics estimates US GDP could shrink by 4% if tariffs are widely imposed and retaliated. Prices could jump 2.5% over 2–3 years, hurting consumer purchasing power.

India, the UK, Japan, and South Korea could benefit temporarily — but only if escalation remains moderate.

In short: India might catch a breeze in the early gusts, but it won’t escape the storm.

What’s next?

The bottom line



Stay informed with the latest business news, updates on bank holidays and public holidays.



On April 2, in a Rose Garden ceremony, US President Donald Trump will declare “Liberation Day.” But instead of freeing the economy, the tariffs he plans to unveil could slam the brakes on global growth, ignite inflation, and throw the world into an economic tailspin.Trump’s plan — targeting countries that impose higher tariffs on US goods — could significantly reshape the global economic order. According to the FT report, the research conducted by economists at Aston University explores how a cycle of retaliatory tariffs triggers intricate changes in global trade, initially impacting North America—specifically the US, Mexico, and Canada—before extending to Europe and eventually affecting the rest of the world.While a few nations like India may reap modest gains from diverted trade, the bigger picture is grim:India’s strategic opportunity—and its limitsIndia appears, on paper, to be one of the few countries with something to gain. In scenarios where trade patterns shift to avoid US-EU or US-China tariff barriers, India, along with the UK, Japan, and South Korea, could benefit modestly from trade diversion. These countries might see increased demand for exports in sectors where the US previously relied on more tariff-encumbered suppliers.For India, the opportunity lies in electronics, pharmaceuticals, and textiles—sectors already being nurtured under the “Make in India” initiative. The country’s growing reputation as a manufacturing alternative to China, along with a neutral position outside major trade blocs like the EU, could position it as a go-to supplier in a time of uncertainty.But the gains are marginal. And fleeting.“India might benefit from a few supply chain shifts,” said a senior economist at a New Delhi-based think tank, “but if the global trade environment turns volatile, capital flows will become unstable, inflation will rise, and the ripple effects will catch up.”Indeed, India imports much of its energy, machinery, and high-end components. A broad-based trade war would make many of these imports more expensive. That would stoke inflation and squeeze the government’s fiscal room. The Reserve Bank of India, already cautious due to sticky food prices, might be forced to tighten policy—potentially dampening growth.Back to the future?Interestingly, Trump’s renewed tariff push comes at a time when the US economy is more reliant on imports than ever before. Its imports now account for roughly 14–16% of US GDP — a figure nearly triple what it was during the protectionist Smoot-Hawley era of the 1930s. This underscores how deeply integrated the US is in global supply chains today. A return to aggressive tariffs, like those Trump is proposing, risks shocking a system built on decades of liberalized trade policy, a Bloomberg report said.Next, if fully implemented, his ""reciprocal tariff"" strategy would drive US average tariff levels on goods up to around 35%—the highest since the late 1800s. This would far surpass even the levels seen during the infamous Smoot-Hawley period, which historians widely blame for deepening the Great Depression. Trump's plan would reintroduce trade barriers at a scale unseen in over a century, despite a modern economy far more exposed to international commerce.The contrast between the two charts paints a stark picture: while the structure of the US economy has evolved to depend heavily on imports, Trump's proposed trade policy appears rooted in an era when international trade was minimal. Economists warn this disconnect could fuel inflation, disrupt industries, and lead to retaliation that hobbles both global and domestic growth.Trump’s long-promised “Liberation Day” speech will be watched for three key details:Universal or reciprocal? The White House remains split.Sectoral carveouts? Automobiles, steel, pharma, and semiconductors are in focus.Duration and flexibility. Will tariffs be negotiable or fixed for the long term?Inside the West Wing, factions are pushing different approaches. Some advocate a hard 20% universal tariff to send a signal. Others want a flexible structure to open room for bilateral negotiations.“With Trump, it’s all a negotiation,” said Sen. James Lankford. “This is like a kitchen remodel. It’s going to be noisy, but we know where we’re headed.”But others warn, “You don’t remodel the global economy with a hammer,” a European trade official quipped off record.Trump’s tariff plan is a bold gamble that could remake the global trading system — or plunge it into prolonged uncertainty. India finds itself in a rare position: not the target of the first strike, and possibly in line for modest trade gains.But as history warns, and the data confirms, no country is truly safe when tariffs become the world’s economic weapon of choice.","A worst-case global retaliation to Trump’s proposed 25% tariffs could hammer the world economy with a $1.4 trillion income hit.

SAN FRANCISCO: Today, creators of AI-enabled robotic systems for meal assembly Chef Robotics announced it has raised $43.1M in new Series A funding that includes $20.6M in equity and $22.5M in equipment financing debt; the latter will be used to cover the financing of Chef’s robotic systems for Robotics-as-a-Service (RaaS) so Chef’s customers don’t have to front CapEx for their robots.The equity round was led by Avataar Ventures and included investments from Construct Capital, Bloomberg Beta, Promus Ventures, MFV Partners, Interwoven, HCVC, MaC Venture Capital, Red and Blue Ventures, Tau Partners, Siddhi Capital, and BOLD Capital Partners. The new funding brings Chef’s total capital raised to $65.6M which consists of $38.8M in equity and $26.75M in equipment financing, all with Silicon Valley Bank, a Division of First Citizens Bank.Chef has quickly cemented its standing as the industry leader in AI-enabled robotics for meal assembly. Now at over 40M servings produced and counting through robot deployments at leading brands such as Amy’s Kitchen, Sunbasket, Chef Bombay, and Cafe Spice, Chef has procured more meals than all other existing food robotics startups combined. The data that Chef collects on each meal assembled is critical to the company as it relies on real-world production data to train its AI models.The funding round will allow Chef to accelerate production deployments of its robotic systems, providing momentum for the real-world AI data engine flywheel that the company credits for its rapid growth rate of meals produced. Given food is highly variable, Chef requires high volumes of production data over prolonged periods of time for optimal model performance. The more data Chef collects in the field, the more its systems' performance improves, the more customers use Chef’s robotic systems, the more customers expand; this expansion in turn creates more runtime in production leading to more data from the field; it also means that when Chef approaches new customers, Chef can help manipulate their ingredients from the get-go, further accelerating the flywheel’s momentum.“Robotics is really having a moment right now. The innovations in AI have unlocked the potential of Embodied AI for robotics. We believe we’re in the pole position to scale given all the real-world production training data we already have” says Rajat Bhageria, Founder and CEO of Chef Robotics.“AI in the physical world is happening right now with robotics. Food is one of the largest markets in the world. Industrial AI is already winning, and food packaging automation is quietly transforming how we get our meals. Chef has quickly cemented its standing as the industry leader in AI-enabled robotics for meal assembly at over 40M servings produced and counting.

Tesla and tech stocks lead declines

Global impact and rising fears



Stay informed with the latest business news, updates on bank holidays and public holidays.



As President Donald Trump’s ""Liberation Day"" approaches, stock markets around the world saw declines on Monday, driven by fears of the tariffs set to take effect on Wednesday. From Wall Street to Wellington, New Zealand, global markets faced significant sell-offs ahead of the impending economic moves.In the US, the S&P 500 dropped by 0.6%, following one of its most significant losses in recent years. The index is poised to close the first quarter of the year with a nearly 6% loss, which would make it the worst quarter in almost three years. While the S&P 500 managed to reduce some of its losses after an early 1.7% decline, the Nasdaq composite, heavily impacted by drops in Tesla, Nvidia, and other Big Tech stocks, plunged by 1.6%, according to news agency AP.The fall in US markets mirrored a global sell-off, as investors expressed concern that Trump’s upcoming tariffs would exacerbate inflation and slow global economic growth. The tariffs, set to be announced on Wednesday, are designed to match the tax burdens imposed by other nations on the US, with specifics still unclear. Trump has signalled that these moves are in part to bring more manufacturing jobs back to the USTrump's tariffs, designed to match trade barriers imposed by other countries on the U.S., are set to begin on Wednesday. The tariffs have raised concerns that they will increase inflation, potentially leading to a global recession. As uncertainty grows, major stock indices around the world have been hit hard.The S&P 500 dropped by 0.8%, contributing to its near 6% quarterly loss, which could mark the worst quarter in nearly three years. The Dow Jones Industrial Average showed resilience, edging up slightly by less than 0.1%, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 1.6%, weighed down by declines in major tech stocks like Tesla and Nvidia.In Asia, the Nikkei 225 in Japan suffered a significant 4.1% drop, while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng and China’s Shanghai Composite also saw losses. Europe was not immune either, with London’s FTSE 100, Paris’ CAC 40, and Frankfurt’s DAX all posting losses of over 1%.In the commodities market, oil prices showed signs of strength despite broader market declines:Gold and Bonds: As stocks fell, safe-haven assets like gold and U.S. Treasury bonds gained. Gold briefly topped $3,160 per ounce, while the yield on the 10-year Treasury dropped to 4.22% from 4.27% late Friday.Goldman Sachs economists have raised their forecast for inflation and lowered their U.S. growth projection, now predicting a 35% chance of a recession in the next year, up from 20% previously. The tariffs could further stoke inflationary pressures and hinder global economic growth, prompting businesses and consumers to scale back spending.The markets remain uncertain about what Trump’s tariffs will ultimately entail. While some analysts are optimistic that the tariffs might be less severe than feared, the continued unpredictability is likely to fuel volatility. Some also worry that the tariffs could add to global economic pain by reducing confidence and prompting businesses to cut jobs.Among the hardest-hit stocks were Tesla, which fell 4.7%, and Nvidia, which dropped 4.1%, as concerns about overvalued tech stocks lingered. Additionally, United Airlines and Delta Air Lines both saw losses, highlighting concerns that the broader economy might be cooling off.In mergers and acquisitions news, Mr. Cooper saw a significant rise of 16.6% after announcing its acquisition by Rocket Mortgage in a $9.4 billion deal.This worldwide sell-off reflects the growing concern over economic risks tied to the new tariffs, and investors are bracing for further market turbulence as Trump’s tariffs loom. The economic uncertainty surrounding this issue is likely to keep markets on edge, with analysts keeping a close eye on potential ripple effects throughout the global economy.","Trump's tariffs, designed to match trade barriers imposed by other countries on the U.S., are set to begin on Wednesday.

Expansion inertia

Other major Chinese developers report losses



Stay informed with the latest business news, updates on bank holidays and public holidays.



Hong Kong-listed property giant Vanke reported a significant annual loss of 49.5 billion yuan ($6.8 billion) on Monday, attributing the sharp decline to falling sales and shrinking profit margins despite efforts by Beijing to revive the struggling housing market.The company stated that 2024 had been an ""exceptionally challenging year,"" apologizing for the ""distress caused"" by the significant loss and ongoing pressure on liquidity, news agency AFP reported.Vanke acknowledged that it had “failed to break free from expansion inertia of high-debt, high-turnover and high-leverage in a timely manner,” which led to aggressive investment and over-expansion. This overextension contributed to the company’s substantial losses, marking Vanke’s first annual loss since it was listed in 1991. The firm’s loss exceeded its initial January estimate of $6.2 billion. Revenue also dropped by 26% year-on-year to $47.3 million.As part of the company’s ongoing reshuffling, Vanke’s Chief Operating Officer and Executive Vice President, Liu Xiao, resigned on Monday due to ""work adjustments."" The company confirmed that Liu will continue to work with the company, focusing on strategic investment business.The shakeup comes after the resignation of Vanke’s CEO, Zhu Jiusheng, in January due to health reasons. Reports from Chinese outlets suggested Zhu had been ""taken away by public security authorities,"" though the nature of the alleged offenses was unclear.Despite Beijing’s efforts to stabilize the property sector, including a policy package announced in November to lower deed tax rates in major cities like Beijing and Shanghai, Vanke faced a net loss of $4.35 billion in the final quarter of 2024. The company warned of intensified liquidity pressure due to concentrated repayment obligations on its public debts this year. Chinese authorities are reportedly considering plans to help Vanke plug a $6.8 billion funding gap this year.Vanke is not the only property developer facing financial troubles. Kaisa, another troubled developer, reported a 48.4% increase in losses to $4.03 billion for 2024. Country Garden also reported a $4.5 billion annual loss, with total debt reaching $34.9 billion at the end of 2024.Vanke’s struggles are part of a broader crisis in China’s real estate sector, which has been dealing with a massive debt burden and severe financial distress for many developers.","Hong Kong-listed property giant Vanke reported a significant annual loss of 49.5 billion yuan ($6.8 billion) on Monday.

Rocket Companies to acquire Mr Cooper in $9.4 billion all-stock deal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/rocket-companies-to-acquire-mr-cooper-in-9-4-billion-all-stock-deal/articleshow/119811298.cms,"Rocket companies (Photo-AP)

Rocket Mortgage is acquiring competitor Mr. Cooper in an all-stock deal valued at $9.4 billion, shortly after its acquisition of real estate listing company Redfin.The merger will create a combined entity handling one in every six mortgages in the US, adding nearly 7 million new clients to Rocket’s portfolio. This strategic move is expected to increase loan volumes and lower customer acquisition costs, news agency AP reported.Jay Bray, Chairman and CEO of Mr. Cooper, who will become President and CEO of Rocket Mortgage, stated, “By combining Mr. Cooper and Rocket, we will form the strongest mortgage company in the industry, offering an end-to-end homeownership experience backed by leading technology and grounded in customer care.”The US housing market has been in a slump, with soaring mortgage rates and high prices putting homeownership out of reach for many. Companies like Rocket are responding by building a more comprehensive, one-stop experience for potential homebuyers.Under the terms of the deal, Mr. Cooper shareholders will receive a fixed exchange ratio of 11 Rocket shares for each share of Mr. Cooper common stock. Upon completion, Rocket shareholders will own approximately 75% of the combined company, while Mr. Cooper stockholders will own 25%. The combined company’s board will consist of 11 members, with nine from Rocket and two from Mr. Cooper.Earlier this month, Rocket also announced its acquisition of Redfin in an all-stock deal valued at $1.75 billion. Redfin, founded in 2004, offers over 1 million for-sale and rental listings on its platform.The National Association of Realtors reported a 4.2% increase in existing home sales in February, partly driven by easing mortgage rates and more properties available on the market. However, home sales began to decline in 2022 when mortgage rates started rising from pandemic-era lows, and last year, sales of previously owned US homes fell to their lowest level in nearly 30 years",Rocket Mortgage is acquiring competitor Mr. Cooper in an all-stock deal valued at $9.4 billion.

Can Trump’s auto tariffs save Musk's Tesla from BYD?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/can-trumps-auto-tariffs-save-musks-tesla-from-byd/articleshow/119809239.cms,"Created with ChatGPT 4

Why it matters

Tariffs may not stop BYD’s global takeover: Tesla may be protected in the US market, but China’s BYD — now the world’s top EV seller — is aggressively expanding into Europe, Southeast Asia, and Latin America, where Tesla is losing ground.

Tesla may be protected in the US market, but China’s BYD — now the world’s top EV seller — is aggressively expanding into Europe, Southeast Asia, and Latin America, where Tesla is losing ground. Tesla’s international brand is under siege: Elon Musk’s close alignment with President Trump is fueling backlash abroad. From EU protests to Canadian subsidy cuts, Tesla is facing a reputational crisis that no tariff can fix.

Elon Musk’s close alignment with President Trump is fueling backlash abroad. From EU protests to Canadian subsidy cuts, Tesla is facing a reputational crisis that no tariff can fix. The China EV threat isn’t theoretical — it’s here: BYD’s latest innovations, like 5-minute ultra-fast charging and advanced hybrids, are reshaping consumer expectations. Tesla is no longer the undisputed tech leader in the electric vehicle race.

— it’s here: BYD’s latest innovations, like 5-minute ultra-fast charging and advanced hybrids, are reshaping consumer expectations. Tesla is no longer the undisputed tech leader in the electric vehicle race. Trump’s tariffs could backfire long-term: By disrupting the global EV supply chain — especially battery components from Japan and South Korea — the tariffs risk undermining the very infrastructure the US needs to compete with China.

By disrupting the global EV supply chain — especially battery components from Japan and South Korea — the tariffs risk undermining the very infrastructure the US needs to compete with China. US consumers could take a financial hit: Goldman Sachs estimates the tariffs could raise car prices by $5,000 to $15,000. That narrows the price gap between Tesla EVs and cheaper gas-powered vehicles, threatening demand at home.

The big picture

What they’re saying

Long term I think Tesla stock’s going to do fine, so maybe it’s a buying opportunity. Elon Musk

Between the lines

1. Tariffs hurt Tesla’s rivals far more than Tesla

2. Tesla’s political baggage is building

3. China’s EV rise isn’t accidental

What’s next

Global dominance is slipping from Musk’s hands. Tesla is still a major force, but it’s no longer the inevitable EV champion. With Chinese competitors innovating faster and scaling cheaper, Musk’s global strategy needs a reboot.

Trump’s tariffs are a double-edged sword. While they buy Tesla time in the US, they risk dismantling the global non-China EV supply chain — which includes Korean and Japanese battery makers essential to Tesla’s long-term competitiveness.

BYD’s global march continues. Consumers can’t buy BYD vehicles in the US — yet. But elsewhere, they’re exploding. BYD has nailed pricing, design, and infrastructure.

Tesla’s future isn’t guaranteed. Protectionism may offer short-term relief, but it won’t stop the global EV shift already underway. And in that race, China — not the US — is in the driver’s seat.

Trade policy can shape short-term winners. But the bigger game—technological leadership, market share, and brand trust—is still very much in play.

And in that game, Tesla is not the only player anymore. It may not even be the favorite.

US President Donald Trump ’s sweeping 25% tariff on all imported vehicles and parts is a windfall for Elon Musk’s Tesla — at least on American soil. But it may prove meaningless against the rising global threat posed by China’s electric vehicle juggernaut, BYD.In the US, Tesla is now the least exposed major carmaker to Trump’s new trade policy. The EV giant produces every car it sells in the US at massive factories in California and Texas. This domestic manufacturing footprint helps Musk sidestep the very tariffs that are clobbering rivals like GM, Toyota, and Hyundai, whose global supply chains cross numerous borders.But this insulation only applies inside the US. Tesla’s real danger is coming from abroad, where BYD is moving ahead.In late 2024, BYD leapfrogged Tesla in global EV sales and revenue, crossing the $100 billion mark. Backed early on by Warren Buffett and powered by aggressive tech innovation, BYD now poses the clearest threat Musk has ever faced. The company unveiled a new EV charging system that delivers 400 kilometers of range in just five minutes — an innovation Tesla has yet to match.As per a report in Asia Times, Elon Musk saw it coming. In early 2024, he warned that without tariffs, Chinese EV makers would “demolish” global rivals. “Chinese car companies are the most competitive car companies in the world,” he told shareholders. “If there are no trade barriers established, they will pretty much demolish most other car companies in the world.”""Tesla a relative beneficiary given 100% US production footprint, substantial US sourcing and with Model Y competing in a midsize crossover segment where close to 50% of vehicles could be subject to tariffs,” TD Cowen’s Itay Michaeli told Asia Times.Analysts are taking note. “Tesla is the least exposed auto giant,” says CFRA Research’s Garrett Nelson, citing the company’s US-based production and sourcing. Deutsche Bank agrees: “Tesla and Ford appear to be the most shielded from tariff impacts,” though Ford still faces risks from imported engines.But even as Tesla enjoys short-term protection, Musk’s long-term problem is not going away — and it’s not just BYD. Chinese EV startups like XPeng, Nio, and Zeekr are rising fast, especially in emerging markets where cost matters more than brand identity, the Asia Times report said.The 25% tariff is expected to raise car prices in the US by $5,000 to $15,000 depending on the model, according to Goldman Sachs. That’s a sharp blow to companies like Hyundai and Toyota, which import a significant portion of their vehicles to the US despite also having American factories.General Motors is also in the tariff crosshairs. Roughly 40% of GM’s US sales are from vehicles built in Mexico or Canada. GM also imports key models like the Equinox and Trax — meaning it will have to either absorb the cost or pass it to consumers.European brands, especially Germany’s Volkswagen and Italy’s Stellantis, are even more exposed. These companies were betting on US growth to offset slumping sales in China — and Trump’s tariffs could derail that pivot.Musk’s role as head of Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has sparked massive backlash. Protesters are now regularly demonstrating outside Tesla showrooms in the US and Europe, with signs comparing Musk to fascist leaders and labeling his vehicles “Swasticars.”“Hey, hey, ho, ho, Elon Musk has got to go!” chanted several dozen protesters outside a Tesla showroom in Dublin, California—roughly 35 miles east of San Francisco—as a small group of Trump supporters stood across the street waving American flags, an AP report said.In nearby Berkeley, a larger crowd surrounded another Tesla location, chanting to the rhythm of drums. “We're living in a fascist state,” said Dennis Fagaly, a retired high school teacher from Oakland. “And we need to stop this or we'll lose our whole country and everything that is good about the United States.”In February alone, Tesla registrations in the EU dropped 47%. In New York, lawmakers are pushing to divest state pension funds from Tesla stock. In Canada, several provinces have pulled Tesla from EV rebate programs.Tesla is in the middle of what one analyst called a “brand tornado crisis.” “This continues to be a moment of truth for Musk to navigate this brand tornado crisis moment and get onto the other side of this dark chapter for Tesla,” Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives wrote in a recent research note, said the AP report.Tesla constitutes a large part of Musk's wealth. It's the Tesla that helped Musk become the world's wealthiest person. But Musk runs the risk of losing a part of his fortune due to his political activism. Even Musk has admitted, “It’s costing me a lot to be in this job,” referencing the blowback from his Trump alliance and his role at DOGE.Trump may be loud about tariffs, but China has quietly mastered them for decades. As Michael Dunne explains, “China’s love affair with tariffs—quiet, almost clandestine—has been going on for decades.” Through a mix of heavy import taxes, limited licenses, and industrial policy, Beijing built an auto empire.In 2024, China produced 31 million vehicles — three times more than the US. Despite being the world's largest auto market, it has never allowed car imports to exceed 6% of the domestic market.This fortress model is what allowed BYD and others to grow into global players. Now, they’re scaling internationally — exactly as Tesla begins to stumble.(With inputs from agencies)","’“It’s here: I’m not going to tell you how long it will be, but it may be a long time before you know what it is going to be.” “I’ll be the first to say that I don’t know how long this will be the longest.’ “It may be as long as it takes me to say how long I think it will take me to get to the next place I am going to go.� ‘I�’ve been thinking about it for a","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119811599,imgsize-902194,width-400,resizemode-4/119811599.jpg"

While the details remain vague, the stakes are high for American families, businesses, and the global economy.Trump plans to impose import taxes , including “reciprocal” tariffs that match rates imposed by other countries and account for subsidies. Target nations include the European Union, South Korea, Brazil, and India, according to new agency AP.“This is the beginning of Liberation Day in America,” Trump announced. “We’re going to charge countries for doing business here and taking our jobs, our wealth, and a lot more.”Trump’s tariffs could cover a wide range of products, including:While Trump claims these tariffs will spur domestic investments, he also hints at potential negotiations to ease the taxes once agreements are reached.Most economists warn that these tariffs could hurt the US economy:Economist Art Laffer estimates the auto tariffs could add $4,711 to the cost of each vehicle. Goldman Sachs predicts US economic growth will slow to just 0.6% this quarter, down from 2.4% at the end of last year.Columbus Mayor Andrew Ginther warned that tariffs could raise median home costs by $21,000, making affordability a bigger issue.Some officials argue tariffs will be a one-time price adjustment, but others fear retaliation from other countries could trigger an inflationary spiral.The international community has reacted strongly:Trump’s use of the term isn’t new. He previously referred to:For Trump, tariffs are not just economic tools—they represent a symbolic fight for America’s sovereignty and prosperity.However, critics argue that the consequences of this “Liberation Day” will likely include economic turmoil, higher consumer costs, and strained international relations.“I don’t see anything positive about Liberation Day,” said Phillip Braun, a finance professor at Northwestern University. “It’s going to hurt the US economy, and other countries will retaliate.”","Trump plans to impose import taxes, including “reciprocal” tariffs that match rates imposed by other countries.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Space sector start-up Sisir Radar to develop SAR on L/P band SAR,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/space-sector-start-up-sisir-radar-to-develop-sar-on-l/p-band-sar/articleshow/104558111.cms,"CHENNAI: Space sector startup, Sisir Radar Private Ltd has hit success at the prestigious iDEX DefSpace Challenge with its projects for development of “L/P band Continuous Wave SAR (synthetic aperture radar) payload for LEO Small Satellites” and “Unfurlable, Electronically Steering Antenna for L/P band SAR payload” for Indian Air Force (IAF), said a top company official.The company is promoted by former Director at the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) Tapan Misra and the brains behind the Indian space agency’s RISAT series of SAR satellites as well as the Dual Frequency SAR on the Chandrayaan 2 orbiter that is currently circling the moon.""A grant of Rs 3 crore is also there for development of the products,"" Misra told IANS.Synthetic Aperture Radar or SAR is a special kind of imaging radar technology that can provide extremely accurate high resolution imagery of the terrain through clouds, smoke and dust even in pitch dark conditions. SAR imagery provides much higher resolution than other forms of remote sensing technology such as hyperspectral and multispectral. SAR is a critical technology for strategic reconnaissance and planning as well as for disaster management.According to Misra, winning the challenge in just over a year of floating the company is a major booster.He said L and P band SAR have an advantage over other frequencies (like X band) when it comes to penetration capabilities through rain, clouds, foliage and vegetation in a tropical country like India, and underground penetration capabilities in dry terrain.Continuing further, he said the L band SAR will provide 1 metre resolution, spotlight resolution in Stripmap mode. The current industry standard is 5-10 metre in L band. Misra said both the L and P band will operate simultaneously from a satellite borne SAR. Recently, Sisir Radar successfully developed and tested the world’s highest resolution L-Band SAR fitted on a drone. With 0.2 metre resolution, this is by far the highest L band SAR in the world, he said.","Space sector startup, Sisir Radar Private Ltd has hit success at the prestigious iDEX DefSpace Challenge.

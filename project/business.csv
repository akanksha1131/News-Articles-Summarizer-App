Pumping up production

Chinese electronics component makers are offering price reductions of up to 5% to Indian companies as part of new sourcing contract negotiations, driven by concerns over the US trade conflict. US President Donald Trump has slapped a whopping 125% tariff on Chinese goods after China announced retaliatory tariffs.The US-China trade dispute has considerably reduced new orders to Chinese manufacturers, as global supply networks adjust to reciprocal tariffs, with the US imposing the highest rate of 125% on Chinese goods. The decreased American demand for Chinese electronics will also affect component requirements.The discounts being offered by Chinese companies are a substantial concession in an industry with slim 4-7% profit margins, according to an ET report. This could potentially allow Indian manufacturers to increase their profits by 2-3%, according to television, refrigerator and smartphone producers. Indian companies might transfer some cost benefits to customers to enhance sales.Chinese imports constitute approximately 75% of all electronics components used in Indian manufacturing.""Component manufacturers in China are under pressure,"" said Kamal Nandi, head of the appliance business at Godrej Enterprises Group. ""Prices will be renegotiated as export orders from the US slow down.""The electronics sector typically maintains raw material stocks for two to three months. Companies will initiate new orders from May-June onwards. According to a recent GTRI report, India's electronics component imports in FY24 increased by 36.7% to $34.4 billion compared to the previous year. Over five years, imports grew by 118.2% from $15.8 billion in FY19.Also Read | Apple looks to manufacture more iPhones in India as Trump’s tariffs hit China harder: Report Chinese manufacturers are experiencing surplus issues, according to Avneet Singh Marwah, chief executive of television contract manufacturer Super Plastronics.""There is panic.

""However, since domestic demand in India is not robust, companies may pass some as discounts."" In 2024, electrical and electronic equipment represented the largest segment of US imports from China, amounting to $127.06 billion.Chinese suppliers are encountering reduced demand in India due to production-linked incentives, quality control orders (QCOs) requiring Bureau of Indian Standards approval for overseas sourcing, and increasing import duties on components, which have promoted local manufacturing. The India Cellular and Electronics Association projects domestic components and sub-assembly manufacturing to reach $145-155 billion by 2030, following the government's announcement of the Electronics Component Manufacturing Scheme on Tuesday.

Malaysian furniture exporters scramble to meet US demand before Trump’s 90 day tariff window closes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/malaysian-furniture-exporters-scramble-to-meet-us-demand-before-trumps-90-day-tariff-window-closes/articleshow/120229588.cms,"Photo credit - AP

Furniture manufacturers in southern Malaysia are rushing to fulfil orders for American customers, racing against time as they prepare for a potential tariff hike under former US President Donald Trump’s trade policy.Trump, who has proposed a 24% tariff on all imports from Malaysia, announced this week that most countries would instead receive a 10% rate for a 90-day period. Exporters in Malaysia have interpreted the move as a countdown to maximize shipments before steeper duties take effect, the Associated Press reported.In Muar, a major furniture production hub in Johor state, workers at factories were operating at full tilt Friday. The city is central to Malaysia’s furniture industry, and the United States is its largest export market — accounting for around 60% of total exports, according to AP.At the Corporate Specialist kitchen furniture factory, workers loaded container after container bound for the US“We are working overtime now and trying our best to motivate our workers, because these 3 months will be very busy,” said Chief Financial Officer Peihing Tsai, speaking to the AP.Tsai noted that in the past four days alone, the factory had shipped more than 30 containers — the same volume it typically sends in a month.Trump’s proposed tariffs could raise costs on a wide range of imported goods, including mobile phones, apparel, and furniture. Analysts say the move could mark the end of an era of low-cost consumer products that Americans have benefited from for decades.Tsai expressed concern that if tariffs rise above 10%, US distributors might abandon Malaysian manufacturers. But relocating production to the United States isn’t a viable solution. “The cost is astronomical,” Tsai told AP. “The increased price will have to be borne by our end consumers.”Candice Lim, general manager of furniture producer Natural Signature, suggested Trump’s tariff threats were more a negotiation tactic than a long-term policy shift.“It is unlikely to go on in this way,” she said in an interview with AP. “Otherwise, how can the American people stand it?”The next three months, manufacturers say, could prove crucial in shaping the future of Malaysia’s US -focused furniture trade.",US President Donald Trump has proposed a 24% tariff on all imports from Malaysia.

UK lawmakers approve rescue of British Steel in emergency parliamentary session,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/uk-lawmakers-approve-rescue-of-british-steel-in-emergency-parliamentary-session/articleshow/120237909.cms,"Photo credit - AP

In a rare emergency session on Saturday, UK lawmakers cut short their Easter break to pass legislation rescuing the country's last fully integrated steel plant from imminent closure.Prime Minister Keir Starmer called the extraordinary session — only the sixth of its kind since World War II — to pass a bill aimed at halting plans by British Steel’s Chinese owner, Jingye Group, to shutter the two blast furnaces at the Scunthorpe plant in northern England.The legislation grants sweeping powers to Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds, enabling him to direct British Steel’s board, secure pay for the plant’s 3,000 workers, and order raw materials needed to keep the furnaces running. Without immediate action, the blast furnaces — critical for producing virgin steel — risked a permanent shutdown due to canceled orders and lack of essential inputs like iron pellets and coking coal.Jingye has argued the plant is losing £700,000 ($910,000) daily, citing global market pressures and rising environmental compliance costs. The company said recent tariffs from U.S. President Donald Trump — including a 25% levy on foreign steel — have worsened the situation.Following Parliament's approval of the rescue plan, Starmer traveled to Scunthorpe to meet with steelworkers, whose jobs — and the town's 150-year-old steelmaking legacy — now appear safe, at least for the short term.“You and your colleagues for years have been the backbone of British Steel,” Starmer told workers. “It’s your jobs, your lives, your communities, your families.”Relief swept the town, even spilling into Scunthorpe United’s soccer match, where steelworkers were welcomed on the field with cheers. The local club’s nickname, “The Iron,” stands as a tribute to the town's industrial roots.The blast furnaces are not just vital to Scunthorpe — they represent the UK’s last capacity to produce steel from raw materials. Without them, the nation would become the only G7 country unable to make its own virgin steel, leaving industries like defense, infrastructure, and rail reliant on foreign sources.“We could not, will not and never will stand idly by while heat seeps from the UK’s remaining blast furnaces without any planning, any due process or any respect for the consequences,” Reynolds said in Parliament. He accused Jingye of making “excessive” demands during negotiations and warned that without intervention, the company was on track to “irrevocably and unilaterally” shut down primary steelmaking.Though the new law does not nationalize British Steel, Reynolds acknowledged that a future transfer of ownership to the state remains on the table. It also raises uncertainty over Jingye’s role going forward. Should the company fail to comply with the law, it and its executives could face legal action.British Steel, acquired by Jingye in 2020, has yet to comment on how it will respond to the government’s move.","UK lawmakers cut short their Easter break to pass legislation rescuing the country's last fully integrated steel plant from imminent closure.

Trump’s tariff rattles US importers; Woldenberg’s CEO calls it 'end of days',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/trumps-tariff-rattles-us-importers-woldenbergs-ceo-calls-it-end-of-days/articleshow/120232687.cms,"Photo- AP

US businesses that rely heavily on Chinese manufacturing are reeling after former President Donald Trump imposed sweeping new tariffs on imports from China — raising them to an unprecedented 145% in retaliation for what he called unfair trade practices.As reported by the Associated Press, the dramatic tariff hikes — rolled out unpredictably and at speed — have stunned American importers. Rick Woldenberg, CEO of Learning Resources, a Chicago-area educational toy company, said he planned for a 40% tariff hike but was blindsided when the rate jumped more than threefold.Woldenberg’s company, which has made products in China for four decades, now faces an estimated $100 million tariff bill for 2025, up from $2.3 million last year. “Honest to God, no exaggeration: It feels like the end of days,” he told AP.Trump’s tariff escalation follows years of rising tensions between the US and China and is part of his push to bring manufacturing back to American soil. However, industry leaders argue that US infrastructure and labour markets are not equipped to replace China’s manufacturing capacity overnight.According to AP, China still dominates key consumer sectors — supplying 97% of America’s imported baby carriages, 96% of umbrellas, 95% of fireworks, and 90% of combs.Businesses that built their supply chains around Chinese factories now face an uncertain future. “American consumers created China,” said Joe Jurken of the ABC Group, which helps US firms manage Asian supply chains. “They got addicted to cheap pricing.”The tariffs are already having ripple effects:MGA Entertainment, maker of L.O.L. and Bratz dolls, says the price of some toys could double by the holiday season. CEO Isaac Larian told AP the tariffs are forcing the company to cut orders and reduce Chinese sourcing from 65% to 40%.The Edge Desk, a furniture startup, has scrapped production plans in China due to the tariffs and is now looking at Germany and Italy for manufacturing, despite higher costs.Even US -based brands like Little Tikes are affected because they depend on components sourced from China, highlighting how deeply integrated global supply chains have become.Trump has also signaled that other manufacturing hubs like India, Vietnam, and Cambodia could face similar tariffs after a 90-day grace period, further shaking global business confidence.The Associated Press noted that the White House initially said tariffs on Chinese goods would be 125%, before correcting the figure to 145% — including a previously announced 20% levy aimed at pressuring China over the fentanyl crisis.China responded by slapping its own 125% tariffs on US goods, effective Saturday.The unpredictability of the policy rollout is as damaging as the tariffs themselves, business owners say. “There is so much uncertainty,” Larian told AP. “And no business can run on uncertainty.”The economic toll could be significant. The Yale Budget Lab estimates that Trump’s tariffs could reduce US GDP growth by 1.1 percentage points in 2025. Inflation expectations are also climbing — the University of Michigan’s latest survey shows consumers now expect long-term inflation of 4.4%.For Woldenberg, the impact is both financial and existential. His company’s 10,000 molds, installed in Chinese factories over decades, are not easily relocated. “It’s not like you just bring in a canvas bag, zip it up and walk out,” he said.“There is no idle US manufacturing hub, full of skilled engineers, waiting to pick up this work,” Woldenberg told AP. “In an instant, snap of a finger, they’re kaput.”","US businesses that rely heavily on Chinese manufacturing are reeling after former President Donald Trump imposed sweeping new tariffs on imports from China.

"India, 62 nations back global carbon tax on shipping at UN maritime meet",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/india-62-nations-back-global-carbon-tax-on-shipping-at-un-maritime-meet/articleshow/120231825.cms,"Photo - AP

India joined 62 other nations in voting in favour of the world’s first-ever global carbon tax on the shipping industry, a landmark decision adopted by the United Nations’ shipping agency in London on Friday, PTI reported.The measure, passed after a week of intense negotiations at the International Maritime Organisation (IMO), aims to cut greenhouse gas emissions from ships and accelerate the transition to cleaner maritime technologies. The tax is set to take effect from 2028 and marks the first time a global carbon pricing mechanism has been imposed on an entire industry.Under the new framework, ships will either have to switch to low-emission fuels or pay a fee based on the level of pollution they produce. According to estimates, the tax could generate up to USD 40 billion by 2030.While hailed as a significant step forward for global climate policy, the agreement has also drawn criticism for failing to address the climate finance needs of developing and vulnerable nations. All funds raised will be used exclusively for decarbonising the shipping sector and will not be allocated to broader climate adaptation or loss and damage efforts.The pricing mechanism is expected to reduce shipping emissions by just 10% by 2030 — well below the IMO’s own target of at least 20%, PTI noted.India, along with China, Brazil and 60 other nations, voted in favour of the deal. However, several oil-rich nations, including Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Russia, and Venezuela, opposed the move. Notably, the United States delegation did not take part in the negotiations and was absent during the final vote.A coalition of over 60 countries — primarily from the Pacific, Caribbean, Africa, and Central America — had advocated for part of the revenue to be directed toward broader climate finance needs. These countries, many of them highly vulnerable to rising sea levels and extreme weather, voiced disappointment with the outcome.Tuvalu, speaking on behalf of the Pacific Island nations, criticised the lack of transparency in the talks and said the framework does not sufficiently incentivise a shift to clean fuels.Vanuatu’s Minister for Climate Change, Ralph Regenvanu, accused fossil fuel-producing countries like Saudi Arabia and the US of obstructing stronger measures that could have aligned shipping with the 1.5°C temperature limit outlined in the Paris Agreement.Under the adopted system, ships will be taxed according to the intensity of their emissions. In 2028, vessels using traditional fuels will pay USD 380 per tonne for the most polluting emissions and USD 100 per tonne for emissions exceeding set thresholds. The tax will be introduced in stages, progressively discouraging the use of fossil fuels, including liquefied natural gas.Though the overarching framework has been agreed upon, technical details — including the final structure for revenue use and distribution — are yet to be finalised. The policy is expected to be formally adopted in October 2025, PTI said.Environmental groups and representatives from smaller nations have pledged to continue advocating for a more equitable and ambitious framework.Laurence Tubiana, CEO of the European Climate Foundation and a key architect of the Paris Agreement, welcomed the IMO’s move as a step in the right direction. “Polluters must pay for the damage they cause to the climate,” she said, but also called the agreement inadequate, noting the absence of a dedicated shipping levy. “This was a missed opportunity,” she added, pointing to growing global support for taxing high-polluting sectors and the ultra-wealthy.","India joined 62 other nations in voting in favour of the world’s first-ever global carbon tax on the shipping industry. The measure aims to cut greenhouse gas emissions from ships and accelerate the transition to cleaner maritime technologies. According to estimates, the tax could generate up to USD 40 billion by 2030.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120231971,imgsize-590103,width-400,resizemode-4/120231971.jpg"
Foot-and-mouth disease outbreak prompts mass animal culls and border closures in Central Europe,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/foot-and-mouth-disease-outbreak-prompts-mass-animal-culls-and-border-closures-in-central-europe/articleshow/120229179.cms,"Photo credit- AP

Authorities across Central Europe are scrambling to contain an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease that has led to the culling of thousands of animals and prompted border closures between Hungary, Slovakia, and Austria.The outbreak was first detected in early March on a cattle farm in northwestern Hungary. Within weeks, cases were confirmed on three farms in neighboring Slovakia, as reported news agency AP. Additional infections have since been reported on three more farms in both Hungary and Slovakia — marking the first known outbreak of the disease in either country in over 50 years.Sándor Szoboszlai, a local entrepreneur and hunter in the Hungarian town of Levél — where nearly 3,000 cattle were culled — described the chaos the outbreak has caused. ""Everything is completely upside down,"" Szoboszlai told the Associated Press. “We didn’t even think such a thing could happen. Who could count on that? Nobody.”Foot-and-mouth disease is a highly contagious viral illness that primarily affects cloven-hooved animals, including cattle, pigs, goats, sheep, and deer. Though it poses little risk to humans, the disease can spread rapidly via direct contact, contaminated surfaces, or even through the air.In Hungary, disinfection operations are ongoing, with authorities placing chemical-soaked mats at the entrances and exits of affected towns in an attempt to prevent the spread of the virus. However, many of the mats have proven ineffective, drying out quickly or being swept aside by passing vehicles, AP observed.The Slovakian government has responded by closing 16 of its border crossings with Hungary and one with Austria, citing inadequate containment efforts by Hungarian authorities. Austria, which has not reported any infections, closed 23 crossings with Hungary and Slovakia last week.The Czech Republic, while further removed from the outbreak's epicenter, has imposed disinfection protocols at all five major border crossings for freight trucks entering the country.Jiri Cerny, an associate professor at the Czech University of Life Sciences in Prague, told the AP that the disease is most likely to spread through contaminated human objects — including vehicle tires, footwear, and food.Czech Agriculture Minister Marek Výborný stated that border restrictions could be lifted 30 days after the last infected animal is culled in Slovakia.In Hungary, no new infections have been confirmed this week. Agricultural Minister István Nagy told reporters Friday that disinfection efforts at the final infected sites are expected to be completed by Saturday.Earlier in the week, Hungarian official Gergely Gulyás, chief of staff to Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, raised concerns that the outbreak might have been caused by “an artificially produced virus,” suggesting a possible “biological attack.” Gulyás did not provide evidence for the claim, which he said was based on preliminary verbal assessments from a foreign laboratory analyzing samples.The Hungarian government has pledged to support affected farmers with financial aid, including a moratorium on loan payments and compensation for lost livestock.Szoboszlai, the Levél resident, became emotional when discussing the impact on a local farmer whose entire herd was culled. “I feel so sorry for him, because this is his life's work,” he said. “It will be very difficult to start over.""","Foot-and-mouth disease has led to the culling of thousands of animals in Hungary, Slovakia, and Austria.

RBI proposes new route for offloading bad loans,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/rbi-proposes-new-route-for-offloading-bad-loans/articleshow/120217704.cms,"MUMBAI: RBI has proposed a new route for banks and NBFCs to offload bad loans, allowing them to bundle and sell stressed assets directly to investors through special purpose entities set up by regulated financial firms. Until now, only asset reconstruction companies handled such assets. The move, announced with the April monetary policy, is intended to broaden the market for distressed debt and reduce dependence on ARCs.A key feature is the appointment of resolution managers, tasked with recovering value from the underlying assets. These must be independent of the originating lender. For such loans, RBI-regulated entities can act as resolution managers. For others, insolvency professionals and regulated institutions may qualify. Lenders must gradually provision for the securitised notes over five years. Capital requirements vary with recovery ratings, favoring senior tranches. Any exposure left after five years is to be marked down to Re 1.With the new dispensation, ARCs may lose some of their market. Larger cases are presently going to the NARCL, and the new framework will now allow lenders to bypass ARCs for mid-sized and retail loans. RBI has also mandated that ARCs must raise their net owned fund to Rs 300 crore by FY26, a threshold many have yet to meet. The new framework retains a key principle of RBI's regulations on bad loans that are aimed at preventing defaulters getting control of their assets through the back door.","Until now, only asset reconstruction companies handled such assets.

A 90-day pause on ""reciprocal tariffs"" has been granted to most countries, but not to China, which responded by imposing its own 125 per cent tariff on US imports.According to PTI, the ongoing tariff war is causing widespread reorientation of supply chains. Vietnamese exports are being redirected away from the US , Mexico and China, with notable increases to the EU, Korea, and Middle East and North Africa (MENA) regions.ALSO READ | Trump’s tariff rattles US importers; Woldenberg’s CEO calls it 'end of days' Coke-Hamilton cited the apparel sector as a key example. “Textiles is a top industry in terms of economic activity and employment for developing countries,” she said. Bangladesh, the world’s second-largest apparel exporter, would be hit with a 37 per cent reciprocal tariff if US measures proceed, potentially slashing $3.3 billion from its annual US exports by 2029.S he added that for developing nations to withstand such shocks—be it from trade policy shifts, pandemics, or climate disasters—they must prioritise diversification, value addition, and regional integration.“There are opportunities for developing countries not just to navigate times of uncertainty, but to proactively prepare for the long haul,” she said.Early economic modelling, developed with the French economics research institute CEPII, indicates that even before the latest wave of tariffs and China’s countermeasures, global GDP could be reduced by 0.7 per cent by 2040. Countries such as Mexico, China, Thailand, and nations in Southern Africa are among the most affected, along with the United States itself.Meanwhile, the Asia Society Policy Institute (ASPI) in Washington has warned of broader geopolitical implications. Wendy Cutler, ASPI Vice President and Managing Director, said, “With China’s announcement of further tariff hikes against US imports, it’s clear that hopes that China would blink first in this trade war are misplaced. China is in for the long haul.”Cutler noted that while Beijing may have reached the limit of symmetrical tariff retaliation, it likely has “other tools in its arsenal” that could be activated if tensions escalate.“The steep tariffs now in place—145 per cent for Chinese imports into the US and 125 per cent for US imports to China—virtually halt all goods trade between the two largest economies in the world,” she said.ASPI’s Vice President of International Security and Diplomacy, Daniel Russel, said Chinese President Xi Jinping is staying calm amid the crisis, waiting for Trump’s tariff policy to falter under domestic pressure.“He’s betting that Trump’s tariff tantrum will collapse under the weight of the US market response,” Russel said. “By declaring it will ‘ignore’ future US tariff hikes, Beijing is not trying to win the trade war—it’s trying to outlast it and outmanoeuvre Trump.”Russel added that China is pursuing a longer-term strategic advantage by shoring up ties with Southeast Asia, expanding its diplomatic clout, and subtly pressuring US allies. “Xi’s Southeast Asia tour is part of a strategy to reinforce economic partnerships while Washington lashes out and alienates its partners,” he said.","US President Donald Trump's aggressive tariff hikes are likely to cause long- term disruptions in international commerce and economic integration.

Investors dumped US government bonds, the dollar tumbled and stocks seesawed Friday, capping a volatile week as President Donald Trump 's unpredictable tariff policy rattled market confidence.Trump triggered a massive market sell-off last week by announcing universal tariffs, and this week he sparked a huge but short-lived rally by pausing higher duties against scores of countries.But he kept China in his crosshairs, hitting Chinese goods with a 145 percent tariff.Beijing said Friday that it would hit back with 125 percent duties on American products, but suggested it would not retaliate further in the future.Wall Street indexes opened in the red Friday but rose shortly thereafter as investors sought to make sense of the latest trade war news, with the broad-based S&P 500 edging up 0.3 percent around midday.European markets also had a roller-coaster trading day, with Frankfurt closing 0.9 percent lower and Paris down 0.3 percent. London rose 0.6 as data showed the UK economy grew far more than expected in February.""The main driver of the renewed market pressure was an increased focus on the US-China escalation,"" said Jim Reid, managing director at Deutsche Bank.""Neither the US nor China are showing signs of backing down, with President Trump expressing confidence in his tariff plans,"" Reid said.The dollar plunged to its lowest level against the euro in more than three years as investors fled what is typically considered a key haven currency, though it later pared some of its losses.In a more worrying sign of cracking investor confidence in the US economy, the yield on the 10-year US Treasury bill rose sharply to 4.5 percent as its price tumbled.John Higgins, chief markets economist at Capital Economics, said it was a sign of ""concern that China might dump its vast holdings of Treasuries"" even if that risked losses for Beijing and driving the yuan higher against the dollar.With Treasuries being sold off, sending their yields higher and making US debt more expensive, there is a fear of a bigger exodus from American assets down the line.JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon on Friday rejected the notion that US Treasuries were no longer a haven.""If you're going to invest your money in something, America is still a pretty, pretty good place in this turbulent world,"" Dimon said in a conference call after his bank reported hefty first-quarter profits and revenue.The weaker dollar and the rush for safety sent gold to a record high above $3,220 an ounce.Oil prices rose slightly after huge falls on Thursday.""There remains considerable uncertainty around the impact of tariffs on economies and company earnings, and that could keep markets volatile for some time,"" said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell.Investors were also turning to more routine economic and business data, with the release of inflation data and corporate earnings.Official figures showed US producer inflation fell sharply last month before the tariffs took effect.JPMorgan Chase reported first-quarter profits of $14.6 billion, up nine percent from the period last year.In Asia, the Tokyo stock market shed three percent -- a day after surging more than nine percent -- while Sydney and Seoul were also in the red.Hong Kong and Shanghai rose as traders focused on possible Chinese stimulus measures.There were gains in Taipei and Ho Chi Minh City stocks as the leaders of Taiwan and Vietnam said they would hold talks with Trump.","Dollar plunges to its lowest level against the euro in more than three years as investors flee what is typically considered a key haven currency.

Compared with a year earlier, producer prices rose 2.7%, down from a 3.2% year-over-year gain in February and much lower than the 3.3% economists had forecast. Gasoline prices fell 11.1% from February and egg prices, which had skyrocketed because of bird flu, plummeted 21.3%.Excluding volatile food and energy prices, so-called core wholesale inflation fell 0.1% from February, the first drop since July.

Its consumer price index rose just 2.4% last month from March 2024, the smallest year-over-year gain since September. Core consumer prices posted the smallest year-over-year increase in nearly four years.The inflation outlook is muddied by Trump's trade wars. He's imposing a 145% tax - a tariff - on Chinese imports and is hitting most of the rest of the world's imports with a 10% levy that might go up after 90 days.The trade barriers are widely expected to raise prices as importers attempt to pass along their higher costs.","The Labour Department said Friday that its producer price index - which tracks inflation before it hits consumers - fell 0.4% from February.

China-US trade war

Elon Musk-founded Tesla has discontinued accepting fresh orders for its Model S and Model X vehicles via its Chinese website, as reported by Reuters on Friday, amid escalating trade tensions between the world's leading economies.Customers can no longer place orders for these imported models through Tesla's WeChat mini programme account. Both vehicles are manufactured in the United States before being exported to China.The firm offered no explanation for this decision, which coincides with China's implementation of 84% tariffs on US products, following Trump's imposition of 145% duties on Chinese imports.The American automotive manufacturer produces Model 3 and Model Y vehicles at its Shanghai facility, serving both domestic Chinese market and European exports, which constitute the bulk of its sales.According to Li Yanwei, an analyst at the China Auto Dealers Association, China imported 1,553 Model X cars and 311 Model S cars in 2024.This comes amid an escalating trade war between the US and China, which began with President Trump hiking tariffs and China swiftly retaliating.The US, this week, dramatically raised tariffs on Chinese imports to 145% overall, citing unfair trade practices. China quickly retaliated with 84% tariffs on American goods.President Trump pulled back tariffs on other nations, offering a 90-day negotiation window, but held firm on China, declaring other countries are “lining up to negotiate.” In response, China accused the US of bullying and violating global trade norms, vowing to ""fight to the end.""China has stepped up its diplomatic efforts, especially in Europe and Southeast Asia, to build alliances.

EU pauses retaliation, but warns of ‘bazooka’



Trump says turmoil is ‘cost of transition’



NEW DELHI: Asian markets on Friday slumped with Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 nosediving over 5.6% in early trade, as investors reacted to mounting fears that the US-China trade war is spiralling out of control.The fresh jitters come a day after Wall Street erased much of its historic rally, triggered earlier in the week by President Donald Trump ’s temporary suspension of tariffs on several allies—excluding China.By late morning, Japan’s benchmark index was down 4.7% at 32,969.95. South Korea’s Kospi shed 1.6% while Australia’s ASX 200 lost 2.1%. The yen climbed sharply, with the dollar falling to 143.48 yen from about 146 yen on Thursday, a clear signal of investors rushing to safer assets. Gold also touched a new high as risk-off sentiment spread.The renewed sell-off was sparked after the White House clarified that Chinese imports will now face a 145% tariff rate, once earlier layers are included. Beijing swiftly responded with 84% tariffs on US goods and announced plans to reduce the number of Hollywood films imported—shaking stocks like Warner Bros. Discovery, which plunged 12.5%.US markets suffered their worst single-day drop in months on Thursday, effectively erasing the optimism sparked by earlier trade pauses.The S&P 500 slid 3.5%, closing at 5,268.05, while the Nasdaq suffered an even steeper fall of 4.3%. The Dow Jones tumbled 2.5%, shedding over 1,000 points to end at 39,593.66. The selloff was broad-based, with tech, financials, and consumer stocks all taking heavy hits. The plunge reflected deepening investor anxiety over rising tariffs, recession risks, and the possibility of a global slowdown.President Donald Trump confirmed on Thursday that his administration will move forward with a massive 145% tariff package on Chinese goods, significantly higher than the 125% figure floated earlier. While the White House recently paused tariffs on allies like the EU, Japan, and the UK, Trump framed the China move as a “necessary correction” to decades of unfair trade practices. “We’re bringing the jobs back. It’s tough love, but we’ll win,” he told reporters. Businesses and economists warned the steep duties could raise consumer prices and disrupt supply chains, particularly in electronics, automotive, and machinery sectors.Beijing responded swiftly to Trump’s tariff escalation, slapping 84% tariffs on key American exports including agricultural goods, electronics, and semiconductors. The Chinese government also announced a sharp reduction in the number of American films allowed to screen in China, a move that dealt a heavy blow to Hollywood. Shares of Warner Bros. Discovery plunged 12.5%, while Disney fell 6.8% amid fears of long-term market access losses. Analysts said the film industry, already grappling with streaming disruptions, could face major revenue hits if Chinese market access continues to narrow.Gold prices hit an all-time high as nervous investors piled into safe-haven assets amid deepening market turmoil. Uncertainty over global trade, equity volatility, and weakening currencies fuelled demand for the precious metal. Meanwhile, oil prices moved in the opposite direction. US crude fell 37 cents to $59.70 a barrel, while Brent crude dipped to $63.03. Traders pointed to concerns over potential demand destruction from slowing global growth and rising tariffs.The European Union said it would suspend its planned $22.4 billion in retaliatory tariffs against the United States for 90 days, offering a diplomatic window for negotiations. However, EU officials issued a stern warning, saying they are prepared to use their newly-adopted “anti-coercion instrument” — dubbed the ‘bazooka’ — if talks collapse. This tool gives the EU sweeping powers to impose countermeasures against economic bullying. While the pause was welcomed by business groups, Brussels made it clear that its patience has limits.Amid mounting market losses and global backlash, President Trump remained defiant, describing the economic upheaval as a “transition problem” necessary to achieve long-term prosperity. “We’ve been taken advantage of for decades. This is the correction — and when it’s over, it’ll be beautiful,” Trump said. He dismissed concerns about short-term pain, insisting that the tariff strategy would ultimately boost American manufacturing and reduce reliance on China. Critics, however, argue that Trump is underestimating the ripple effects on consumers, businesses, and global stability.(With inputs from agencies)","Nikkei 225 plunged 5.6% initially, later trading down 4.7% at 32,969.95 by mid- morning in Tokyo. yen surged against the US dollar, trading at ¥143.48, stronger than ¥146 the day before.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.","Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain.

That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas.

SAR imagery provides much higher resolution than other forms of remote sensing technology such as hyperspectral and multispectral. SAR is a critical technology for strategic reconnaissance and planning as well as for disaster management.According to Misra, winning the challenge in just over a year of floating the company is a major booster.He said L and P band SAR have an advantage over other frequencies (like X band) when it comes to penetration capabilities through rain, clouds, foliage and vegetation in a tropical country like India, and underground penetration capabilities in dry terrain.Continuing further, he said the L band SAR will provide 1 metre resolution, spotlight resolution in Stripmap mode. The current industry standard is 5-10 metre in L band. Misra said both the L and P band will operate simultaneously from a satellite borne SAR. Recently, Sisir Radar successfully developed and tested the world’s highest resolution L-Band SAR fitted on a drone. With 0.2 metre resolution, this is by far the highest L band SAR in the world, he said.","Space sector startup, Sisir Radar Private Ltd has hit success at the prestigious iDEX DefSpace Challenge.

India’s GDP growth outlook trimmed to 6.3% as private investment stalls and US tariffs loom: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/indias-gdp-growth-outlook-trimmed-to-6-3-as-private-investment-stalls-and-us-tariffs-loom-report/articleshow/120613489.cms,"AI-generated image

India’s economy is expected to grow at a slower pace in the current fiscal year, weighed down by subdued private sector investment and uncertainty surrounding American tariffs, according to a Reuters survey of economists.The fifth-largest economy in the world is projected to expand at an average rate of 6.3 per cent in FY2024 -25, based on a poll conducted from April 15-24 with participation from 54 economists. While this matches last year’s growth, it marks a slight downgrade from the 6.5 per cent forecast in a March survey. It still remains marginally above the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) recent projection of 6.2 per cent.However, this represents a significant drop from the 9.2 per cent GDP growth recorded in fiscal year 2023–24, highlighting a slowdown in momentum.Economists say the headline figures mask deeper structural issues, including the economy’s inability to generate enough high-paying jobs for its growing youth population. Despite government-led infrastructure investments, private sector capital expenditure has remained stagnant over the past decade, leaving India operating below its potential.The situation is further complicated by the proposed 26 per cent US tariff on Indian imports - currently suspended for a 90-day window starting April 10 — which has raised concerns despite India’s services-heavy exports to the US.“Middle-class Indians are struggling. Residential building sales, passenger vehicles, and two-wheeler sales have declined. It’s important that domestic policies address the root causes,” said Kunal Kundu, India economist at Société Générale.“India needs a 1991 moment,” he added, referencing the landmark liberalisation campaign led by then-finance minister Manmohan Singh. “The tariff war offers a perfect opportunity to push for structural reforms. Without them, even as the fastest-growing large economy in a low global growth environment, India may fall well short of its long-term ambition to become a developed nation.”In the survey, most economists said US tariffs have had a negative or severely negative impact on business sentiment. Some described the effect as neutral.“Business sentiment has certainly taken a hit — no business wants to make investment decisions in an uncertain and volatile environment. Investment is the most adversely affected component of the economy due to trade tariffs,” said Kanika Pasricha, chief economic advisor at Union Bank of India.She added that sectors previously poised for growth — including renewables, refineries, steel, and cement — may now scale back or delay capital expenditure plans.Meanwhile, with concerns of a potential US recession and India’s consumer inflation staying below the 4 per cent medium-term target for two straight months, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is expected to continue its moderate rate-cutting cycle. The central bank is likely to reduce rates by 25 basis points in June to 5.75 per cent, and possibly conclude the easing cycle in August at 5.50 per cent, according to the survey.“The unexpected drop in inflation... has created greater scope for monetary policy support to growth,” noted Dhiraj Nim, economist at ANZ.For FY2024–25, consumer inflation is projected to average 4.0 per cent, rising slightly to 4.3 per cent in the following fiscal year.This report based on Reuters survey comes days after the World Bank revised its prediction on India's growth to 6.3 per cent for FY 2025-26, cut from its previous estimate of 6.7 per cent.According to the report, as quoted by news agency PTI, ""In India, growth is expected to slow from 6.5 per cent in FY2024-25 to 6.3 per cent in FY 2025-26, as the benefits to private investment from monetary easing and regulatory streamlining are expected to be offset by global economic weakness and policy uncertainty.""The organisation's assessment indicates that India's current fiscal performance fell short of projections, primarily due to reduced private sector investments and unfulfilled public capital expenditure objectives.Read more: World Bank cuts India’s FY26 growth forecast to 6.3% citing global headwinds","The fifth-largest economy in the world is projected to expand at an average rate of 6.3 per cent in FY2024 -25, based on a poll conducted from April 15-24 with participation from 54 economists.

External probe: IndusInd's derivatives loss at Rs 2k crore,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/external-probe-indusinds-derivatives-loss-at-rs-2k-crore/articleshow/120678529.cms,"MUMBAI: IndusInd Bank will take a charge of Rs 1,956 crore in the fourth quarter of FY25 to correct longstanding discrepancies in its derivatives valuation. The private lender also plans to hold employees accountable for the lapses that inflated its reported profits over several years.In a disclosure to stock exchanges, the bank said that an independent investigation, commissioned in March 2025, had confirmed an adverse accounting impact of Rs 1,960 crore as of March 31st. The investigation report was submitted on Saturday and taken up by the board which met for the purpose on Saturday and Sunday. The bank has not revealed the name of the external agency which was appointed by the bank, but sources said that it was Grant Thornton.The discrepancies stemmed from internal derivative trades between the asset-liability management desk and the treasury, which used accrual accounting, while external counterparties' trades were marked to market. This mismatch allowed IndusInd to defer losses internally while prematurely booking gains externally, overstating earnings. The bank began internal derivatives trade between its asset-liability management desk and treasury in 2017-18, mostly hedging foreign currency borrowings in yen and dollars.A regulatory intervention in Sept 2023, when the RBI tightened derivatives accounting rules, prompted an internal review.The central bank subsequently banned internal derivatives trades from April 2024, forcing IndusInd to unwind its positions. In March 2025, the bank warned of a Rs 1,600 crore pre-tax hit.","IndusInd Bank will take a charge of Rs 1,956 crore in the fourth quarter of FY25 to correct longstanding discrepancies in its derivatives valuation.

MUMBAI: Geopolitical tensions between India and Pakistan, in the backdrop of the Pahalgam terror attack , trading trends by foreign funds, quarterly results by companies in India and the US, and trading trends in the US markets will decide how investors on Dalal Street behave in the truncated trading week.The volatile nature of Indo-Pak relations, especially after the suspected backing of the terrorists by Pakistani actors, took its toll on the market on Friday, pulling the sensex and Nifty down by about 0.8% each, while mid and smallcap stocks were hit even worse. The day's selling also wiped out over Rs 8 lakh crore worth of investors' wealth. If Indo-Pak tensions continue and skirmishes at the border escalate, there could be more downside to the market, brokers and traders said on Sunday.Surprisingly, foreign funds are betting big on India despite the tensions at the border.

From P&G to Reckitt and PepsiCo, companies in their recent earnings calls said that consumption in India remains steady, even as some firms have lowered their full-year forecasts due to the global backdrop.""If you look at markets like India, we are profitable, and India is driving mid-single-digit growth very nicely. We have local production on the ground, and we have R&D capability on the ground. The market gets better every time we look at it,"" said Andre Schulten, chief financial officer at P&G. The firm, however, did not rule out the possibility of volatility in emerging markets going ahead in line with the macro developments unfolding globally. The maker of Pampers and Tide detergent, which expects current tariffs to have an impact of $1-$1.5 billion, said that currently the largest US tariff impacts are coming from raw and packaging materials and some finished products sourced from China.Unilever's acting CFO, Srinivas Phatak, said that in India, there are no new macroeconomic headwinds and that is an ""important element to call out"".Govt incentives, tax relief, and lower food and oil inflation are potential consumption tailwinds that set up the market for good growth, the firm said.""I think this is a market where we'll be unblinking in our defense. And when we get our growth engine moving up, we know how to really make money here and how really to drive earnings ahead of growth,"" said Phatak. A huge population and an increasing shift from unbranded to branded consumption help companies tap into new growth spaces in India, even though broader local consumption has been subdued over the past few quarters due to tepid urban demand.Reckitt said that the company has seen strong volume growth in emerging markets led by China and India, particularly in the germ protection and intimate wellness spaces. ""We fully expect sustained strong volume growth in China and India and in other emerging markets as we go through this year,"" said CEO Kris Licht.The company expects Europe to deliver low single-digit growth and North America to show a low single-digit decline in Q2, given the weaker consumer backdrop.

Morgan Stanley has an ‘overweight’ rating on Axis Bank with a target price of Rs 1,300. Analysts said the bank’s earnings remained subdued with loan and deposit growth muted, and gross credit costs (ex-agriculture) stayed elevated. They said both were largely expected.

Analysts said during the Jan-march quarter, SBI Life's value of new business growth of 10% on an annualised basis to Rs 1,700 surprised positively aided by better product mix and term insurance attachment. The life insurer’s premium (APE) growth was softer at 2% partly due to slower ULIPs and efforts to improve mix.Goldman Sachs has a ‘buy’ rating on SBI Cards with the target price at Rs 1,006.

They also said that the company’s credit costs have finally shown an improvement after seeing an increase consecutively for the last five quarters.They also expect further improvement from FY25 to FY26.Citigroup has a ‘sell’ call on Tech Mahindra with the target price at Rs 1,265.

Happy developers: iOS stores facilitate Rs 45k crore sales in 2024

NEW DELHI: It's not just the multi-billion-dollar sale of iPhones and lucrative exports, the world's biggest electronics company Apple has also hit a jackpot in developer billings and sales on the iOS app ecosystem in India.The Cupertino-headquartered company has reaped in a rich engagement through its app ecosystem in India, raking in $5.3 billion (around Rs 44,447 crore) last year.This has opened a whole new frontier for the company in India, and has seen Apple's business engagement cross nearly $27 billion (Rs 2.3 lakh crore) in 2024, sources told TOI. This includes around $8 billion of sales of iPhones and other products such as Air Pods, MacBooks and iPads in the local market, $14 billion of exports (a large part to the US), and $5-billion-plus of app store transactions.Such has been the intensity through the India app Store that Apple's global CEO Tim Cook has termed it a ""miracle for developers in India"" due to the rush in transactions. ""The app store has been an economic miracle for developers in India and all around the world, and we're thrilled to support their work,"" Cook said as he commented on the billings and sales estimates for 2024, arrived at in a study conducted by IIM, Ahmedabad, professor Viswanath Pingali.Cook further said, ""This study underlines the power of India's incredibly vibrant app economy. And we're committed to keep investing in the success of developers of all sizes as they build apps that make an important impact and enrich people's lives.""Interestingly, more than 94% of billings and sales facilitated by the app store in India accrued solely to the developers, without any commission paid to Apple. Also, the global earnings of India-based developers tripled over the past five years through the engagement on the apps which are available across Apple's markets.On an average, more than 22 million users visited the India app store each week - double to what it was three years ago. Throughout the year, iOS users in India downloaded apps nearly 1.1 billion times, which is also almost double to what it was three years ago. A significant share of the app store ecosystem in India is driven by the local developer community: 38% of the downloads by users in India in 2024 were for apps developed by India-based developers. This represents a 27% increase in the share of local downloads compared to five years ago.Talking about the global reach, the study shows that close to 80% of India-based developers' app store earnings came from users outside of the country, and 87% of developers were active on multiple storefronts (countries).""Throughout the same year, users from all over the world downloaded apps from developers in India more than 755 million times through the app store - twice as many as five years ago. Many apps from India-based developers have also appeared on the most-downloaded app charts in storefronts outside of India, and apps from India-based developers were in the top 100 most-downloaded apps in 70 storefronts outside of India. ""In the last five years, downloads by Indian users have more than tripled, and earnings from these users have increased more than five-fold, the study said.","Apple has reaped in a rich engagement through its app ecosystem in India. The Cupertino-headquartered company raked in $5.3 billion (around Rs 44,447 crore) last year. This includes $8 billion of sales of iPhones and other products such as Air Pods, MacBooks and iPads.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120678127,imgsize-619844,width-400,resizemode-4/120678127.jpg"

The revised document, seen by The Associated Press, now emphasises reducing ideological bias to enhance economic competitiveness.Technology professionals are accustomed to adapting their work to changing Washington priorities.According to the Associated Press, this transition concerns field experts, including Harvard University sociologist Ellis Monk, who previously assisted Google in developing more inclusive AI products.The technology sector had recognised issues with computer vision AI, particularly regarding image recognition.These systems showed promise commercially but reflected historical prejudices similar to earlier photographic technologies that poorly represented Black and brown individuals.Google implemented Monk's colour scale, improving AI image tools' representation of diverse skin tones, replacing an older standard designed for white dermatology patients.""Consumers definitely had a huge positive response to the changes,"" he said. Monk considers the future of such initiatives uncertain.While his Monk Skin Tone Scale remains secure within numerous products at Google and elsewhere - including camera phones, video games, AI image generators - he and colleagues worry about reduced support for future inclusive technology development.""Google wants their products to work for everybody, in India, China, Africa, et cetera. That part is kind of DEI-immune,"" Monk told the Associated Press.""But could future funding for those kinds of projects be lowered? Absolutely, when the political mood shifts and when there's a lot of pressure to get to market very quickly,"" Monk added.The Trump administration has cut hundreds of science, technology, and health funding grants related to DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) themes, though his impact on the commercial development of chatbots and other AI products has been more indirect.Meanwhile, Republican Rep.

China lowers tax refund threshold for tourists in bid to boost consumer spending,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/china-lowers-tax-refund-threshold-for-tourists-in-bid-to-boost-consumer-spending/articleshow/120667473.cms,"In an effort to stimulate domestic consumption amid ongoing trade tensions with the United States, China has lowered the minimum purchase amount required for foreign tourists to qualify for tax refunds.Starting Sunday, international travellers can apply for tax rebates on purchases of just 200 yuan (about $27) made at the same store on the same day, down from the previous threshold of 500 yuan (about $69), according to a joint statement released by the Ministry of Commerce and other authorities.The upper cash rebate limit has also been doubled to 20,000 yuan ($2,745), while the government plans to increase the number of designated tax refund shops and simplify the refund process. In areas heavily frequented by tourists, local governments are being encouraged to establish immediate refund points for faster service.Speaking at a news conference, Vice Minister of Commerce Sheng Qiuping said inbound tourism spending made up only about 0.5% of China’s GDP in 2024, far below the 1%–3% range seen in other major economies—signalling room for growth. He noted that foreign tourist spending in China surged to $94.2 billion last year, marking a 77.8% increase.China’s economy grew by 5.4% year-on-year in the first quarter, buoyed by strong export activity ahead of fresh US tariffs. However, analysts expect a slowdown as tariffs of up to 145% on Chinese goods take hold.

"Roche could have earned over 100 times what it cost for rare disease drug, estimate activists",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/roche-could-have-earned-over-100-times-what-it-cost-for-rare-disease-drug-estimate-activists/articleshow/120624790.cms,"File photo: AP

Pharma major Roche may have earned over a hundred times what risdiplam , a drug used to treat spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), should cost to bring to market, according to calculations by public health activists.After Roche declined to share information on the cost of clinical trials, Knowledge Ecology International (KEI), a US-based non-profit working on access to affordable medicines, calculated the costs and pegged them at about $50 million. Roche earned $5.8 billion from the sale of risdiplam in the 2021-2024 period, about 115 times the calculated cost.In response to the calculations sent to it by KEI, Roche stated: “Only a small fraction of projects make it ‘from bench to bedside’ and we have to absorb the cost of failing projects as well, while your calculation only addresses successful development. Similarly, our dedication to innovation extends to the continuous development of next-generation therapies—a commitment clearly reflected in our ongoing development work of new treatments in SMA. ”The three trials of risdiplam cited in the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) involved 467 participants. The four trials with a start date before FDA approval involved 120 participants. KEI estimated per patient cost of conducting the trial by combining several data sources on the cost of conducting clinical trials.The United States provides a tax credit for qualifying clinical trials for rare diseases. After calculating the cost of the clinical trials, when KEI applied the orphan drug tax credit to the trial cost, the net cost ranged from $11 million to $25 million.Clinical trials typically constitute 60-70% of drug development costs.Roche was also awarded a Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher (PRV) in August 2020. The PRV is an incentive designed to encourage development of drugs and biologics for serious or life-threatening rare diseases. The PRV allows earlier market entry and extends the effective period of the monopoly by several months. The PRV can be sold to third parties. In 2020, the market value of a PRV was roughly $100 million, more than the Roche outlays on trials, pointed out KEI.Since 2003, when it was established, the Spinal Muscular Atrophy Foundation (SMAF) has invested $100 million to develop drugs for this condition. Roche paid $30 million dollars to get an exclusive worldwide license to PTC Therapeutics' SMA programme, which it had developed in collaboration with SMAF.Roche’s costs of manufacturing the drug are not significant, with a year of treatment requiring less than 2 grams of risdiplam, which can probably be manufactured by Roche at less than $50,000 per kilo, or $50 per gram, estimated KEI. In India, the treatment with risdiplam typically costs Rs 72 lakh per adult patient per year, which is unaffordable for most.According to Roche’s response to TOI, as of October 2024, of the 168 patients receiving Roche’s treatment for SMA, 56 continued to be treated for free under the company’s Compassionate User Program (CUP), 53 were covered under various government policies -- Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS), Defence, Employee State Insurance (ESI) and Railways -- and the remaining 59 purchased the drug under Roche’s Patient Access Program, launched in 2021, “under which Roche provides free bottles of the treatment for every bottle that is purchased”.Cure SMA, a trust formed by parents of children with SMA, has 1,800 patients registered and the government portal for rare disease has 700 SMA patients registered.Lack of affordability has made patients approach courts to help bring down costs through local manufacture or through price negotiation by the government. Roche has opposed generic manufacture of the drug by an Indian company. A bottle of risdiplam costs Rs 2 lakh in India while it costs just Rs 44,700 in China and Rs 41,000 in Pakistan, according to an affidavit filed by an SMA patient in court. The Indian generic manufacturer, NATCO, has pegged the cost at Rs 15,900 per bottle with scope for further reduction if the government purchased it in bulk.“On average, it takes ten years to develop a new drug and only one out of ten drugs in early development will eventually make it to patients. And it is very complex to estimate the total cost of developing a new medicine, especially for extremely rare neurological diseases such as SMA. The cost of development goes well beyond preclinical research, clinical trials, and post-marketing studies, requiring many years of investment. There are also costs associated with ensuring safe and quality manufacturing setup and operations, and building a global and local infrastructure to ensure access around the world.,” stated Roche in its response to TOI.","Roche earned $5.8 billion from the sale of risdiplam in the 2021-2024 period, about 115 times the calculated cost.

California has overtaken Japan in terms of its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) — a milestone highlighted by Governor Gavin Newsom , who warned that President Donald Trump's tariff policies could endanger the state’s growing prosperity.According to preliminary figures from the US Bureau of Economic Analysis, California posted a nominal gross domestic product (GDP) of $4.1 trillion in 2024. This is higher than Japan’s $4.02 trillion GDP for the same period, as reported by the International Monetary Fund.This places California just behind the United States, China and Germany in total economic output, with the state’s economy growing by 6 per cent in 2024 — outpacing all three of those nations.“California isn’t just keeping pace with the world — we’re setting the pace,” Newsom said in a statement Wednesday according to CNN. “Our economy is thriving because we invest in people, prioritise sustainability, and believe in the power of innovation.”However, Newsom cautioned that the state’s economic progress is under threat from what he called “the reckless tariff policies of the current federal administration.”“California’s economy powers the nation, and it must be protected,” he added.Also read: Donald Trump tariffs to hit global economy hard!

The suit argues that these measures are inflicting economic harm on California’s businesses and residents.The legal filing contests Trump’s authority to enact tariffs on key trading partners — Mexico, China and Canada — under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), citing a 10 per cent blanket tariff on all imports. Newsom's team argues the move is “unlawful and unprecedented” without congressional approval.Enacted in 1977, the IEEPA grants presidents broad powers to implement economic sanctions during national emergencies, but requires consultation with Congress.California recorded $675 billion in two-way trade in 2024, with Mexico, Canada and China serving as its primary trading partners. These three countries alone accounted for over 40 per cent of the state’s imports — $203 billion of the $491 billion total.Twelve other states joined California in filing lawsuits on Wednesday, accusing the Trump administration of implementing tariffs that amount to illegal tax hikes. The White House dismissed the coordinated legal challenge as a “witch hunt.”","California has overtaken Japan in terms of its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) Governor Gavin Newsom warned that President Donald Trump's tariff policies could endanger the state’s growing prosperity.

Donald Trump’s tariffs hit hard: Corporations across various sectors worldwide are grappling with rising prices, revised financial projections , and heightened concerns as trade policies under US President Donald Trump escalate operational costs, disrupt supply chains, and create economic uncertainty First-quarter earnings reports revealed that companies globally faced substantial challenges, as leadership teams sought to adapt to the administration's fluctuating trade policies.

'Race with China to out-innovate': Trump administration eases safety rules for Tesla and other automakers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/race-with-china-to-out-innovate-trump-administration-eases-safety-rules-for-tesla-and-other-automakers/articleshow/120608194.cms,"Representative image

In a policy shift aimed at accelerating US leadership in autonomous vehicle technology , the Trump administration is easing federal safety regulations to help domestic automakers like Elon Musk ’s Tesla stay ahead of Chinese rivals.The US department of transportation on Thursday unveiled a new framework that allows American companies to seek exemptions from certain safety rules when testing self-driving cars for non-commercial purposes—such as research and public demonstrations.""We’re in a race with China to out-innovate, and the stakes couldn’t be higher,” said Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy in a statement, justifying the move. “Our new framework will slash red tape and move us closer to a single national standard ,"" he added.The move is intended to give US automakers greater flexibility as they push to develop fully autonomous vehicles.The administration is also revising crash reporting requirements for self-driving systems, a move directly addressing longstanding complaints from Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who has argued the rules are overly burdensome. Tesla, as the leading seller of partially automated vehicles in the US, has been disproportionately impacted by current reporting demands.While the obligation to report crashes will remain, the Transportation Department says it will be “loosened” to remove “unnecessary and duplicative” requirements—striking a balance between regulatory oversight and technological progress.The announcement comes just a day after Musk told investors that Tesla will begin rolling out self-driving taxis in Austin, Texas, this June. As China’s BYD and other rivals rapidly scale up their autonomous vehicle programs, the pressure is mounting on the US to respond.Previously, such exemptions were granted primarily to foreign vehicles entering the US market whose home-country regulations differed from those in the US.Also read: ‘India a very hot market but...’: Elon Musk-led Tesla says 100% car tariffs make customers anxious The incentive for Tesla comes just days after the automaker reported a stark drop of 71 per cent in profits in its Q1 earnings report. European sales of Tesla vehicles experienced a significant downturn, showing a 45 per cent reduction in the EU market and an even more severe 62 percent decrease in Germany, as reported by the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (ACEA). Tesla showrooms throughout Europe and the United States have faced vandalism and boycott actions, triggered by Musk's endorsement of public sector reductions and his alignment with far-right personalities abroad.

Most Asian stocks climbed on Friday, driven by a strong rally on Wall Street, robust quarterly earnings from Alphabet, and renewed optimism around trade relations under US President Donald Trump.While most stocks showed positive trend, Indian stock indices, BSE Sensex and Nifty50 , opened higher, but later plunged 700 points with the Sensex at 78,962.42 and Nifty50 also down at 23,926.95 during early trade. This came after seven days of gains, with the market pausing on Thursday, ending in the red due to cautious investor sentiment. Foreign portfolio investors made net purchases of Rs 8,250 crore, while domestic investors sold Rs 534 crore. Market direction will likely depend on global trends and upcoming Q4 earnings.Meanwhile, Tokyo’s Nikkei rose 1 per cent, with gains also seen in Hong Kong and Shanghai. The Nikkei’s rise came despite a major profit warning from Nissan, which projected losses of up to $5.3 billion for fiscal 2024–25. Still, shares of the automaker jumped more than 3 per cent on Friday. Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Tatsuo Yoshida said markets recognize Nissan is “moving ahead toward turnaround,” noting that booking impairment losses and restructuring charges is a necessary step forward.Seoul’s benchmark index gained 0.5 per cent after US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent suggested a potential trade ""understanding"" with South Korea could be reached by next week.Positive momentum extended across other Asia-Pacific markets, including Taipei, Sydney, Singapore, Manila, and Wellington.Investor sentiment was further lifted by Alphabet’s impressive quarterly results. The Google parent reported a $34.5 billion profit for the quarter, with revenue up 12 per cent year-over-year to $90.2 billion. Its cloud division saw especially strong growth, rising 28 per cent to $12.3 billion.Read more: Google parent Alphabet reports 12% revenue surge in Q1, $34.5 billion profit driven by Cloud and AI growth This comes after US equities extended gains for a third consecutive session on Thursday, even as prospects for trade agreements with China and the European Union remained uncertain.Also read: Wall Street rallies on strong corporate earnings despite lingering trade war jitters Meanwhile, Beijing dismissed recent reports of ongoing trade talks with Washington as “groundless,” countering Trump’s optimistic remarks about potentially reducing steep tariffs on Chinese imports. Meanwhile, France’s economy minister Eric Lombard noted that a US-EU trade agreement remains a distant prospect.Despite these mixed signals, international markets remained resilient. “There are mixed signals about whether there have been some talks about trade between the US and China,” said Lloyd Chan, senior currency analyst at MUFG, in comments to AFP. “Nonetheless, the trade war and US policy-related uncertainty have persisted. Asian economies still face the risk of higher reciprocal tariffs,” he added.Adding to the optimism, Chan pointed to a growing possibility of earlier-than-expected interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve. Fed Governor Christopher Waller indicated support for easing policy should steep tariffs begin to weigh on employment.","Indian stock indices, BSE Sensex and Nifty50, opened higher, but later plunged 700 points.

Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway has amassed $300.87 billion in US Treasury bills, accounting for nearly 5% of the entire short-term government debt market.As of March 2025, the total US Treasury bill market stood at $6.15 trillion, which means Berkshire controls approximately 4.89% of it—equivalent to nearly one in every twenty dollars in circulation, according to an ET report.The move highlights Buffett's focus on safety and liquidity amid high stock valuations and ongoing global economic uncertainty. The report also noted that Berkshire’s T-bill holdings now exceed those of the US Federal Reserve, which owns just over $195 billion in similar securities.More than 90% of Berkshire’s $334 billion cash reserves are invested in short-term government debt. This includes $14.4 billion classified as cash equivalents with maturities under three months, and $286.47 billion listed as short-term Treasury investments.With average T-bill yields at 4.359% in April 2025, Buffett appears to be prioritizing stable returns over riskier investments. The billionaire investor has not made a major acquisition in over two years, often citing high valuations as the reason. “Everything’s too expensive,” he has said in past interviews.Other major companies like Apple have also increased their exposure to Treasuries. Apple currently holds $15.5 billion in Treasury securities as part of its $30 billion in total cash and equivalents.However, its position is much smaller than Berkshire’s.Buffett continues to wait for what he calls the “fat pitch”—a compelling value investment opportunity—before redeploying large amounts of capital into risk assets.",Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway has amassed $300.87 billion in US Treasury bills.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

That kind of digital-led wholesale business still accounts for a very small part of India’s overall retail market but can balloon to $150 billion in sales and yield a 100% return on capital invested in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co. estimates published in the Mint newspaper.Bengaluru-based Udaan has also ventured into financing through its fintech unit which helps shopkeepers get working capital loans to buy inventory. That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says. Udaan competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods. The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-105001128,imgsize-151312,width-400,resizemode-4/105001128.jpg"

Space sector start-up Sisir Radar to develop SAR on L/P band SAR,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/space-sector-start-up-sisir-radar-to-develop-sar-on-l/p-band-sar/articleshow/104558111.cms,"CHENNAI: Space sector startup, Sisir Radar Private Ltd has hit success at the prestigious iDEX DefSpace Challenge with its projects for development of “L/P band Continuous Wave SAR (synthetic aperture radar) payload for LEO Small Satellites” and “Unfurlable, Electronically Steering Antenna for L/P band SAR payload” for Indian Air Force (IAF), said a top company official.The company is promoted by former Director at the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) Tapan Misra and the brains behind the Indian space agency’s RISAT series of SAR satellites as well as the Dual Frequency SAR on the Chandrayaan 2 orbiter that is currently circling the moon.""A grant of Rs 3 crore is also there for development of the products,"" Misra told IANS.Synthetic Aperture Radar or SAR is a special kind of imaging radar technology that can provide extremely accurate high resolution imagery of the terrain through clouds, smoke and dust even in pitch dark conditions. SAR imagery provides much higher resolution than other forms of remote sensing technology such as hyperspectral and multispectral. SAR is a critical technology for strategic reconnaissance and planning as well as for disaster management.According to Misra, winning the challenge in just over a year of floating the company is a major booster.He said L and P band SAR have an advantage over other frequencies (like X band) when it comes to penetration capabilities through rain, clouds, foliage and vegetation in a tropical country like India, and underground penetration capabilities in dry terrain.Continuing further, he said the L band SAR will provide 1 metre resolution, spotlight resolution in Stripmap mode. The current industry standard is 5-10 metre in L band. Misra said both the L and P band will operate simultaneously from a satellite borne SAR. Recently, Sisir Radar successfully developed and tested the world’s highest resolution L-Band SAR fitted on a drone. With 0.2 metre resolution, this is by far the highest L band SAR in the world, he said.","Space sector startup, Sisir Radar Private Ltd has hit success at the prestigious iDEX DefSpace Challenge.

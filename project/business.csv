Despite these challenges, India's quick commerce potential makes this IPO attractive for long-term investors, though business execution risks persist, the analysis says.Market analysts have diverse opinions regarding the Swiggy IPO, considering the company's present financial condition, market competition, and valuation metrics. However, the food delivery sector's growth potential makes it a considerable option for long-term investors.""As of the fiscal year 2024, Swiggy continues to operate at a loss, in contrast to its competitor, Zomato, which has recently achieved profitability. We advise investors to Avoid this IPO until the company's financial performance and growth outlook improve. Waiting until Swiggy demonstrates improved financial results and a clearer path to sustainable growth would be a more prudent investment approach,"" said Samco Securities.""Swiggy, at an upper price band of Rs 390.0, is valued at Price/Sales, EV/Sales and P/BV multiple of 7.8x/7.3x/7.1x respectively of its FY24 financials on post issue capital.

What will Donald Trump as US President mean for Indian stock markets? Top advantages & disadvantages,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/what-will-donald-trump-as-us-president-mean-for-indian-stock-markets-top-advantages-disadvantages/articleshow/115005808.cms,"India stands to potentially benefit from this situation, with improved prospects for Foreign Portfolio Investment.

Benefits of Trump's Potential Victory for India

Indian export sectors could gain significant advantages if Trump wins, as higher tariffs on Chinese products may enhance competitiveness of Indian manufacturers in areas like auto parts, solar equipment, and chemical production in US markets.

Energy costs might decrease due to Trump's fossil fuel policies and expected slower Chinese economic growth. This could positively impact Indian oil companies like HPCL, BPCL, IOC, and gas distribution firms such as IGL and MGL.

Manufacturing and defense sectors could experience growth as Trump's emphasis on US industrial development may benefit companies operating in both countries, including ABB, Siemens, Cummins, Honeywell, GE T&D, and Hitachi Energy.

Resolution of international tensions under Trump could improve supply chain efficiency, aiding Indian businesses. His focus on strengthening US manufacturing and military capabilities could provide opportunities for Indian defense companies like Bharat Dynamics and HAL.

The business climate could improve with Trump's leadership, potentially benefiting Indian equity markets through reduced corporate taxation, fewer regulatory requirements, and business-friendly policies.

Disadvantages for India due to Trump's Return:

A Trump presidency could trigger inflation, affecting Indian businesses through higher interest rates and increased costs for US-sourced materials and equipment. Economic experts anticipate that his proposed policies on tariffs, deportation, and deficit spending could cause inflationary pressures, resulting in immediate price increases and wage adjustments.

Trump's economic policies could strengthen the US dollar and increase bond yields through tax reductions and fiscal measures. This would attract global capital to the US, potentially weakening emerging market currencies including the Indian rupee. A stronger dollar would increase India's import expenses, particularly for oil, leading to higher domestic inflation.

Despite possible initial market gains, Trump's policy uncertainties could create extended market instability. Previous data shows US markets outperformed Indian markets during his first term, with Nasdaq gaining 77% compared to Nifty's 38%.

Previous restrictions on H-1B visas under Trump affected Indian IT companies through increased rejection rates and costs. However, these companies have adapted by increasing local US hiring and green card holders, reducing their vulnerability to future immigration restrictions.

Trump has criticized India's trade policies and suggested reciprocal tariffs. His administration could pressure India to reduce trade barriers, affecting sectors like IT, pharmaceuticals, and textiles. However, his efforts to reduce Chinese manufacturing dependence could benefit India.

The anticipated increase in the US fiscal deficit under Trump could lead to global inflation and higher interest rates, creating challenges for emerging markets' monetary policies. While India's domestic-focused economy provides some buffer, a Harris victory would likely maintain current economic frameworks with minimal disruption.

US election results : Republican candidate Donald Trump is projected to defeat Democrat candidate Kamala Harris in the US presidential elections, as per the latest counting trends. Indian equity markets have responded positively to Trump’s potential win. But what will the long-term impact of Trump at the White House be for Indian stock markets?A Republican sweep might trigger a short-term upswing in stock markets, primarily due to gains in US equity markets, as per Emkay Global's analysis.The Chinese markets, however, are expected to face heightened volatility and uncertainty during this period.India appears to be among the primary beneficiaries of Trump's presidency, particularly concerning economic and foreign policy matters. As Nomura's Sonal Verma states, ""We see India as a relative beneficiary, due to its domestic demand-driven growth model and benefits from lower commodity prices, supply chain shifts and on foreign policy.""The advantages India stands to gain from the current supply chain reorganisation, as companies reduce their dependence on China during Trump's administration, are likely to outweigh any potential challenges related to trade and immigration policies, according to Verma.According to an ET analysis, India stands to potentially benefit from this situation, with improved prospects for Foreign Portfolio Investment positioning and increased capital flows, according to the brokerage firm's assessment.

DA Hike Calculator: How much will the take home salary increase?

To understand the impact of this 3% DA hike, let's consider an example:

Assuming a central government employee has a basic pay of Rs 46,200, their previous dearness allowance at 50% was Rs 23,100. With the DA now at 53%, their dearness allowance will increase to Rs 24,486.

This means they will receive an additional Rs 1,386 (Rs 24,486 - Rs 23,100) in DA from October. As the DA hike is effective from July 1, 2024, they will also receive arrears for the last three months.

DR Hike Calculator: How much will the pension increase?

If a central government pensioner receives a basic pension of Rs 50,400 per month, at the previous 50% DR, they were getting Rs 25,200.

With the DR now at 53%, they will receive Rs 26,712 monthly as dearness relief. This means their pension will increase by Rs 1,512 per month.

Additionally, the dearness relief (DR) for central government pensioners has also been raised by 3%.

This decision is set to benefit over 1 crore individuals.The dearness allowance, a component of the salary for government employees and pensioners, has been increased to 53%. This rise in DA will lead to an increase in the take-home salary of central government employees starting from October 2024.The effective date for the increased DA and DR is July 1, 2024. The central government typically revises these allowances twice a year, in January and July, with official announcements being made at a later date.

The CAPE (cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings) metric, which calculates earnings over a 10-year period, smooths out cyclical fluctuations but may not fully capture structural changes in market dynamics.The report stated that the US S&P 500's CAPE ratio, at the dawn of the millennium, reached unprecedented levels before falling in the early 2000s, yet it has since soared to levels not seen before and was only briefly exceeded in the previous century.The report also explained that the US's tech dominance, advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), and structural shifts in earnings expectations help justify these elevated valuations.It said, ""The bulls would argue that tech dominance and AI hopes offer the US that structural shift, and perhaps India's outlook is so positive that investors are prepared to pay up for the potential growth.""It suggested that India's favorable growth outlook and its potential as a key player in global markets help explain why investors are willing to pay a premium.Furthermore, the report stated that the two countries are set to start the next quarter of the century (2025-2049) on a strong note, but they remain expensive compared to markets with more moderate valuations. These speculations make them key markets to watch, as their growth trajectories depend on investor confidence in their structural strengths and future potential.","Deutsche Bank report: Indian equity markets have outperformed China's equity markets since 2000.

Railway Budget 2024 : The government has wavered little in its efforts to spur a modernisation of railways in the country, pivoting on technology, to support the country’s economic ambitions. In line with expectations, Union Budget 2024-25 set the capex for railways at a record Rs 2.65 lakh crore, marking yet another year of successive increase in outlay. That takes forward the past policies and the government’s vision, which have paved the way for modernisation of the transport behemoth.In earlier decades, the government had focused on laying tracks on new routes, electrification and incremental rolling stock capacity addition. That was the need of the hour back then and has helped set up the base for a larger transformation.For instance, the massive Dedicated Freight Corridor ( DFC ) as well as locomotive factories at Marhaura and Madhepura in Bihar were conceptualised over a decade ago and we are seeing their completion now.More recently, the focus has shifted to modernisation—of rolling stock and safety systems, among other aspects.This year, emphasis has also been laid on the railways’ crucial role in industrial development. Commodity-specific corridors have been planned in eastern India and impetus given to port connectivity. Vande Bharat and technology-led upgrades in rolling stock remain in focus. Safety has been prioritised through budgetary allocations for the anti-collision systemKavach . That said, there are other cogs in the wheel that demand attention from a long-term perspective.First, the target for the Operating Ratio, the crucial efficiency gauge, has been set at 98.22% for 2024-25, compared with 98.65% in 2023-24. This reflects an imminent need for operational transformation. An effective overhaul of the world’s fourth-largest rail network will take many years and thus we need to start focusing on improving efficiency and reducing costs now.DFC is almost entirely operational and will be complete over the next few months. To ensure the project achieves its twin goals of reducing logistics costs and enhancing freight efficiency, railways need to attract more cargo on the corridor. This will help increase the rail coefficient and make the railways’ approach more market-oriented, which will in turn aid future corridors.A revamp of railway stations is on track, with sufficient funds dedicated to this end. But even though new coaches and wagons are increasingly being added to meet footfalls, the stations and passenger trains themselves remain synonymous with chaos.Just as safety, comfort and convenience have been prioritised, there is a need for solutions to address the capacity and demand challenges. As a first step, the government could target development of new stations and setting up of new coach production units.As a leading freight mover, Indian Railways carried a record 1,588 MT cargo in fiscal 2024, up from 1,095 MT in fiscal 2015. It accounts for 26% of the cargo moved in the country—by no means an easy feat. The railways aims to take this volume to 3,000 MT by 2030, which would require a 11% CAGR against the around 4.2% witnessed over the last 10 years. As per a report by TERI and Shakti Foundation, from carrying about 62% of freight traffic in 1990-91, Indian Railways’ share has declined to ~27% in 2014-15. This has been due to the expanding road network, cost competitiveness over railways, and door-to-door service. Thus, commencing the cycle of increasing the rail share again is commendable.DFCs, a high-capacity track network, high-power locomotives and improvement in wagon designs have set the ball rolling for larger capacity, faster freight trains that deliver better efficiency.Yet, achieving exponential growth is a tall ask given the current dynamics. Possibly, similar challenges might apply to other goals the railways might have for 2047.To be fair, despite its scale and complexity, Indian Railways has been able to achieve diverse developments at commendable speed.But the track ahead is long and it is time to start discussing the reinvention of the institutional set-up.Indian Railways sees substantial private sector involvement in the form of vendors and contractors. Policymakers could start mulling extreme options such as parallel privately-owned and operated railway infrastructure, coupled with centralised planning and an evolved role for the railways. This will need a robust policy framework from the Government of India.The time is perhaps also ripe to bring user charge and asset monetisation-driven segments for passengers as well as cargo to the discussion table. Globally, the separation of infrastructure and operations in railways has delivered mixed results, for example in the United Kingdom. The model should be analysed and revisited to understand its potential relevance in the Indian context.The key would be to retrace our steps and align our long-term goals to identify not just incremental changes but also ways to explore bold and path-breaking alternatives that put Indian Railways on a smooth track and bring it up to speed.","Union Budget 2024-25 set the capex for railways at a record Rs 2.65 lakh crore.

Budget 2024 capital gains tax changes: The Narendra Modi government is considering suggestions for tweaks in the new long term capital gains tax regime that was announced by FM Nirmala Sitharaman in Union Budget 2024.The July 23 budget reduced the LTCG tax on property from 20% to 12.5%. The indexation benefit, which allowed taxpayers to adjust the acquisition cost for inflation before calculating capital gains and thus reduce their tax liability, is proposed to be eliminated for properties purchased on or after April 1, 2001. The government publishes the Cost Inflation Index (CII) annually for this calculation.India Inc is appealing to the government for a gradual shift to the long-term capital gains tax regime proposed in the FY25 budget, which aims to eliminate indexation benefits for property, gold, and other unlisted assets.According to an ET report by Deepshikha Sikarwar, the industry is suggesting alternatives such as a higher tax rate with indexation or a lower rate of 12.5% without indexation, as well as some form of grandfathering for ancestral properties.The finance ministry is currently reviewing these proposals and will discuss them with the Prime Minister's Office.

Budget 2024 for manufacturing sector : The recent Union Budget has struck a balance between fiscal consolidation and stimulating economic growth. While the middle class has been offered tax relief, the government's primary focus remains on judicious spending to maximize economic impact. The budget's core themes are employment, skilling, MSME development, and support for the middle class.Largely focus has remained intact on spending money judiciously to ensure that each penny spent creates a ripple effect in the entire economic landscape.Although at first glance, manufacturing might appear to have taken a backseat, a deeper analysis reveals a multifaceted approach to bolstering the sector. Initiatives like employment-linked benefits and internship programs, while primarily aimed at job creation and skill development, indirectly benefit manufacturing companies by expanding the talent pool.Extensive focus on the MSME manufacturing units by way of extending term loan facility for purchase of machinery and equipment without collateral or third-party guarantee, would help companies in augmenting their capital base/ capacity and strengthen the very foundation of the manufacturing ecosystem in the country. Development of a new credit-assessment model by Public Sector Banks to assess MSME credit shall provide much needed regulatory relief to the units.With respect to the large manufacturing entities, while there is no direct fiscal/ tax incentive introduced in this budget, some support has been provided with an extensive focus on development of ‘industrial parks’ in nearly 100 cities under the ‘plug and play’ model. Reforms proposed with respect to land administration, planning and management, shall also ease out acquisition related difficulties often faced by entrepreneurs/ business houses in acquiring lands for manufacturing set-ups.Targeted Customs duty interventions like, rationalization of Customs duty provisions in Mobile phone manufacturing setups, extension of Customs duty exemption on import of capital goods for manufacturing of solar cells and panels, full Customs duty exemption on import of 25 critical minerals,, shall provide the required impetus for enhancing domestic manufacturing environment.Governments’ focus on formulating an Economic Policy Framework to set the scope for next-gen reforms in the country, has a target to improve the productivity of factors of production, namely, land, labour, capital, entrepreneurship and technology. This shall pave the way for enabling achievement of a target of 25% manufacturing sector contribution to the nation’s GDP over the course of next 7-10 years.While the overall outlook is positive, the extension of tax benefits under Section 115BAB for manufacturing entities and the absence of new PLI schemes are notable omissions.The country’s manufacturing base is expanding as is reflective from the continuously increasing tax collections and expanding Purchasing Manager’s Index. It would be pertinent to see how the ground realities evolve vis-à-vis the vision envisaged, in the upcoming Financial Year.","While the overall outlook is positive, the extension of tax benefits under Section 115BAB for manufacturing entities and the absence of new PLI schemes are notable omissions.

Budget 2024: Armed with the vision to propel India to become a developed country by 2047, the Union Budget 2024 aims to focus largely towards strengthening the Make in India initiative and ease of doing business thereby providing the required stimulus to the manufacturing sector and enabling large scale job creation.On the Indirect tax front, the industry welcomes the much-needed announcement for a comprehensive review of the rate structure under Customs enabling ease in product classification and dispute reduction. The proposal of lowering of Customs duty on a plethora of raw materials and products including solar cells, critical minerals and bullion are encouraging measures. The rationale behind such reduction clearly indicates support towards domestic manufacturing, deepening value addition and supporting targets in reducing carbon footprint.Relevant amendments under the Customs law have been made to provide increased time limits for re-imports and re-exports to enhance competitiveness of the fledgling MRO sector. The government has extended significant duty reduction and exemption benefits to the healthcare and electronics sectors, continuing the impetus of incentives provided under the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme.Since their introduction in March 2020, the PLI schemes have indeed supported in revitalizing the manufacturing sector and strengthening the necessary supply chains. The success achieved in the mobile manufacturing sector has now enabled the Government to reduce customs duties on mobile phones and components, signalling a mature environment. The Budget proposals aim at reproducing similar outcomes for semiconductor and pharmaceutical industry by increasing the budgetary allocation.Buoyed by the increasing revenue collection under GST signalling a shift towards a mature tax regime, this Budget has harmonized the timeframes for the issuance of demand notices and adjudication orders for cases involving fraud, suppression or otherwise. Significant amendments to the GST legislations have been introduced reflecting the recommendations proposed by the GST Council such as regularizing non-levy of GST due to general practice which may turn out to be a breather for certain impacted industries reeling under huge tax demands.The Insurance sector has been provided much relief through the GST council recommendations which have been cemented in the present budget thereby ending long standing disputes on their business practices.The Government's efforts to push forward with its reform agenda are evident as plans to incentivize states for their business reform actions plans and digitalization through the Jan Vishwas Bill 2.0 is proposed. Further, setting up of e-commerce export hubs is envisaged to facilitate easier access to international markets for domestic players.The recent implementation of Budget proposals allows the government to maintain momentum in its reform agenda. These policy measures implicitly reaffirm the significance of India Inc as a crucial element in the development of infrastructure. However, there are still some expectations required to be met to march towards a Viksit Bharat 2047.","Union Budget 2024 aims to focus largely towards strengthening the Make in India initiative.

Budget 2024 : Real estate, a significant contributor to employment generation, has received a fair bit of attention in Budget 2024-25. Recent years have seen the sector transform rapidly, driven by factors such as favourable government policies, Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016, strong economic growth and changing consumer preferences.Added to that, the budgetary focus on job creation, skilling and employment-linked incentives, infrastructure, urban development, rural connectivity, digitalisation and land-related norms, all dovetail to promote growth of the sector.Launched in June 2015, the PMAY aims to provide affordable housing to all eligible beneficiaries. The budget unveiled PMAY Urban 2.0, under which the housing needs of 1 crore urban poor and middle class will be addressed with an investment of Rs 10 lakh crore.The central government’s additional Rs 2.2 lakh crore injection in the next 5 years to make housing more affordable has the potential to revitalise the affordable housing market.Such an approach can play an important role in realising the government's vision of Housing for All and push growth and development. Hence, the significant investment under PMAY Urban 2.0 is expected to alleviate urban housing deficits, spurring construction and economic growth.Steps to introduce technological reforms within the regulatory framework for land, such as digitalisation or GIS mapping of land records, will improve transparency.Rationalisation of stamp duty across states will also be critical to bring in uniformity and initiate land-related reforms such as urban planning, usage and building bylaws.These are steps in the right direction and will boost growth. Moreover, they will improve the ease of property transactions and strengthen municipal finances through increased property taxes. Rationalization of stamp duty with an emphasis on women homebuyers may boost home-buyer sentiment in major cities, too.The budget has also given ample attention to urban and rural development, with rental housing for industrial workers through the public private partnership model, interest subsidies for rental housing, and transit-oriented developments.The proposal to develop investment-ready plug-and-play industrial parks in 100 cities may attract industrial investment, leading to increased demand for industrial real estate and support the growth of ancillary services and residential developments in these regions.Initiatives for industrial parks and rental housing for industrial workers align with the country’s manufacturing goals and addresses worker accommodation needs.These steps are expected to promote industrial growth and stability in labour-intensive sectors, while also creating new opportunities for real estate developers specialising in rental and affordable housing.The changes in long-term capital gains (LTCG) tax, however, have evoked a mixed reaction. The government lowered the long-term capital gains tax from 20% to 12.5%, which is a welcome step. However, this came with the removal of the indexation benefit.The changes could encourage more liquidity in property transactions and potentially increase the effective tax burden depending on the property’s acquisition date.The launch of Phase IV of the PM Gram Sadak Yojana in 25,000 rural habitations will improve connectivity in rural areas, promoting rural development and making these regions more accessible for investment. The primary objective of PMGSY is to build robust, all-weather roads in rural habitations. This initiative focuses on enhancing connectivity and supporting economic development in rural areas.In essence, the budget is geared towards stimulating growth and investment in the real estate sector , fostering a more transparent and investor-friendly environment, and contributing to overall development. It aims to create a balanced and inclusive growth environment by addressing the needs of various segments, including affordable housing, industrial workers and urban infrastructure.The effectiveness of the initiatives, however, hinges on their implementation and continued support of complementary reforms.",The central government’s additional Rs 2.2 lakh crore injection in the next 5 years to make housing more affordable has the potential to revitalise the affordable housing market.

New Budget 2024 rule: Why Income Tax Department is likely to issue a huge number of tax notices this month,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/new-budget-2024-rule-why-income-tax-department-is-likely-to-issue-a-huge-number-of-tax-notices-this-month/articleshow/112186079.cms,"Taxing Times

Income Tax Notice on the way? The Income Tax Department is gearing up to send out a large number of notices in the coming month, as there are concerns that many taxpayers might escape the tax net due to the impending implementation of the new reassessment law on September 1, 2024.According to the amended regulation announced in Budget 2024 , the tax authorities can only go back a maximum of five years to reassess a taxpayer's records if the escaped income is at least Rs 50 lakh, and three years for an amount less than Rs 50 lakh.Previously, they could reassess cases up to 10 years old.According to an ET report, tax officials are now faced with the challenge of compiling and corroborating data on tax and income mismatches for the financial years 2013-14 to 2017-18 within the next few weeks, as these years will become time-barred for reassessment from September 1, 2024.The I-T department relies on information from various sources, such as banks, property registrars, and search findings from the investigation wing, to build reassessment cases.A tax officers' body has raised concerns about the feasibility of issuing notices under Section 148 (or 148A) in a large number of cases within a single month, given the overburdened nature of the jurisdictional assessing officers and the time-consuming process of obtaining sanction from the chief commissioner, who is the specified authority for such notices.Moreover, the law provides taxpayers with the right to explain their position before reassessment orders are finalized, a process that most believe cannot be completed by the end of August.Also Read | ITR refund status for FY 2023-24: How to check income tax refund status online - here’s a step-by-step guide for incometax.gov.in & NSDL websites The Central Board of Direct Taxes ( CBDT ) has been urged by its officers to postpone the effective date of the proposed amendment. However, this suggestion is unlikely to be well-received by corporations and high net worth individuals.""Capping the reassessment period at five years was a great decision as it would reduce hassles and litigation. But if the department fears there could be a genuine loss of revenue as it may not be possible to wrap up several matters by August 31, the government can think of strict parameters where time-bound cases can be selectively reopened - based on trails of steps taken in identifying escaped income,"" said Mitil Chokshi, partner at CA firm Chokshi & Chokshi.""Taxpayers may expect a rush of reassessment notices in August 2024. These notices are likely to be for the AYs 2018-19 and prior to that. It is pertinent to note that the Bombay High Court in a recent ruling in a case of Hexaware Technologies has taken a view on a proviso introduced in 2021, which can be interpreted to mean that AY 2017-18 (and prior years) got time barred on March 31, 2024. These reassessment notices (for AYs 2017-18 and prior) are likely to rake up new interpretation issues in the already muddled reassessment provisions,"" said Ashish Mehta, partner at law firm Khaitan & Co.The current situation is similar to the conflict between the Income Tax office and taxpayers in 2021. The reassessment law was amended in April 2021, allowing the tax office to reopen 10-year-old tax returns if the total undisclosed income exceeded Rs 50 lakh and reassess 4-year-old matters if the amount was less than Rs 50 lakh.Also Read | Latest NPS rules 2024: How much tax will you save with new NPS contribution benefit under new regime after Budget 2024? However, this change led to over 10,000 writ petitions being filed by companies, arguing that they were not given sufficient time to explain and that the notices were issued without considering the carve-out that cases which couldn't be reopened earlier couldn't be reassessed under the new law.The Supreme Court invoked its extraordinary powers under Article 142 of the Constitution on May 4, 2022, to uphold all reassessment notices issued after March 31, 2021. However, the court left room for judicial proceedings based on the merits of each case, and several such matters are currently pending before the court.","The Income Tax Department is gearing up to send out a large number of notices in the coming month.

How NPS will increase tax savings

NPS and EPF: Overlapping services

What is NPS Vatsalaya?

Latest NPS rules, news: In the Union Budget 2024 speech, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced two new initiatives with regard to National Pension Scheme (NPS) - extension of NPS 14% employer contribution benefits to private setcor and the intended launch of NPS Vatsalya.Budget 2024 announced the hiking of the tax deduction limit on private sector employers’ contributions to NPS from 10% to 14% of employees’ basic salaries, bringing it at par with the provisions available for government employees.Sriram Iyer, CEO, HDFC Pension Management told ET that with this move the “ground rules have been harmonised among government and non-government employees, which is a positive step.”Effectively, this means that now, private-sector employees can choose to reduce the taxable portion of employers’ contribution to their NPS corpus, thereby paying less tax and leaving greater funds in their pension deposits.“Employees will benefit from tax savings . More importantly, the 40% increase in contribution will have a significant impact on the terminal value of the retirement corpus,” remarked Iyer. The extended savings will “help in retirement planning, working as an option that is at par with the Provident Fund,” Dinesh Rohira, CEO & Founder, 5nance.com was quoted as saying.Moreover, the endeavour aims to increase NPS penetration by increasing tax incentives for the private sector, providing them a social security-cushion post-retirement.The scheme’s motive to widen the NPS subscriber base may not prove to be flawlessly effective, however. This is explained by Agrees Mrin Agarwal, Founder, Finsafe India: “While it’s good that the limit has been raised, it may not increase adoption as employees need to be educated in a big way. Also, the benefit is only for the salaried opting for the new tax regime,” she says.The mandatory contribution to the EPF, too, threatens to relegate the provisions of NPS under the umbrella of near-superfluity. This sentiment is echoed by Varun Sahay, a software engineer in a Delhi-based IT company: “When 12% of my salary is already deducted for the EPF, why should I put in more in the NPS and cut my take-home pay?”Rohira feels otherwise. “There’s no competition between the NPS and EPF as employees can contribute to both and build a 3-4 times bigger corpus while earning 3-4% higher returns via marketlinked options in the NPS,” he counters.Also Check | New Tax Regime 2023 vs 2024 After Budget: How Much Income Tax Will Salaried Taxpayers Save & How Do New Tax Slabs Compare To Old Regime? Top 10 Points You Must Know To jumpstart retirement savings for children, a new initiative called NPS Vatsalya has been unveiled in the Budget. This scheme allows parents and guardians to contribute to a minor's account, which can be converted into a regular NPS account once the child reaches adulthood.""It provides a very long duration for reaping the compounding benefits and accumulating a huge bounty at a later age. This can be a good way to plan a better future for kids who may not opt for a service segment in the future,"" says Rohira. Sriram Iyer agrees, stating, ""It’s a good move to help the child start his retirement journey. Even if a parent starts when the child is 10 years old, by the time he starts working, it can be a solid foundation for the compounding journey after that.""However, some experts question the utility of a product with such a long lock-in period, especially when parents cannot use the funds for essential goals like their child’s education amidst soaring education costs of 11-12%.""Parents are struggling to save for their own retirement, so it might be a bit of a stretch to expect them to save for their kids’ retirement. The need of the hour is a market-linked product that allows withdrawals only for the child’s education,"" says Mrin Agarwal, Founder of Finsafe India.Also Read | Latest NPS rules 2024: How much tax will you save with new NPS contribution benefit under new regime after Budget 2024? Though the NPS permits partial withdrawals, it allows only 25% of the corpus after three years of joining, and this can be done only three times during the entire tenure. A premature exit before 60 years with 100% withdrawal is only possible if the corpus is less than Rs.2.5 lakh, an amount insufficient for most children's goals.""In its current form, there won’t be any uptake,"" asserts Agarwal. Rohira concurs, ""It’s a vanilla product with a lock-in, which does not make it very attractive and it may not take off. However, the government may optimise it and introduce new features later."" Iyer adds, ""This is just a start and there may be more subscriber-friendly features as we take it to the market. The regulator is proactive and open to feedback.""","Budget 2024 announced the hiking of the tax deduction limit on private sector employers’ contributions to NPS from 10% to 14% of employees’ basic salaries.

Gold import duty cut: Why Indians may not find buying gold from Dubai as attractive post Budget 2024,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gold-import-duty-cut-why-indians-may-not-find-buying-gold-from-dubai-as-attractive-post-budget-2024/articleshow/112097671.cms,"Gold import duty cut: Joy Alukkas, chairman of Joy Alukkas Group, estimates that nearly 50% of their UAE business will shift to India.

Gold import duty cut in Budget 2024: The recent reduction in customs duty on gold imports in the Union Budget 2024 is expected to significantly impact the gold shopping habits of Indian consumers who frequently visit Dubai. Indian jewellers with stores in both India and the UAE believe that the narrowed duty differential will result in lower gold prices in India, making it less attractive for Indians to purchase gold in Dubai.The emirate had attracted gold-enthusiast Indians following a steep rise in customs duty in India in July 2022. In the fiscal 2024-25 budget, the duty on gold imports was more than halved.The duty cut is also expected to boost gold jewellery production in India, particularly the popular 'Kolkatti' jewellery from Kolkata, which is favored by Indian expats in Dubai and tourists from various countries. This move will encourage gold artisans to create new designs in both heavyweight and lightweight jewellery, attracting consumers to purchase gold from India.According to an ET report, Joy Alukkas, chairman of Joy Alukkas Group , estimates that nearly 50% of their UAE business will shift to India as Indian tourists who previously bought jewellery in Dubai will now prefer to shop in India. However, Indian expats living in Dubai and other customers may continue to buy from the UAE.Also Read | Gold losing sheen? Government cuts gold bond issuance target as investors look at better alternatives Rajiv Popley, director at Popley & Sons, believes that the perception of overseas gold being cheaper than in India is merely a mindset. He points out that the labour cost is significantly lower in India, and with the introduction of mandatory hallmarking and HUID numbers, the purity of gold in India is no longer a concern.Furthermore, NRIs in Dubai do not receive VAT refunds, and Indians travelling abroad only receive about 60% of the VAT back on their gold purchases. Gold trade analyst Bhargav Baidya suggests that the 1% duty differential between gold jewellery in India and Dubai will be offset by Indian jewellers offering discounts to retain and attract customers.Saurabh Gadgil, chairman of PNG Jewellers, notes that Indian import duty is now on par with the US, allowing Indian jewellers to offer competitive prices compared to other countries worldwide. The reduced customs duty is expected to make gold purchases in India more attractive and convenient for Indian consumers, potentially leading to a significant shift in their gold shopping preferences.","The reduction in customs duty on gold imports in the Union Budget 2024 is expected to significantly impact the gold shopping habits of Indian consumers.

Gold Bonds losing sheen

Gold losing sheen? The government has reduced its target for issuing gold bonds in the financial year 2024-25 by 38% compared to the previous interim budget goal, according to a senior official. The revised target stands at Rs 18,500 crore, down from Rs 29,638 crore estimated in the interim budget and Rs 26,852 crore (revised estimate) in 2023-24.The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told ET ""The decision followed a reassessment of various factors, including investor demand, other investment products and uncertainties around the global economy, as the situation has changed since the interim budget in February.""After accounting for redemptions, the net issuances of sovereign gold bonds are now estimated at Rs 15,000 crore for this fiscal year, a significant decrease from the Rs 26,138 crore projected in the interim budget and Rs 25,352 crore in the revised estimate for 2023-24.Harish Galipelli, director at ILA Commodities India, attributed this shift to retail investors increasingly opting for equities in anticipation of better returns. He also noted that people are uncertain about the potential for further increases in gold prices in the short-to-medium term following a recent rally. Additionally, Galipelli pointed out that savings in rural areas have been impacted by retail inflation and other factors.The gold bond and gold monetisation schemes were introduced by the government in late 2015 to discourage the physical purchase of precious metals and reduce imports, thereby mitigating the negative impact on the current account deficit.The gross collection through these two schemes is now projected to be Rs 20,030 crore in 2024-25, compared to Rs 31,168 crore in the interim budget and Rs 28,240 crore (revised estimate) in the previous fiscal year. Similarly, the net collection is estimated at Rs 16,433 crore, down from Rs 27,571 crore in the interim budget and Rs 26,653 crore in the previous year. However, the estimates for the gold monetisation scheme remain unchanged from the interim budget level.Also Read | Budget 2024: Duty cuts on gold, silver, platinum, and diamonds to make jewellery more affordable The sovereign gold bond scheme targets investors who view gold as an investment, encouraging them to purchase paper gold instead of physical gold.On the other hand, the gold monetisation scheme aims to bring out idle gold held by households, temple trusts, and others to increase domestic supply. Both schemes were designed to curb gold imports, which, along with crude oil, have been significant contributors to India's current account deficit.

IPO dates and price band



NTPC Green Energy Ltd (NGEL), a fully owned subsidiary of NTPC Ltd, is set to launch its initial public offering IPO ) on Tuesday, November 19. As of September 2024, it stands as the largest renewable energy public sector enterprise (excluding hydro energy) in terms of operating capacity.In SBI’s latest securities report, experts suggest subscribing to the IPO at the cut-off price, which is guaranteed by the company's significant growth potential and promising long-term returns.The report said, “We recommend investors to subscribe to the issue at cut-off price for long term.” However, the report also warns that NGEL financial performance could be impacted by the timely completion of its contracted projects.According to reports, the company aims to raise Rs 10,000 crore through this initial offering. The company is largely dependent on a small group of power purchasers, who have contributed over 97 per cent of its revenue in recent years.The subscription period for the IPO opens on November 19, 2024, and closes on November 22, 2024. The price band is set between Rs 102 and Rs 108 per share.At the upper price band of Rs 108 per share, NGEL is valued at an FY24 EV/EBITDA multiple of 53.4x. Considering the company's strong growth potential, analysts suggest subscribing to the IPO at the cut-off price for long-term benefits, news agency ANI reported.Additionally, returns are heavily dependent on imported solar panels and other components, which lack long-term contracts, making the company vulnerable to potential supply chain disruptions.The report says that the company is majorly dependent on the availability and cost of components of its solar, wind and other projects including solar modules, solar cells, wind turbine generators and other materials.“The company purchases major components such as solar panels, inverters, wind turbines and some components of power evacuation systems directly from a number of domestic and international manufacturers and does not have any long term supply contracts with them,"" the report said.It also suggests investors should also take into account risks such as the high concentration of NGEL's operational projects in Rajasthan (62.2 per cent), which makes the company susceptible to regional vulnerabilities.""The company is dependent for winning competitive bids for renewable energy projects which require extensive research, planning, due diligence and capacity to operate with low operating margins for sustained period of time. Future growth of the company is significantly dependent on successful execution of contracted & awarded projects.”It also highlighted that business, operation results and financial stability of the company may be adversely affected by any cost-overruns or failure to successfully execute projects.The company's operational capacity stands at 3,220 MW of solar and 100 MW of wind projects, as of September 2024.Additionally, it has 13,576 MW of contracted and awarded projects, along with 9,175 MW in the pipeline. The company also plans to expand its operational capacity to 19 GW by FY27, as a part of its growth strategy.NTPC Ltd, a 'Maharatna' central public sector enterprise, accounts for 24 per cent of India's total power generation and has set a target to expand its renewable energy capacity to 60 GW by 2032.

What the investigation revealed

Citizens urge authorities to increase patrols

NEW DELHI: Six young lives, including three women, died in a high-speed collision at ONGC Chowk in Dehradun early Tuesday. The MUV they were traveling in rammed into a container truck, leaving the vehicle mangled.The sole survivor, 25-year-old Siddhesh Agrawal, is in stable condition but cannot speak.The victims, aged 19 to 24, included Guneet Singh, Kamakshi Singhal, Navya Goyal, Rishabh Jain, Atul Agrawal and Kunal Kukreja. They were returning from a party hosted by Siddhesh at his residence.Following the gathering, the group decided on a late-night drive, which ended in the fatal crash.Around 1:30am., the MUV, reportedly speeding at over 100 km/h, approached the busy ONGC Chowk.CCTV footage shows the MUV speeding at over 100 km/h and attempting to overtake a luxury car before misjudging the distance and slamming into the truck. The impact was so severe that the MUV's roof was torn off, killing six on the spot.Three of the deceased were students at a private university and one was an engineering graduate.The accident’s precise details remain partially unclear due to non-functional CCTV cameras at ONGC Chowk, offline after a ransomware attack. Dehradun Smart City Limited (DSCL) confirmed that out of 536 cameras in the city, 134 remain non-operational, including the one crucial to this case.Local authorities and police have cited the group’s excessive speed as the primary cause of the crash. The container truck driver fled the scene, though officials suggest he wasn’t at fault.Police investigations have also revealed that the MUV was being driven with an air of casual disregard for traffic norms, a pattern seen among many young drivers in the region.Read more: 'Non-functional CCTV' hampers probe into deadly Dehradun crash; FIR against unidentified person Police are consulting legal experts to determine potential actions in a tragic car crash that claimed six young lives, including three women and left one survivor, Siddhesh Agrawal, critically injured.Siddhesh, the sole survivor, is currently hospitalised with a severe head injury and remains unable to provide a statement.Preliminary investigations have revealed that the accident occurred when a speeding multi-utility vehicle (MUV) collided with the rear left section of a container truck, a blind spot for large commercial vehicles. Authorities have found no fault on the part of the truck driver.Complicating the legal process, the car’s owner, who was driving at the time of the crash, also lost his life in the incident. Police are exploring legal options in the absence of complaints from the victims' families.According to the initial investigation, the MUV, likely a new vehicle without number plates, was traveling from Ballupur Chowk towards Garhi Cantt when it was overtaken at high speed by a luxury car.In an attempt to catch up, the MUV driver accelerated. Meanwhile, a container truck was crossing the intersection at a steady pace.Misjudging the timing, the MUV driver believed they could clear the intersection before the truck passed. However, the speeding MUV collided with the truck’s rear left side, resulting in the fatal crash.In the wake of the accident, citizens are urging authorities to increase patrols near pubs and bars and establish more checkpoints to deter drunk driving.“There should be strict penalties for violators, regardless of their status or influence. Authorities must enforce measures against speeding, ensure helmet usage, and address the issue of multiple riders on two-wheelers. Pub and club owners should also be held responsible if intoxicated patrons leave their premises and attempt to drive,” said Radha Chatterjee, a member of the citizens’ forum.The forum has also advocated for the introduction of 'designated drivers' in Dehradun and has formally written to the director general of police, urging the immediate adoption of these safety measures to prevent further accidents.In response to public pressure, the administration has taken some steps to improve safety. The liquor licence of a five-star hotel on Mussoorie Road, which had been extended to allow 24-hour service, has now been rolled back to its original schedule.","Six young lives, including three women, died in a high-speed collision at ONGC Chowk in Dehradun early Tuesday. The MUV they were traveling in rammed into a container truck, leaving the vehicle mangled. The sole survivor, 25-year-old Siddhesh Agrawal, is in stable condition but cannot speak.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115353949,imgsize-831640,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/115353949.jpg"

TikTok's Chinese parent company ByteDance is valuing itself at about $300 billion after a recent buyback offer, the Wall Street Journal reported on Saturday, even as the tech giant's popular TikTok app faces the prospect of a looming ban in the U.S.The TikTok parent in recent days told investors it was looking to buy back shares at about $180 a share, the newspaper said.ByteDance investors have viewed President-elect Donald Trump’s return to the White House as an overall positive for TikTok’s hopes in the U.S., as per the report.At Bloomberg BusinessWeek interview in June, Trump said, ""I’m for TikTok because you need competition. If you don’t have TikTok, you have Facebook and Instagram."" Trump had previously called TikTok a national security threat but soon after he too joined the platform, which is used by about 170 million Americans.A law signed by U.S. President Joe Biden on April 24, gives ByteDance until Jan. 19 to sell TikTok or face a ban. The White House has said it wants to see Chinese-based ownership ended on national-security grounds but not a ban on TikTok.TikTok and ByteDance sued in U.S. federal court in May, seeking to block the law signed by Biden.Both TikTok and ByteDance did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.",TikTok's Chinese parent company ByteDance is valuing itself at about $300 billion after a recent buyback offer.

Even the IMF has read the amendments and is fine with them.""""If there is any breach then the IMF would have said that during the last two days' meetings,"" she added.Sources indicated that alongside Punjab, Sindh's government also violated the National Fiscal Pact, showing little commitment to implementation during IMF meetings.In a significant development, the finance ministry withdrew its October 31 report indicating Punjab government's Rs 160 billion budget deficit, which missed the Rs 342 billion cash surplus target.Pakistani authorities maintain that the IMF hasn't provided final conclusions regarding revenue shortfall solutions and will communicate requirements after consulting their Washington headquarters.","IMF has identified several challenges in implementing the $7 billion loan package to Pakistan, including tax collection shortfalls and delays in securing foreign loans.

Tech billionaire Elon Musk said on Friday that he appreciates major brands resuming advertising on his social media platform, X, after boycotting it due to 'brand safety' concerns. This comes after reports of several brands returning to the platform following US President-elect Donald Trump ’s victory and Musk’s appointment to lead the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).Social media personality Mario Nawfal shared on X that companies like IBM, Disney, Comcast, and Discovery have resumed advertising on the platform after a year-long boycott, citing a CNBC report.""IBM, Disney, Comcast, Discovery, Warner Bros, and Lionsgate Entertainment have reportedly resumed ad campaigns on 𝕏 after an almost year-long boycott. The return is attributed to @lindayaX's leadership, as she rebuilds trust and ad partnerships on the platform,"" Nawfal posted.Musk responded to Nawfal’s post, saying, ""Just want to say that we super appreciate major brands resuming advertising on our platform!"" He also expressed gratitude toward X CEO Linda Yaccarino and other team members for their efforts in restoring advertisers' confidence.""Thanks @lindayaX and the whole 𝕏 team for your hard work in restoring confidence in our platform and ensuring that advertising content only appears where advertisers want it shown,""Musk added.Advertiser support for X reportedly dropped by 24% in the first half of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, according to Tech Informed. The decline was attributed to concerns over ""brand safety"" following Musk’s takeover of the platform in October 2022.A September CNN report also suggested that more companies were considering pulling ads from X next year due to concerns that their brands could be harmed by the platform's content. A survey by market research company Kantar revealed that 26% more marketers plan to decrease their spending on X ads in 2025, marking the largest recorded decline in ad spending for any major global platform.Only 4% of marketers surveyed expressed confidence in X’s brand safety measures, compared to 39% for Google, according to CNN.","Elon Musk said on Friday that he appreciates major brands resuming advertising on his social media platform, X.

The company missed analyst’s estimates of 14.88 yuan weighted under domestic issues and reported an adjusted profit of 15.06 yuan per American Depository Share.Its US listed shares opened 0.3 percent lower.Chinese consumers are refraining from spending more, particularly on discretionary items, as the world's second-largest economy faces challenges in gaining momentum amid a property sector crisis and rising job insecurity among the youth. JD.com on Thursday also missed estimates for quarterly revenue.Alibaba reported revenue of 236.5 billion yuan ($32.72 billion) for the second quarter ending September 30, falling short of analysts' average estimate of 240.17 billion yuan, according to data compiled by LSEG.Revenue from Alibaba's Cloud Intelligence division surged 7 per cent to 29.61 billion yuan, with revenues from public cloud products growing in double digits and AI-related product revenue delivering triple-digit growth.M Science analyst Vinci Zhang, ""Traditionally Alibaba is very dominant in apparel sportswear and cosmetics and skincare, all of these are highly discretionary in nature I do think that these categories are impacted.""Alibaba is undergoing intense competition from discount-focused retailers like PDD Holdings' Pinduoduo and ByteDance-owned Douyin, which have attracted price-sensitive consumers with extremely low prices on a wide range of products, from headphones to sweaters.""This generative AI opportunity is the kind of chance that only comes once every 20 years,"" said CEO Eddie Wu, emphasizing Alibaba's significant investments in the sector. Another positive development was the growth of Alibaba's international e-commerce business, which saw a 29 per cent rise in revenue to 31.67 billion yuan, driven by increasing global demand for affordable goods from China.Alibaba has focused on improving the user experience on its Taobao and Tmall Chinese e-commerce platforms and has been investing in its 88VIP loyalty program, which offers special promotions to its 46 million members.In the past few months Alibaba's platforms have also begun allowing users to pay with rival Tencent's WeChat Pay, in a bid to reach new customers.Zhang said a majority of the revenue growth seen in the quarter was fueled by a ""much better than expected take-rate, so it has nothing to do with actual business growth.""Zhang added that the higher take-rate on domestic platforms implied a ""much more tepid growth"" in gross merchandise volume (GMV), a commonly used e-commerce metric for measuring sales.The shopping giant did not release total sales revenue for the period but said 45 brands - including Apple, Haier , Midea, and Xiaomi - each surpassed 1 billion yuan $138.62 million in GMV.","Alibaba reported revenue of 236.5 billion yuan ($32.72 billion) for the second quarter ending September 30, falling short of analysts' average estimate of 240.17 billion yuan.

The Hangzhou-based fintech company contributed 2.48 billion yuan ($343 million) to Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. 's profits.In March, Ant implemented substantial restructuring, establishing separate boards for its international, database and digital technology divisions to facilitate potential future separations. The organisation has increased its international presence to counterbalance domestic market slowdown.These changes followed billionaire Jack Ma's relinquishment of Ant's control last year. Chinese authorities concluded their internet sector regulation by imposing fines exceeding $1 billion on both Ant and Tencent Holdings Ltd. in July last year.For international expansion, Ant secured $6.5 billion in loans to replace an existing offshore credit facility, according to sources familiar with the matter in September.Ant's global operations developed its blockchain-powered treasury management system, Whale. Additionally, it collaborated with Singapore's DBS Group Holdings Ltd. on a treasury token initiative to enhance inter-account fund transfers.The organisation advanced in artificial intelligence, launching services including ""Zhixiaobao"", a lifestyle assistance application integrating meal ordering, taxi services and other functionalities within Alipay.In China, Ant is evaluating the sale of its Baihang Credit Co. stake whilst awaiting approval for a licence regarding Qiantang, as reported by Bloomberg in June.The company initiated a share buyback of up to 7.6% last year, allowing investors like Fidelity Investments and T.

Japan's economic growth decelerated in the third quarter following earthquake warnings that affected activities, as indicated by official data released on Friday, whilst Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba tries to revitalise the fourth-largest economy.The GDP increased by merely 0.2 per cent from July to September compared to the previous quarter, according to preliminary government figures. This slowdown was attributed to a ""megaquake"" alert in August and one of the most severe typhoons in recent decades.The figures aligned with market predictions but showed a decline from the revised 0.5 per cent growth in the preceding quarter.The annualised GDP growth stood at 0.9 per cent, considerably lower than the revised 2.2 per cent increase observed in April-June.Japan's chief cabinet secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi said on Friday that the government expects a ""gradual recovery"" of the economy, which has faced stagnation and deflation for decades.""Our country is at an important crossroads as it's about to transition into a growth-based economy driven by wage hikes and investment,"" he said, adding, ""To realise that, we will implement all possible economic and fiscal policies, including a package currently under consideration.""Despite leading the ruling coalition to its poorest general election performance in 15 years last month, Ishiba retained his position through a parliamentary vote earlier this week.The 67-year-old leader has announced government support plans for AI and semiconductor sectors, pledging over 10 trillion yen ($64 billion) by 2030.He aims to secure opposition party support this month for a draft supplementary budget containing new stimulus measures, reportedly including financial assistance for low-income households and families.Increased automotive spending, following production resumption after a domestic testing controversy, contributed to output growth during the quarter, news agency AFP reported.However, these gains were offset by Typhoon Shanshan and the ""megaquake"" alert, issued and subsequently withdrawn by the weather agency in August under a new warning system.This resulted in consumers stockpiling emergency provisions, causing rice shortages in supermarkets and numerous hotel cancellations during a major Japanese holiday period.Typhoon Shanshan's impact in the same month disrupted factory production and led to train and flight cancellations.","The GDP increased by merely 0.2 per cent from July to September compared to the previous quarter, according to preliminary government figures.

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market and other asset classes given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)

Stock market recommendations:Last week, the benchmark index Nifty began the week on a strong footing, supported by a series of positive macroeconomic and policy cues. The rally was largely attributed to S&P Global Ratings upgrading India’s sovereign outlook, which boosted investor sentiment around the country’s economic prospects.Additionally, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s announcement of next-generation GST reforms, expected to be implemented by Diwali, added further strength to the rally. These reforms are aimed at simplifying the tax regime and easing the burden on consumers and MSMEs, thereby fostering broader economic growth.The positive momentum continued through the week, pushing the index to a high of 25153 by Thursday. However, despite the strong upmove, Nifty was unable to decisively clear the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of the previous corrective move (from 25669 to 24337). This key resistance level led to profit-taking on Friday, resulting in the formation of a bearish candlestick with a long upper shadow, typically indicating selling pressure at higher levels.On the daily chart, the index has formed an Evening Star candlestick pattern, which is generally considered a bearish reversal signal. This, combined with the rejection at a crucial Fibonacci level, suggests that the bulls may be losing momentum, and a phase of consolidation or a corrective move could unfold unless fresh positive triggers emerge. Notably, during this pullback rally, the RSI failed to move past the 60 mark, indicating limited strength in momentum.Looking ahead, the 100-day EMA zone of 24650–24600 is expected to act as a key support area for the index. On the upside, the 25050–25100 zone will serve as a critical resistance. A decisive move beyond either of these levels could set the tone for the next directional trend in the index.Bank Nifty continued to underperform the broader market last week, reflecting ongoing weakness in banking stocks. After touching a weekly high of 56156, the index saw a sharp decline of over 1000 points, eventually closing at 55150, down 0.35% for the week. This decline led to the formation of a large bearish candle on the weekly chart, highlighting the dominance of sellers throughout the week.The relative weakness is also evident in the Bank Nifty/Nifty ratio, which has slipped to a 65-day low, underscoring the sector’s lag compared to the broader market. From a technical standpoint, the index is now trading below its 20-day and 50-day EMAs, both of which are trending downward — a sign of weakening short- to medium-term momentum.Adding to the cautious outlook, the daily RSI is nearing the 40 mark, indicating fading internal strength and increasing downside risk. Unless a strong reversal or positive trigger emerges, the index may remain under pressure in the near term.Looking at key levels, the 54900–54800 zone will act as immediate support. A sustained move below 54800 could open the door for further downside toward 54300, followed by the 200-day EMA at 53544. On the upside, the 55600–55700 zone will serve as a crucial resistance area for the index.The stock has broken out of a falling channel pattern last week, signalling a potential trend reversal. The breakout was accompanied by strong volume, lending credibility to the move. On the weekly chart, the stock has formed a sizeable bullish candle — its first significant positive close since May 2025, indicating renewed buying interest.Technically, the stock has also moved above its key moving averages on both the daily and weekly timeframes, reinforcing the bullish setup. Additionally, the daily RSI is hovering near the 60 mark, suggesting improving momentum. Overall, the combination of pattern breakout, volume confirmation, and improving momentum indicators points to a positive short-term outlook for the stock. Hence, we recommend to accumulate the stock in the zone of 466-462 level with a stoploss of Rs 445. On the upside, it is likely to test the level of 510 in the short term.Last week, the stock witnessed a breakout from a Stage-2 cup pattern on the daily chart, supported by robust volume, confirming strong buying interest. This breakout marks a significant technical development, especially as the stock is now trading near its all-time high, reflecting strong bullish sentiment.From a trend perspective, the stock is well-positioned above all its key moving averages on both the daily and weekly timeframes, indicating a well-established uptrend. Moreover, momentum indicators are aligned with the bullish view, with the RSI firmly in bullish territory across both timeframes, suggesting sustained strength and room for further upside.Given the combination of pattern breakout, volume confirmation, and strong momentum, the stock appears poised for continued outperformance in the near term. Hence, we recommend to accumulate the stock in the zone of 225-223 level with a stoploss of Rs 215. On the upside, it is likely to test the level of 250 in the short term.","According to Sudeep Shah, Head - Technical Research and Derivatives, SBI Securities, Apollo Tyres, and Nykaa are the top stock picks for this week.

Here’s the outlook",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gold-price-prediction-today-where-are-gold-rates-headed-on-august-26-2025-and-in-the-near-term-mcx-gold-outlook/articleshow/123515279.cms,"Gold price prediction: Gold needs to take out strong resistance at $3,410 to target the next resistance at $3,450. Support is at $3346 (Rs 99,800)/$3319 (Rs 98,900). (AI image)

Praveen Singh, Senior Fundamental Research Analyst- Currencies and Commodities at Mirae Asset Sharekhan shares his views on gold price outlook and what levels investors should watch out for:

Gold Performance:

The Fed Chair Powell’s dovish flip in his much-awaited speech at Jackson Hole Symposium on August 22 as he shifted his focus from inflation to the US job market, boosted odds of a September rate cut. Consequently, gold staged a strong U-turn recovery on Friday to close 1% higher at $3,372. The metal posted a gain of 1.1% in the week ending August 22.

At the time of writing this article on August 25, spot gold was changing hands at $3,374, up by $2 for the day, while the MCX October gold contract at Rs 100,665 was up 0.28%.

Powell’s speech at Jackson Hole Symposium:

Powell, in his much-awaited speech on ‘economic policy outlook and Fed’s framework review’ at the Wyoming Conference said that the shifting risk situation may warrant downward adjustment in rates as he noted that the labor market is in a curious kind of balance resulting from a marked slowdown in both the supply of and demand for workers. He cited huge downward revision in two-month data in July nonfarm payroll report. He added that tariff impacts being visible now and likely to be short-lived, downside risks to employment are rising and can materialize quickly in the form of sharply higher layoffs and rising unemployment.

Geopolitics watch:

US-Venezuela: The US has deployed three warships, carrying 4,000 sailors and Marines, to the southern Caribbean to combat drug cartels in the region. However, the US action has alarmed the socialist Government of Venezuela’s Maduro as earlier this month Trump’s attorney general doubled the bounty on Maduro’s head to $50 million. Maduro, in retaliation, has announced the deployment of 4.5 million militiamen throughout the national territory and has called on China as pressure mounts.

Israel-Yemen: The Israeli military bombed the Yemeni capital Sanaa on Sunday in attacks that targeted an oil facility, a presidential palace, and a power plant in Sanaa. Israel targeted Iran-backed Houthis in its attacks.

Fed Watch:

On August 22, the Justice department urged the Fed Chair Powell to remove the Fed Governor Lisa Cook alleging her involvement in a mortgage fraud, though only the president has the power to remove a Fed Governor. Reportedly, Trump would prefer to see Cook resign or be fired by Powell.

Trade and tariffs:

President Donald Trump said his administration has begun a “tariff investigation” into furniture imports as they plan to levy duties on such goods in the next 50 days, though he did not specify a potential rate he would charge.

US tariff rates of 50% on India become effective from Wednesday.

Swiss Post will follow other countries in temporarily halting the delivery of goods to the US as the Trump administration eliminated a tariff loophole for so-called “de minimis” merchandise. Such packages, with a retail value of no more than $800, will cease to be exempted from Aug. 29, according to a White House fact sheet.

Data roundup:

US New home sales (July) came in at 652K Vs the forecast of 630K, which is somewhat positive for the US Dollar.

The German IFO Business Climate Index rose from 88.60 in July to 89 in August.

Dollar Index and yields:

The US Dollar Index and yields plunged on the Fed Chair Powell's speech on Friday. The Dollar Index slumped 0.90% to 97.72. Ten-year US yields fell 1.71% to 4.26% on August 22, while 2-year yields slumped 2.74% to 3.69%. However, Dollar and yields recovered some of the lost ground on Monday. The US Dollar Index, at the time of writing this report, was hovering at 98.11, up around 0.40% for the day, as the US yields rose. Two-year and ten-year US yields at 3.73% and 4.28% respectively were up by 3 bps each.

Gold ETF:

As of August 22, total known global gold ETFs stood at 92.366 MOz, near a 2-year high and up over 11% YTD.

Upcoming data:

Major US data on the cards this week include, durable goods orders (August 26), Conference Board Consumer Confidence (August 26), Q2 GDP secondary reading (August 28), PCE Price Index (August 29) and University of Michigan sentiments and inflation expectations (August 29).

Key Eurozone data include retail sales (August 29); Eurozone's consumer confidence (August 28); and France GDP and payrolls (August 29).

Gold Price Outlook:

The Fed Chair Powell’s focus shifting from inflation to jobs has paved the way to a September rate cut, which is a positive development for gold – a non-yielding asset. In addition, Powell’s concerns about rising risks for the US job market and the economy also support the yellow metal. Investors expect two/three rate cuts in the remaining part of the year.

August’s payroll and CPI reports will be crucial as investors will parse these reports for any hitches to the Fed’s possible rate cut in September.

Gold needs to take out strong resistance at $3,410 to target the next resistance at $3,450. Support is at $3346 (Rs 99,800)/$3319 (Rs 98,900).

Indian refiners’ crude oil procurement from Russia is set to reduce in the coming weeks, albeit modestly.

The adjustment is subtle, and India has made it clear that it will continue to purchase crude oil from Russia to secure its national interests.Major state-operated and private processors, including Reliance Industries Ltd, are projected to purchase between 1.4 million and 1.6 million barrels daily for October loading and subsequent months, sources familiar with the situation told Bloomberg.This is a reduction from the first half of the year's average procurement of 1.8 million barrels per day.The Trump administration, determined to decrease its trade imbalance with India, has intensified its stance regarding India's oil trade with Russia.The US has also accused India of indirectly financing Russia’s war with Ukraine.India's oil trade volumes could change if a trade agreement is reached with Trump and if the US changes its stance against India for its Russia trade ties, sources were quoted as saying.Also Read | Explained: How will Donald Trump’s tariffs impact India’s exports to US?

US government officials have intensified their public criticism, focusing particularly on India's oil firms.In response to allegations concerning profits from Russian crude oil, External affairs minister S Jaishankar recently said, ""It's funny to have people who work for a pro-business American administration accusing other people of doing business. If you have a problem buying oil or refined products from India, don't buy it. Nobody forces you to buy it.

NEW DELHI: A day before the Trump administration’s 25% secondary tariff on Indian exports — imposed over India’s Russian oil purchase — comes into force, a senior US embassy official on Tuesday said Washington remains committed to expanding energy ties with India.""As we look into the future, the US remains committed to working with India through the export of high quality work-class products and services, to help India achieve its goals of energy security and economic growth,"" Xiabing Feng, principal commercial officer at the embassy, said at an Indo-American Chamber of Commerce event.In line with India's energy security goals, the US can be a key partner in oil & gas and nuclear power space. In particular, the US can become a major supplier of oil and liquefied natural gas to India, she said.She pointed to “vulnerabilities” arising from the “profound transformation in the global energy landscape, geopolitical instability and supply chain disruptions” to underline the importance for such collaboration.""The United States and India share a commitment to diversify energy resources and enhancing infrastructure.By elaborating American expertise in natural gas, nuclear energy and emerging energy technologies the United States can support India's ambitious goals for energy security and grid modernisation,"" Feng said.US oil accounts for 8% of India’s oil imports during the April-July period of 2025-26 financial year, up from 3% in the year-ago period. Import of US LNG has almost doubled to $2.4 billion in value during this period from $1.4 billion earlier. There is an uptick in LPG (liquefied petroleum gas) imports from the US, indicating efforts to diversify sourcing.In contrast, Russian crude currently accounts for 35% of India’s oil imports, rising from less than 1% before the Ukraine war. Indian refiners have been lapping up Russian barrels at discounts after western buyers shunned those barrels and the G7 (group of seven developed economies) imposed restrictions, including a price cap of $60 a barrel, after Moscow invaded Ukraine in 2022.Though China buys much more Russian oil, the Trump administration has singled out India by slapping the secondary tariff, doubling the total export levy to 50%. India has called out the tariff for double standard as the US continues to buy enriched uranium and fertilisers from Russia, while the EU sources gas.Indeed, India has said that its purchase of Russian crude, in addition to volumes procured by China, the largest buyer, has helped stabilise global oil prices by freeing up West Asian supplies — still its mainstay — for Europe.",The US can be a key partner in oil & gas and nuclear power space.

Hansalpur: Maruti and its Japanese parent Suzuki Motor on Tuesday said they will invest Rs 70,000 crore in India over the next 5-6 years, but added that localising batteries for fully-electric cars remains a challenge in the absence of lithium-ion reserves.As the company rolled out its first fully-electric vehicle, the eVitara, global president T Suzuki said the car will be initially exported to Japan and Europe before making its way to India. At the rollout of the green car, in the presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Suzuki said the company will be exporting the vehicle to over 100 countries, with India becoming the sole manufacturing base for the model.""This Gujarat facility, serving customers across India and global markets, will shortly become one of the world's largest automobile manufacturing hubs, with a planned capacity of one million units. Further, we chose this facility to manufacture the eVitara, our first battery electric, and make it as global production hub for this model. We will export this 'Made-in-India BEV' to over 100 countries, including Japan & Europe,"" he said.The company also started the production of the country's first lithium-ion battery and cell with electrode level localisation, that would be used for its hybrid vehicles.However, making bigger batteries for EVs remains a challenge, non-executive chairman R C Bhargava said.This is also making it difficult for the company to plan proper schedules for launch and scale up of eVitara in India.""Nobody is making EV battery cells in India. Production of battery cells is a very capital-intensive industry, and getting access to raw material (lithium ion) is a problem... this is one reason that deters people from making batteries in India. Or else you partner a Chinese company and give them a majority stake, and they assure you supplies.""President Suzuki said the company has a focus on sustainability and green, and will launch cars across various clean technologies.","Maruti and its Japanese parent Suzuki Motor on Tuesday said they will invest Rs 70,000 crore in India over the next 5-6 years.

She emphasized that the company's focus is on job transformation, not elimination.""AI is being introduced as a co-pilot to augment human capabilities, not replace them. While some roles may evolve or be redefined, our focus is on reskilling and upskilling employees to take on higher value tasks. We're committed to a responsible AI adoption strategy that prioritises employee growth and job transformation over job reduction,"" she said.Her comments come amid muted headcount growth in the IT sector. HCLTech's workforce shrank by 4,061 employees in the 2024-25 financial year, following a modest net addition of 349 in the year-ago period. The trend reflects a broader industry shift, with major IT firms reporting that revenue growth is no longer directly linked to headcount expansion. Its CEO and MD C Vijayakumar echoed this view earlier this year at the Nasscom Leadership Technology Summit, stating that companies are focusing on niche skills and encouraging developers to work with AI-powered copilots to drive faster delivery.With increasing use of low-code and no-code platforms, he stressed the need for employees to proactively pursue reskilling.On the macro outlook, Malhotra noted the persistence of global uncertainty. ""In the short run, we remain cautiously optimistic and believe that pockets of opportunities will continue to be available across our portfolio offerings. From a medium to long term perspective, we remain very bullish as technology cycles become shorter and enterprises need trusted partners like HCLTech to navigate these shifts,"" she said. Despite challenges, attrition at HCLTech stood at 13% in the 2024-25 financial year, with senior leadership attrition under 1%, one of the lowest in the sector.

Near future still looks bleak

It’s here — Trump’s 50% tariffs on India. So, where do India’s exporters go from here? For some of India’s biggest exporters, the answer is any which way that helps them survive the biggest business shock of their entrepreneurial career.spoke to companies across sectors for this story. Some companies trying to find solutions is sort-of-good news. The bad news is that finding alternatives won’t be easy, smaller exporters’ adjustment capacity is limited, and the negative impact on jobs in export companies is already visible.Agra-based Puran Dawar of Dawar Group is offering discounts to ensure old clients continue sourcing formal and smart casual footwear from his company. So is Israr Ahmed, director of Farida Group, one of India’s largest footwear exporters, with big brand international clients. The idea is to keep buyers engaged, lest they move to other suppliers.In Gurgaon, Sudhir Sekhri, a large garment exporter who also heads the Apparel Export Promotion Council, is willing to offer discounts till the tariff issue is “resolved”. Export contracts are being devised in a way that the discount will be withdrawn in case Trump decides to drop the additional 25% tariff.“If you can sell, sell it at cost, at least the incremental quantity,” said Pankaj Chadha, who leads the Engineering Export Promotion Council.“This is a temporary challenge. We will operate at zero margin for a few months and get a little hurt… but that is better than letting your client go away,” said Dawar.Dawar, aside from offering discounts, is scouting for opportunities outside America. He’s focusing on Russia and other CIS countries, as well as on Latin America. Another leather goods exporter, who did not want to come on record, said he had been to China at the start of the month, hoping to find buyers for some of his products.Jewellery makers such as Colin Shah are looking “inward”, trying to sell more in the domestic market. Arun Kumar Garodia, who runs Kolkata-based Corona Steel Industries, is also eyeing the domestic market, plus exploring markets in Latin America and Africa.Exporters know these aren’t easy options. As Garodia said: “A lot of products we export to the US don’t have so much demand in India. In markets like Africa, there are concerns with payments.” His best bet? That the 25% extra tariffs won’t last very long.Govt, too, is stepping in, at least in some sectors. It’s working towards connecting exporters with large global chains, hoping that some exports can be diverted. The Centre is also trying to assess from American buyers how the pain can be reduced for Indian exporters.Anand of Anand Inc, a Noida-based garments exporter, said that trade deals with the UK and the one proposed with EU will open new markets.FIEO director general Ajai Sahai, however, cautioned that diversification won’t be easy. China has already moved in a big way in markets such as Europe.From big exporters like Bharat Forge and Gokaldas to smaller players in Ghaziabad and Ambur, the last 20 days have been frantic — frontloading shipments to the US. Farida Group’s Ahmed said that his companies prioritised dispatches to American ports to beat the 50% tariff rate.Shrimp exporters have exported more in July and Aug to beat the tariff deadline. Same for gems and jewellery exporters, who wanted to ensure their supplies were sold at lower duties, so that those products can be on retail shelves before the holiday season.“T-shirts that cost $12 or $15 in US markets have been airlifted by buyers,” said Ashwani Aggarwal of Ludhiana-based Nahar Industries.But all these efforts won’t substantially reduce the hurt. As Aggarwal says, there’s no clarity on future orders from the US, because the 50% tariff is “too high”. The other problem is that buyers in alternative markets know Indian exporters are in a tough situation. As a garment-maker, who did not want to come on record, said, buyers in European countries will now drive a hard bargain.Unsurprisingly, the first adverse impacts on jobs and entrepreneurs are already showing.One fallout of large exporters hunting for alternative markets may be on smaller exporters, who will now have to compete with bigger domestic rivals for the same set of buyers.But more immediately, the bad story is playing out in jobs. Some dyeing units in Tirupur are now working five days a week, but if the tariff problem persists, supply cycles and demand for labour will have to be recalibrated, said a garment industry player, who spoke off the record.There are reports of looming layoffs in gems and jewellery and garment exporting companies. Overtime in some shrimp processing units in Andhra has stopped. A jewellery industry executive, who spoke off-record, said the number of contract workers employed is coming down because there are no new American orders. Exporters will hold on to permanent skilled workers until at least Dec, he said.But if Trump’s 50% tariff persists, things can get much worse.","India’s biggest exporters are offering discounts to ensure old clients continue sourcing formal and smart casual footwear from their company. The idea is to keep buyers engaged, lest they move to other suppliers. Some companies trying to find solutions is sort-of-good news.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123536687,imgsize-1622349,width-400,resizemode-4/123536687.jpg"

Mumbai: With the additional 25% tariff on India's exports to the US set to take effect from today, pushing the overall tariff rate to 50%, American brands and retailers are asking Indian exporters to move production of new orders to other manufacturing countries.""New orders for spring season that are yet to go on production lines are being asked to move to other countries of production. The other option buyers have given suppliers is to share the burden of the penalty. No customers (brands/retailers) have the appetite to absorb this,"" said Pallab Banerjee, MD at garment supplier Pearl Global which counts US companies Gap, Macy's and Kohl's among its clients. For orders that are already in production, brands are not asking exporters outright to make any changes on the ground but are making a similar demand of sharing the cost of added tariffs, Banerjee said.A 50% tariff puts India behind other major Asian garment manufacturing hubs such as Bangladesh and Vietnam which have been slapped with lower tariffs by the US. ""From the conversations we have had with US buyers this morning, it is clear that they are not ready to absorb 50% tariff and have asked suppliers to shift sourcing to other countries. If things are not resolved at the political level, there will be a major crisis,"" said Rahul Mehta, chief mentor at Clothing Manufacturers Association of India (CMAI), pegging India's total apparel exports to the US at $5.5-$6 billion annually.Big exporters will not take a major hit as they have facilities across global markets but the count of small exporters is much higher and they are staring at a complete collapse of business, said Mehta. ""Small exporters typically have a few customers, and they tend to be from the same country,"" Mehta added.

Mumbai: Enterprise retailers may soon find themselves in breach of India's new data-protection regime. At present, many ask shoppers to recite mobile numbers at billing counters to enrol them in loyalty schemes or send digital receipts. Though customers may consent, the act of speaking such details aloud in a public setting exposes personal data, falling foul of the law's requirement that firms put reasonable safeguards in place for data collection.Rules under the new Digital Personal Data Protection Act will require businesses to rethink how they collect and handle customer information such as mobile numbers, which they use as identifiers. This could disrupt conventional loyalty systems that rely on mobile numbers as identifiers.""Small process tweaks, such as replacing oral disclosure of mobile numbers with keypad entry, can significantly improve privacy safeguards. The law mandates that customers must be told why their data is collected, how long it will be stored, and when it will be deleted. Implied consent will no longer be valid - every consent must be explicit,"" said S Chandrasekhar, head of digital and cyber practice at K&S Partners, an intellectual property law firm.Businesses will also be barred from denying services if a customer refuses to share a mobile number, unless it is integral to the service, such as mobile top-ups or Digi Yatra. Retailers will have to offer alternatives like email receipts or physical copies. Even visitor entry systems will need clear disclosures on the purpose of collecting numbers and assurances that data will not be reused or sold.""The broader intent is not to disrupt business but to enforce accountability, ensuring data is used only for the stated purpose and then deleted,"" said Chandrasekhar. He added that this brings India in line with global norms such as the GDPR, reflecting the growing importance of personal data as a resource around which many large businesses are built.While enterprise retail are the ones that are working on dealing with the new law, the rules will also apply to visitor management systems, and housing societies that routinely collect numbers. This new laws will compel them to adopt system-driven methods.The Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Act, 2023 is the cornerstone legislation for data privacy while allowing responsible and lawful processing by organisations and the state. As of Aug 2025, the ministry of electronics and IT has released the draft DPDP Rules, 2025 to facilitate operationalisation of the Act.Personal data such as phone numbers may be retained only for the duration necessary to serve the original purpose, for up to three years from the last user interaction, or as otherwise provided in the rules. Once the purpose is met or consent is withdrawn, the data must be deleted. Organisations are also obliged to implement safeguards to prevent unauthorised collection, use, or leakage of consumer numbers.","New Digital Personal Data Protection Act will require businesses to rethink how they collect and handle customer information such as mobile numbers.

Mumbai: The higher US tariffs against select Indian imports to the world's largest economy that is set to kick off today, and no end in sight to the India-US impasse, spooked Dalal Street as investors pressed the sell button on Tuesday. In addition, Wednesday being a trading holiday also weighed on investor sentiment since any negative development for the market will have to be factored in after two days, on Thursday.These reasons pushed investors on a risk-off mode and as a result, sensex slid 849 points (1%) to close at 80,787 points. On the NSE, Nifty lost 256 points (1%) to close at 24,712 points. On both the exchanges, selling was across sectors except in the FMCG counters which gained on expectations of a major boost for these companies from the ensuing cut in GST rates, market players said.According to Vinod Nair of Geojit Investments, market sentiment turned cautious as the US penalty tariff deadline is set to expire. ""The persistent depreciation of the (rupee) is adding pressure and may further impact foreign institutional inflows. Investors are closely monitoring the govt's efforts to support economic growth, including proposed GST rate revisions and sector-specific relief measures for industries affected by higher tariffs,"" Nair wrote.The day's session left investors poorer by nearly Rs 4.5 lakh crore with BSE's market capitalisation now at Rs 449.5 lakh crore.The selling was led by foreign funds while domestic funds were big buyers in Tuesday's market.

Indian pharma resilient to potential US tariffs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/indian-pharma-resilient-to-potential-us-tariffs/articleshow/123530289.cms,"Representative Image (AI-generated)

Potential tariff on pharma imports into the US, while still under Section 232 investigation, is unlikely to impact the credit profiles of Indian pharma companies, India Ratings and Research (Ind-Ra) said.While the US contributes around 35 per cent to the total revenue for leading domestic pharma companies, this proportion has been steadily declining over the past few years due to price erosion and its impact on margins and returns, a company statement said.Ind-Ra believes that the low-cost, high-value proposition of Indian generic exports offers significant cost advantages to the US healthcare industry.Any tariffs imposed would likely be largely passed on to end-consumers, with limited absorption by Indian pharma companies. However, Ind-Ra believes there will be a short-term impact for the initial three to four months due to contracts, pricing, and efforts to maintain market share.“Most Indian pharma players have a generic business in the US market, earning thin operating profitability. However, Indian companies have a diversified revenue model and a healthy balance sheet. There is no major risk to liquidity in the sector (large cash balances- 10 per cent -11 per cent of revenues).Furthermore, most companies have sufficient headroom under debt covenants and diversified funding sources. Hence, any material impact from future tariffs to Indian pharma is highly unlikely,” says Vivek Jain, Director, Corporates, India Ratings & Research.","The US contributes around 35 per cent to the total revenue for leading domestic pharma companies.

Ethanol-blended petrol push: Car experts warn E20 petrol may reduce fuel efficiency by 2 to 5 percent; warn of long-term erosion impact,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/ethanol-blended-petrol-push-car-experts-warn-e20-petrol-may-reduce-fuel-efficiency-by-2-to-5-percent-warn-of-long-term-erosion-impact/articleshow/123496104.cms,".

How leading automakers reacted



The adoption of 20 per cent ethanol-blended petrol (E20) could lead to a 2-5 per cent reduction in fuel efficiency, depending on the type of vehicle, according to automotive industry experts.India is fast-tracking its shift to E20 fuel, a mix of 20% ethanol and 80% petrol, aimed at lowering carbon emissions and reducing reliance on imported crude oil. The nationwide rollout, initially scheduled for 2030, has been moved up to 2025.Engineers associated with major automakers said older vehicles that are not E20-compliant may experience long-term wear in components such as gaskets, fuel hoses, and pipes, though these issues are not expected to appear immediately.""There can be a drop in mileage ranging from 2-5 per cent, depending on the type of vehicle. This is purely because of the lower calorific value of ethanol compared to petrol,"" an expert, who requested anonymity, was quoted as saying by PTI.Earlier this month, the Oil Ministry clarified that claims suggesting E20 causes a “drastic” reduction in fuel efficiency are misplaced. The ministry noted that E10 vehicles have shown only marginal efficiency drops, saying, “for some manufacturers, vehicles have been E20 compatible from as far back as 2009.The question of any drop in fuel efficiency in such vehicles does not arise.""The ministry highlighted that vehicles tuned for E20 deliver better acceleration, a key factor in city driving, and that ethanol’s higher heat of vaporisation reduces intake manifold temperatures, increasing air-fuel mixture density and boosting volumetric efficiency.""Ethanol, being lower in energy density than petrol, results in a marginal decrease in mileage, estimated at 1-2 per cent for four-wheelers designed for E10 and calibrated for E20, and around 3-6 per cent in others,” the ministry said through a post on X earlier this month.Several reports indicate that many motorists are concerned about E20 fuel’s potential impact on fuel efficiency.A Public Interest Litigation (PIL) was filed in the Supreme Court last week, challenging the nationwide rollout of 20% ethanol-blended petrol (E20). The plea, submitted by advocate Akshay, contends that millions of vehicles, including cars and two-wheelers made before 2023 and some newer BS-VI models, are not designed to run on high ethanol blends.When approached for comments, Maruti Suzuki and Hyundai Motor India declined, while a Tata Motors spokesperson confirmed that their vehicles are E20-compliant.""E20 usage will not have any impact on engines of compliant vehicles, as the materials are tuned for it. However, in vehicles, which are not E20 compatible, there could be erosion of gaskets and fuel rubber hoses and pipes in the long term, but not immediately,” another spokesperson was quoted as saying by PTI.The government has been promoting E20 blending as part of a national programme aimed at reducing emissions and boosting farmers’ income through ethanol production from sugarcane and maize.","India is fast-tracking its shift to E20 fuel, a mix of 20% ethanol and 80% petrol.

US President Donald Trump’s attempt to dismissal Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook is expected to land in court, raising questions over the extent of presidential powers against the traditionally independent central bank.Legal experts say Trump’s claim that he can fire Cook, a Biden appointee, is legally weak but unprecedented. The Supreme Court has recently allowed presidents more authority to remove agency officials, but the Fed has never faced such a challenge.If Trump succeeds, the Fed’s political independence could be weakened, a shift economists warn may make it harder to curb inflation. Without independence, the central bank could be forced into politically driven decisions, pushing up borrowing costs for mortgages, car loans and businesses.“It's an illegal firing, but the president’s going to argue, ‘The Constitution lets me do it,’” said Lev Menand, a Columbia University law professor and author of a book on the Fed. “And that argument’s worked in a few other cases so far this year.”Menand added that the Supreme Court could effectively set new constitutional law in this case.Cook, who joined the Fed board in 2022, is likely to seek an injunction against Trump’s order so she can continue serving.That leaves the Fed in a difficult position.“They have their own legal obligation to follow the law,” Menand said.“And that does not mean do whatever the president says. ... The Fed is under an independent duty to reach its own conclusions about the legality of Lisa Cook’s removal.”Trump announced Cook’s dismissal late on Monday via a Truth Social post, claiming she was guilty of mortgage fraud.Cook immediately rejected the move, saying “President Trump purported to fire me ‘for cause’ when no cause exists under the law, and he has no authority to do so,” she said in an emailed statement.“I will not resign.”The fraud allegations were made last week by Bill Pulte, a Trump appointee at the agency regulating Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Pulte alleged Cook listed two primary residences, in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and Atlanta, in 2021 to secure better mortgage terms. Mortgage rates are generally higher on second homes or rentals.Cook has brought in Washington lawyer Abbe Lowell to represent her. Lowell said Trump’s “reflex to bully is flawed and his demands lack any proper process, basis or legal authority,” adding, “We will take whatever actions are needed to prevent his attempted illegal action.”Cook is the first Black woman to serve as a Federal Reserve governor. A Marshall Scholar, she studied at Oxford University and Spelman College, and has taught at Michigan State University and Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government.","US President Donald Trump's attempt to dismissal Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook is expected to land in court.

US to buy stakes in Lockheed Martin, Boeing?

The Donald Trump administration seems to be eyeing America’s top defence giants for a stake after it struck a deal with Intel last week. The US government is evaluating potential ownership stakes in defence industry firms, including Lockheed Martin Corp, US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has said.According to a Reuters report, Lutnick confirmed this development on Tuesday whilst supporting President Donald Trump's initiative for increased government involvement in American industry.""They're thinking about it,"" Lutnick told CNBC, citing Pentagon leaders, when asked if the administration was considering taking pieces of contractors such as Lockheed Martin, Boeing, or Palantir Technologies.Last week, the Trump administration revealed it had acquired nearly 10% ownership in the semiconductor manufacturer Intel.The US government had earlier stepped in to finalise Nippon Steel's acquisition of US Steel in June, securing what Trump referred to as a ""golden share"" that provides Washington control over its functions.A significant debate has emerged regarding defence procurement. According to Lutnick, Lockheed Martin derives 97% of its revenue from US government contracts, effectively functioning as a government extension.""There's a lot of talking that needs to be had about how do we finance our munitions acquisitions,” Lutnick saidLockheed Martin, whose shares increased by 1.7%, issued a statement confirming their ongoing positive collaboration with President Trump's administration to enhance national defence capabilities.Boeing's shares rose 2.1%, and Palantir's stock, after an initial minor decline of approximately 1%, demonstrated a 1.7% increase during New York's midday trading, the Reuters report said.The comments represent another instance of unprecedented White House involvement in private industry, with interventions typically reserved for wartime scenarios or for protecting crucial domestic enterprises during economic difficulties.Recently, the Trump administration also acquired ownership in MP Materials, a rare earths firm, and facilitated an agreement with Nvidia and AMD requiring them to share 15% of their revenue from Chinese sales of previously restricted chips.During his Monday address, Trump expressed his intention to increase government funding in robust American enterprises, despite concerns from opponents who suggest such governmental involvement could restrict business flexibility and market responsiveness, whilst raising questions about consumer implications.The extraordinary degree of federal government involvement in economic matters has led to surprising collaborations, including liberal US Senator Bernie Sanders supporting the investment in Intel.On Tuesday, Lutnick said that organisations seeking federal aid must be ready to interact with Trump.""If a company comes to the United States of America government and says: 'We need your help, we want to change everything' ... I think that's a question between the CEO and the president of the United States of whether he will listen to them and change the rules,"" he told CNBC, citing the Nvidia deal.""If we are adding fundamental value to your business, I think it's fair for Donald Trump to think about the American people,"" Lutnick added.","US to buy stakes in Lockheed Martin, Boeing?

US economy: Consumer confidence slips again in August; job market fears rise for eighth month,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-economy-consumer-confidence-slips-again-in-august-job-market-fears-rise-for-eighth-month/articleshow/123529222.cms,"American consumers became less confident of the US economy in August, as worries over the jobs market continuing to mount for the eighth month in a row.Figures released on Tuesday by the Conference Board showed that its consumer confidence index slipped to 97.4 in August from 98.7 in July, a 1.3-point decline. The reading, though modest, stayed within the same tight range recorded over the past three months and matched economists’ expectations.Short-term expectations for income, business conditions and employment also weakened, falling by 1.2 points to 74.8. Remaining well below the 80 mark, the figure is seen by many economists as a signal that recession risks are rising. Consumers’ assessment of current conditions edged down too, at 131.2 in August compared with 132.8 the month before.Despite unemployment and layoffs still being historically low, analysts say that the labour market has lost momentum this year, with increasing signs that job seekers are struggling.In July, US employers created only 73,000 jobs, far fewer than the 115,000 economists had forecast. Revisions to earlier figures for May and June erased another 258,000 jobs. The unemployment rate also crept up from 4.1% to 4.2%.The disappointing update shook financial markets and led US President Donald Trump to dismiss Erika McEntarfer, the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which publishes the monthly figures.Government data from June highlighted further weakness, with job openings falling to 7.4 million from 7.7 million in May. The number of workers quitting their jobs, a measure of confidence in finding new opportunities, also declined.More updates on the labour market are expected next week when August’s hiring and June’s job openings reports are released.The Conference Board added that mentions of inflation and high prices had risen again in August, often linked to tariffs. Separate data this month showed consumer prices were steady between June and July, but wholesale inflation jumped unexpectedly. Economists warn that tariffs on imports are pushing up costs for businesses and could soon result in higher prices for households.The share of Americans expecting a recession within the next year rose in August to the highest level since April, when the tariff measures were first rolled out.","Consumer confidence index slipped to 97.4 in August from 98.7 in July.

Australia’s government-owned postal service had also announced temporarily halting parcel deliveries to the US, citing changes made by Washington to long-standing customs rules.Australia Post said the action was unavoidable after the Trump administration scrapped a regulation that had allowed low-value packages to enter the US duty-free. From 29 August, the US will impose duties on goods valued at $800 or below, suspending the “de minimis” exemption.Under the new rules, parcels sent through the postal system face one of two tariffs: either an ""ad valorem duty"" equal to the effective tariff rate of the package's country of origin, or, for six months, a flat charge of $80 to $200 depending on the country’s tariff rate, Reuters reported.Packages to the US and Puerto Rico lodged on or after 26 August will not be accepted until further notice. Letters, documents, and gifts worth under $100 are exempt.""We are disappointed we have had to take this action, however, due to the complex and rapidly evolving situation, a temporary partial suspension has been necessary to allow us to develop and implement a workable solution for our customers,"" Australia Post said in a statement.Japan Post also announced on Monday that it had suspended some items, though economy minister Ryosei Akazawa insisted the impact would be limited since other shipping options remained available. South Korea has stopped shipping parcels to the US, though customers can still send through its partnership with UPS.FedEx, however, stressed it would continue to operate normally.

ADB to the rescue? Pakistan eyes $2 billion railway upgrade; China’s decade-long rail promise falters,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/adb-to-the-rescue-pakistan-eyes-2-billion-railway-upgrade-chinas-decade-long-rail-promise-falters/articleshow/123522957.cms,"Representative image

The Asian Development Bank is set to finance improvements to Pakistan's railway infrastructure, taking over from China following extended delays in securing Chinese funding that risked affecting a crucial mining venture, according to sources quoted by Reuters.The initial plan for renovating 1,800 km of railways was a key component of China's $60 billion investment initiative in Pakistan, announced in 2015 as part of the Belt and Road Initiative. However, after ten years of discussions, the railway upgrade financing remains unresolved, whilst Pakistan faces challenges in repaying existing Chinese project debts.Sources familiar with the matter told Reuters that the ADB is finalising arrangements to spearhead a $2 billion upgrade of a 500-km railway section from Karachi to Rohri. This development has become crucial for transporting copper ore from the Reko Diq mine, currently under development by Canada's Barrick Mining Corp.""We will have a crisis. How will you evacuate output from Reko Diq? The exhausted line will come under even more pressure,"" stated a senior government official. Pakistan's railways ministry offered no immediate response, while China's foreign ministry affirmed, ""China and Pakistan are iron friends and all-weather strategic partners.""The ADB declined to confirm the financing arrangement but acknowledged ongoing discussions with Pakistan regarding railway sector development. The agreement, anticipated to be announced this month, involves the ADB leading a consortium and selecting an international engineering contractor through competitive bidding.The diplomatic considerations have been addressed with China, according to sources. The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor has seen reduced momentum, with the last significant project completed in 2022. Pakistan faces challenges with payments for Chinese-built power stations and seeks debt restructuring.The Reko Diq copper and gold mine, crucial to Pakistan's mining sector development, aims to commence production in 2028, yielding approximately 200,000 metric tonnes of copper concentrate annually. The ADB-backed railway upgrade will enhance the track system for faster diesel train operations between Karachi and Rohri.The project faces additional challenges, including security concerns in Balochistan province, where militant activities frequently target railway infrastructure. Tim Cribb, Reko Diq's project director, confirmed collaborative efforts between the government and Barrick regarding financing for the western railway branch to Rohri.","The Asian Development Bank is set to finance improvements to Pakistan's railway infrastructure, taking over from China.

'There will be more transactions': More Intel-like deals coming soon? What Donald Trump's aide said,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/there-will-be-more-transactions-more-intel-like-deals-coming-soon-what-donald-trumps-aide-said/articleshow/123507643.cms,"Donald Trump

After its deal with Intel, the US could be paving a new way to build wealth by investing in more private companies.US President Donald Trump’s top economic adviser, Kevin Hassett, said on Monday that more such investments may follow.Hassett, who heads the National Economic Council, told CNBC that Trump’s push for a sovereign wealth fund is part of the plan. “I'm sure that at some point there'll be more transactions” in the semiconductor industry or others, he said.The comments came after Washington agreed to take a 9.9% stake in Intel, valued at $8.9 billion. Under the deal, the US government will receive 433.3 million shares of common stock.The money comes in part from $5.7 billion in grants under the CHIPS and Science Act, a law passed during Joe Biden’s presidency but criticised by Trump, along with funding from another award.Hassett said that the shift marks a new approach.“In the past, the federal government has been giving money away,” he said. By contrast, under the Intel deal, “these are going to be shares that don't have voting rights.” He further added that the government does not intend to interfere in how companies are run.However, Intel flagged potential risks in a securities filing on Monday. The company warned that the government’s equity stake could reduce its chances of winning future grants and that uncertainties remain around the timing and conditions of funding.It also cautioned that its global business might be “adversely impacted” by the US government being a major shareholder.Critics fear that politics could start to drive business decisions, hurting the company’s prospects.The strategy is tied to Trump’s wider vision. In February, soon after returning to the White House, his administration unveiled plans to establish a sovereign wealth fund for the world’s largest economy. Such funds, common in resource-rich nations, use state reserves to secure long-term financial returns.For now, Hassett described the Intel case as exceptional. He said that it came out of “a very, very special circumstance because of the massive amount of CHIPS act spending that was coming Intel's way,” he explained.","US President Donald Trump's top economic adviser, Kevin Hassett, said on Monday that more such investments may follow.

Billionaire Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence startup xAI has filed a lawsuit against Apple and OpenAI in a US federal court in Texas, accusing the two companies of conspiring to stifle competition in the fast-growing AI market, reported Reuters.According to the complaint, Apple and OpenAI have “locked up markets to maintain their monopolies and prevent innovators like X and xAI from competing.”Musk’s company alleges that Apple’s exclusive partnership with OpenAI, integrating ChatGPT into iPhones, iPads, and Macs, has effectively shut out rivals from gaining prominence on the Apple App Store.“If not for its exclusive deal with OpenAI, Apple would have no reason to refrain from more prominently featuring the X app and the Grok app in its App Store,” the lawsuit states.Neither Apple nor OpenAI has responded yet.The legal challenge follows Musk’s public threats earlier this month, when he posted on his social media platform X that Apple’s behavior “makes it impossible for any AI company besides OpenAI to reach #1 in the App Store.”Launched less than two years ago, xAI is positioning itself as a challenger to OpenAI and Microsoft-backed AI initiatives, as well as to Chinese startup DeepSeek.Musk has tied the company closely with his other ventures: xAI acquired X (formerly Twitter) for $33 billion earlier this year to boost chatbot training and has integrated its Grok AI assistant into Tesla vehicles.This is not Musk’s first legal battle with OpenAI. He is separately suing the company and its CEO Sam Altman in California, seeking to challenge its transition from a nonprofit—founded with his backing in 2015—to a for-profit model.Apple’s App Store policies have long drawn scrutiny. In an ongoing case brought by “Fortnite” maker Epic Games, a judge ordered Apple to open its payment system to greater competition, highlighting growing regulatory and legal pressure on the tech giant.","Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence startup xAI has filed a lawsuit against Apple and OpenAI.

But after a meeting, Trump described him as the “Highly Respected Chief Executive Officer” who “negotiated this deal” with him.Tan, in response, thanked the administration for its “confidence” in Intel and reaffirmed the company’s commitment to delivering secure and trusted semiconductors for the US.","Trump also took aim at the ""stupid"" people opposing the deal saying that the deal is worth $11 billion.

NEW DELHI: Food chain McDonalds is reducing the cost of its combo meals in the United States after growing criticism that its menu has become too expensive, according to a report from the Wall Street Journal.The fast-food chain and its franchisees have agreed to lower prices on eight popular combo meals by about 15 percent compared with buying the items separately, sources familiar with the plan told WSJ. McDonald’s will provide financial support to franchisees that participate in the price cuts. The lower rates will take effect from next month.The chain will also expand its value offerings with a $5 breakfast deal and an $8 Big Mac and McNugget combo, reviving its “Extra Value Meals” branding in the coming months. McDonald’s declined to comment on the reports.McDonald’s CEO Chris Kempczinski acknowledged earlier this month that “consumers’ value perceptions are most influenced by our core menu pricing.” He admitted that “value-minded consumers are too often seeing combination meals that cost more than $10 and that is shaping value perceptions in a negative way.” He added: “The single biggest driver of what shapes a consumer’s overall perception of McDonald’s value is the menu board.And it’s when they drive up to the restaurant and they see the menu board, that’s the number one driver. We’ve got to get that fixed.”The pricing move comes amid rising inflationary pressures and changing consumer perceptions. Following the pandemic, McDonald’s was increasingly seen as a pricey alternative rather than a cheap fast-food option, with some customers comparing its rates to sit-down chains like Applebee’s or Chili’s. In 2023, an $18 Big Mac combo at a rest stop went viral, fuelling debate over affordability and prompting the president of McDonald’s USA to clarify that such high prices were “an exception. ”Despite the backlash, promotions such as last year’s $5 meal deal and themed tie-ins, including a “Minecraft Movie” Happy Meal, helped stabilise sales and lift the company out of two straight quarters of declining performance. Reuters reported that McDonald’s beat Wall Street estimates for second-quarter global comparable sales earlier this month, driven in part by affordable bundles.The latest price cuts come as restaurants across the US struggle to retain diners affected by inflation and economic uncertainty. Analysts note that McDonald’s push to restore its affordability image stands in contrast to other large corporations that have raised prices, often citing tariffs and rising costs.While McDonald’s looks to regain its affordability image, other corporations are still raising prices, citing the impact of President Donald Trump’s tariffs. The Wall Street Journal reported that “restaurants, particularly fast-food chains, are struggling to attract customers worn down by inflation and unsure about the US economy.”Sony recently raised the price of its PlayStation 5 console by $50 in the US, while Microsoft and Nintendo also increased prices for their gaming devices and accessories. Home Depot, Procter & Gamble, and Walmart have announced price hikes linked to tariff-related costs, with Walmart’s CFO John David Rainey telling CNBC that “tariff-impacted costs are continuing to drift upwards.”Small businesses, with less flexibility, are also passing costs onto consumers. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warned that “some companies will certainly be taking advantage” of tariffs to raise prices even when not directly affected — similar to how firms hiked costs during the pandemic.Meanwhile, electricity prices are rising at twice the rate of inflation, and housing remains unaffordable for millions. Analysts note that Trump’s repeated promises to bring down prices have not materialised, contributing to his declining approval ratings on economic issues.Washington Post columnist Heather Long described the situation as a “K-shaped economy,” where wealthier households now account for half of all consumer spending. With companies targeting affluent consumers, many businesses are opting to raise prices instead of broadening their customer base.Democrats, sensing voter frustration, have increasingly campaigned on lowering the cost of living. However, economists warn that reversing tariffs alone will not solve inflationary struggles, leaving pressure on policymakers to deliver immediate relief.",Fast-food chain and its franchisees have agreed to lower prices on eight popular combo meals by about 15 percent.

Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume.

Explainer: What is 'Hindu rate of growth' and why Raghuram Rajan's remarks may be 'premature',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/explainer-what-is-hindu-rate-of-growth-and-why-raghuram-rajans-remarks-may-be-premature/articleshow/98482598.cms,"What is meant by Hindu growth rate

How India's GDP has been growing

What SBI report said on savings and investment

Incremental capital output ratio

NEW DELHI: India's gross domestic product (GDP) data for the third quarter (October-December 2022) received a word of caution from the former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan In an interview with news agency PTI, Rajan that India is ""dangerously close"" to the Hindu rate of growth in view of subdued private sector investment, high interest rates and slowing global growth.India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying"".However, a report released by the State Bank of India (SBI) economists on Tuesday dismissed arguments that India is dangerously close to Hindu rate of growth saying such statements are ""ill-conceived, biased and premature"".The term 'Hindu growth rate' was coined by late economist Raj Krishna in 1978 to describe the slow growth in the country.It basically refers to the low pace of economic growth rates during 1950s to 1980s. During this period, the Indian economy averaged 3.5%.A former lecturer at the Delhi School of Economics (DSE), Krishna noted that only if the rate of growth is persistently slow and accompanied by low per-capita GDP, then it will be known as Hindu rate of growth but it has to factor in population growth as well.Before economic reforms of 1991, India's economic growth remained stagnant and low, while per capita income averaged around 1.3%. Krishna termed this low growth situation to be a result of socialist policies of state control and import substitution.However, the economic situation changed when liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation (LPG) reforms came into effect in the year 1991, at a time when India faced balance of payment crisis.Over the years, many economists have strongly opposed the idea of 'Hindu growth rate' and the term never had universal acceptance.The Indian economy plunged into its very first technical recession in FY21 due to the impact of Covid-19 pandemic and the related nationwide lockdowns. GDP shrunk by an unprecedented 23.8% in the first quarter of the financial year 2020-21. However, due to spurt in economic activities in the subsequent quarters, the GDP decline started to narrow.However, if we look at the period before Covid-19 as well, India's growth curve shows a declining trend.From 8.26% in FY17, GDP growth plunged to 3.74% in FY20. Shutdown of economic activities in FY21 in wake of Covid-19 only made matters worse.As lockdowns started to ease and business activities resumed, India's GDP also started rising. In Q1 of FY22, growth jumped to 20.1% mainly on account of low base effect. By the fourth quarter of FY22, growth came down to 4.10%.Similarly, the new financial year 2022-23 brought fresh economic challenges in the form of Russia-Ukraine war that impacted almost all major economies of the world, slowed the pace of growth, pushed inflation to record highs.As a result, the central banks of all advanced economies spurred into action and opted for monetary policy tightening to curb the soaring inflation.With persistently rising interest rates, India's economy grew by 4.4% in Q3 of FY23, as the Centre revised upwards GDP growth for previous year to 9.10% from 8.7% earlier.The report weighed recent GDP numbers against the available data on savings and investments for the past decade and highlighted some interesting points.""Quarterly growth numbers are noisy and should be best avoided for any serious interpretation (on an average, India's GDP growth has witnessed Rs 2 lakh crore upward revision for the 3 year ended FY23),"" the report said.Gross capital formation (GCF) by the government touched a high of 11.8% in 2021-22, up from 10.7% in 2020-21.""This also had a domino effect on private sector investment that jumped from 10 per cent to 10.8% over the same period,"" it said.In fact, Ecowrap added that the trends in GCF to gross output ratio or the plough back of funds for creation of fresh capacity shows that for public administration the ratio attained fresh peak in 2021-22 owing to the emphasis on capital expenditure in recent budgets.At the aggregate level, gross capital formation is supposed to have crossed 32% in 2022-23, the highest level since 2018-19.According to the report, in 2021-22, gross savings have risen to 30% from 29% in 2020-21.""The ratio is supposed to have crossed 31 per cent in 2022-23, the highest since 2018-19. The household savings increased sharply during the pandemic period on account of sharp accretion in financial savings such as deposits,"" said the report by SBI's Economic Research Department.While household financial savings have since then moderated from 15.4% in 2020-21 to 11.1% in 2022-23, savings in physical assets have grown sharply to 11.8% in 2021-22 from 10.7% in 2020-21.The report further analysed Incremental Capital Output ratio (ICOR) -- which measures additional units of capital (investment) needed to produce additional units of output. It said that the ratio has been improving.""ICOR which was 7.5 in FY 12 is now only 3.5 in FY22. Clearly, only half of capital is now needed for next unit of output,"" the report noted.Such reducing ICOR in the current years reflects a relatively increasing efficiency of capital and shows that the economy is on a sound footing, the report said.""From that point of view, future GDP growth rates even at 7% could still mean a decent number by any standards!,"" it added.","India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%. Raghuram Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying""","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-98483158,imgsize-65724,width-400,resizemode-4/98483158.jpg"

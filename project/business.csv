Income Tax Department Crackdown

Income Tax Department’s extensive crackdown! Over the past 20 months, the Income Tax Department has collected Rs 37,000 crore from individuals who had taxable income but failed to file returns, according to officials.Officials analysed data on substantial transactions since 2019-20, including purchases of gems, jewellery, property and luxury holidays paid in cash. ""These are the cases where people were not filing tax returns despite making large purchases. The department had reached out to them over the past 20 months,"" a senior official informed ET.The official noted that an expanded and stricter tax collection and TDS system has helped identify significant transactions that previously went unnoticed.The official indicated that some individuals submitted returns claiming zero income despite substantial expenditure and tax obligations. From the total Rs 37,000 crore recovered, Rs 1,320 crore came from individuals involved in high-value transactions.The department is conducting an extensive initiative to contact taxpayers whose spending patterns do not align with their declared income.Since FY21, it has actively used data analytics and the Non-Filer Monitoring System to identify non-compliant individuals.""Data from multiple sources is being tapped and synchronised... This makes it easy for the department to identify such evasion and nab evaders,"" the official stated.Official data revealed that direct tax collections for April-November increased by 15.4% to Rs 12.10 lakh crore, comprising Rs 5.10 lakh crore in corporate tax and Rs 6.61 lakh crore in non-corporate tax.","Officials analysed data on substantial transactions since 2019-20, including purchases of gems, jewellery, property and luxury holidays paid in cash.

"ITR filing deadline: Don’t miss December 31, 2024 deadline for revised, belated tax returns",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/itr-filing-deadline-dont-miss-december-31-2024-deadline-for-revised-belated-tax-returns-here-are-the-consequences/articleshow/116495382.cms,"If one fails to submit a belated return by December 31, 2024, specific consequences apply.

ITR filing: What are the consequences of missing the belated return filing deadline on December 31, 2024?



ITR filing: What if you miss the revised return filing December 31, 2024 deadline?

ITR filing deadline : December 31, 2024, marks the final deadline for submitting belated and revised income tax returns for FY 2023-24 (AY 2024-25). Whilst various taxpayer categories have distinct ITR filing deadlines, the final date for belated and revised returns remains the same. Many individuals remain unaware of the implications of missing the December 31, 2024, submission deadline for FY 2023-24.If one fails to submit a belated return by December 31, 2024, specific consequences apply.Under Section 139(4) of the Income Tax Act, belated returns incur a Rs 5,000 penalty, regardless of outstanding tax amounts. A reduced penalty of Rs 1,000 applies for lower taxable income. However, individuals with income below the Rs 3 lakh basic exemption limit face no penalties.Kinjal Bhuta, Secretary of Bombay Chartered Accountants' Society, told ET, ""Belated return is the last chance for the taxpayer to file the ITR and claim refunds and certain losses. If the belated return is not filed, the person misses those claims and credits for that assessment year. After the expiry of the filing of the belated return, only an updated return can be filed subject to the condition that there is a tax liability payable. Further, if no belated return is filed, the taxpayer shall have to face increased interests and penalties on the tax liabilities if a notice is sent by the income tax department.""A significant limitation of filing belated returns for FY 2023-24 is the inability to select the old tax regime , as the new regime became default from April 1, 2023. Consequently, belated returns must follow the new tax regime .Also Read | Avoid Rs 10 lakh income tax penalty! Why it's important to report foreign income, assets in ITR by December 31, 2024 - check details The old tax regime offered various deductions and exemptions unavailable in the new tax regime. These provisions helped reduce taxable income and subsequent tax obligations.The new regime permits only two deductions: a standard deduction of Rs 50,000 for FY 2023-24 (AY 2024-25) and employer NPS contributions up to 10% of basic salary. Additional benefits like Section 80C, 80D, and HRA exemptions are not applicable under the new structure.When a taxpayer needs to rectify errors in original or belated returns, they must submit a revised return. This allows corrections of various oversights, such as unreported income, unclaimed deductions, or omitted bank account details.Bhuta says, ""If the taxpayer misses the deadline to file a revised return, there is no other mechanism to file a revised return again for that assessment year and to claim refunds or losses. The income tax laws allow the filing of an updated return. However, the updated return cannot be filed in cases where the taxpayer has losses, it results in an increased refund, or the tax return has an effect of reducing the total tax liability as filed in the original or belated return. There are many other criteria as to when an updated return cannot be filed. So, if a taxpayer misses the revised return deadline, the only way in which any additional claim or credit can be requested is during the assessment proceedings. However, that is subject to litigation.""Also Read | PAN 2.0: How to easily apply for PAN Card reprint with QR code - check 6 simple steps online Whilst taxpayers can submit multiple revised returns, tax experts advise against frequent revisions as this could trigger scrutiny from the Income Tax Department.Regarding intimation notices, Bhuta explains, ""As per section 139(5) of the Income Tax Act, 1961, ITR can be revised only before three months before the end of the relevant assessment year or before the completion of assessment, whichever event happens first. The ITR can be revised even after an intimation has been received under section 143(1). However, once the ITR is processed under a regular scrutiny assessment under section 143(3), the same cannot be revised.""For the financial year 2023-24 (AY 2024-25), taxpayers have until December 31, 2024, to submit their revised returns.","December 31, 2024, marks the final deadline for submitting belated and revised income tax returns for FY 2023-24 (AY 2024-25) If one fails to submit a belated return by December 31, 2016, specific consequences apply. The old tax regime offered various deductions and exemptions unavailable in the new tax regime.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116496929,imgsize-50318,width-400,resizemode-4/116496929.jpg"

Elon Musk-led Tesla has recommenced its search for showroom locations in New Delhi, according to two sources who spoke to Reuters, indicating a potential reconsideration of its Indian market entry after previously suspending investment plans this year.Following a temporary pause in its Indian showroom search, Tesla has now initiated preliminary discussions with DLF regarding space in the capital region, according to two sources with direct knowledge of the developments.According to one source, Tesla seeks 3,000 to 5,000 square feet for a customer experience centre, plus additional space triple that size for service and delivery operations.The company is considering various locations, including DLF's Avenue Mall in southern Delhi and the Cyber Hub complex in Gurugram.Earlier this year, Elon Musk indicated plans to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi and potentially announce a $2-3 billion investment in India.

There is no change in the tax rate of popcorn and the GST Council has only agreed that the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) will issue a circular clarifying the current taxation regime of popcorn.However, opposition politicians, economists and government supporters expressed their disapproval while others responded with humour and satire.""Complexity is a bureaucrat's delight and citizens' nightmare,"" said former Chief Economic Adviser K V Subramanian on X, questioning the decision's value given its minimal revenue impact and public inconvenience.Additionally, his predecessor Arvind Subramanian, criticised the move for increasing complexity rather than simplifying the system, mentioning issues with enforcement and rationality.Meanwhile, Congress party leader and spokesman Jairam Ramesh criticised the ""absurdity of three different tax slabs for popcorn under GST"", saying how it exemplifies the increasing complexity of what was intended to be a straightforward tax system.","GST Council proposed 5% GST for non-branded popcorn with salt and spices, 12% for pre-packaged and branded varieties, and 18% for caramel popcorn, classified under sugar confectionery.

"India's electronics sector eyes major growth, with 12 million jobs projected by 2027",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/indias-electronics-sector-eyes-major-growth-with-12-million-jobs-projected-by-2027/articleshow/116736676.cms,"NEW DELHI: India's electronics industry is on the brink of a transformative phase as it targets USD 500 billion in manufacturing output by 2030, according to TeamLease report .Achieving this goal will require the sector to expand fivefold in the next five years, addressing a USD 400 billion production gap. Presently, the industry's domestic production stands at USD 101 billion, with mobile phones accounting for 43 per cent of this output.Other key contributors include consumer and industrial electronics (12 per cent each), electronic components (11 per cent), and emerging segments such as auto electronics (8 per cent), LED lighting (3 per cent), wearables and hearables (1 per cent), and PCBAs (1 per cent).This extraordinary growth trajectory is projected to generate 12 million jobs by 2027, encompassing 3 million direct and 9 million indirect roles. Direct employment opportunities will span nearly 1 million engineers, 2 million ITI-certified professionals, and 200,000 specialists in high-demand fields such as artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and data science.Meanwhile, non-technical roles will account for the bulk of indirect employment opportunities, reflecting the sector's potential to drive economic growth and create diverse career paths.Despite its promising outlook, the electronics sector faces a significant talent gap that could impede its progress. This challenge is not just about numbers; it involves a critical shortage of skilled professionals essential for achieving the sector's ambitious manufacturing goals. Bridging this gap is crucial to strengthening India's position in the global electronics supply chain.To address this issue, workforce skills must be aligned with industry needs, particularly in high-demand areas such as semiconductors, electromechanical parts, and both passive and active components.The talent pool is expected to come from specialized fields such as Electronics and Electrical streams, ITI-certified professionals, and other technical domains, while general education streams can effectively support indirect roles.AR Ramesh, CEO of TeamLease Degree Apprenticeship, highlighted the need for targeted skilling programs, stating, ""Scaling apprenticeship enrollments, currently growing at a 55 per cent CAGR and projected to reach 1 million apprentices by 2027 to 2 million apprentices, will help create a robust talent pipeline to meet industry needs.""He added, ""To realize its vision of becoming a global leader in electronics manufacturing, India must blend skilling with strategic investments in infrastructure, policy interventions, and innovation to propel the sector forward.""Sumit Kumar, Chief Strategy Officer at TeamLease Degree Apprenticeship, emphasized the importance of capacity building, ""Employers and industries can strengthen this effort by setting up in-house training centres and collaborating with academia through Work-Integrated Learning Programs (WILP) and degree apprenticeships.""He added, ""Scaling apprenticeship programs, reskilling, and upskilling initiatives for over 50 per cent of the workforce, alongside robust capacity-building measures, will empower India to bridge the skills gap and drive sustainable growth, solidifying its position as a global leader in electronics.""To realize its vision of becoming a global leader in electronics manufacturing, India must adopt a multi-pronged approach. This includes investing in skilling programs, fostering industry-academia partnerships, and enhancing infrastructure and policy support.Efforts to increase ITI enrollment, establish in-house training centres, and expand apprenticeship opportunities will be pivotal.Scaling reskilling and upskilling initiatives for over 50 per cent of the workforce, coupled with robust capacity-building measures, can empower the sector to overcome talent shortages and sustain its rapid growth trajectory.","India's electronics industry is on the brink of a transformative phase as it targets USD 500 billion in manufacturing output by 2030.

Consumer discretionary investments followed at $2.30 billion, up 32.2 per cent, while the financial sector experienced a marginal dip to $2.20 billion. Major deals included KiranaKart Technologies (Zepto) at $1.3 billion and Poolside AI SAS at $500 million.Industry leaders are optimistic about sustained growth into 2025, forecasting more initial public offerings (IPOs) and heightened activity in late-stage funding rounds as cautious funds start deploying capital.Experts like Bhaskar Majumdar and Sajith Pai predict a positive shift in the Indian startup ecosystem, anticipating significant easing in 2025.While concerns linger over India's economic dependence on the ""India1"" segment--around 30 million households contributing heavily to GDP--confidence remains bolstered by robust savings and capital inflows.Emerging sectors like electric mobility and green hydrogen offer new opportunities, while traditional industries such as fintech and e-commerce continue to attract interest.Additionally, intellectual property (IP)-driven ventures in deep tech areas, including robotics, drones, and semiconductor technologies, are gaining traction.The evolving global landscape, particularly the impact of the new US administration on international capital flows, is expected to present both challenges and opportunities for Indian startups in the coming year.China's venture capital (VC) funding landscape saw a significant slowdown in 2024, with a total of 2,313 deals announced between January and November, accumulating a disclosed funding value of $32.3 billion, according to GlobalData report.This marks a year-on-year (YoY) decline of 23.1 per cent in deal volume and a 22.5 per cent drop in funding value, as reported by GlobalData, a leading data and analytics company.In comparison, the same period in 2023 recorded 3,006 VC deals, with total disclosed funding of $41.7 billion. The downturn reflects a challenging year for China's VC ecosystem, influenced by regulatory crackdowns, macroeconomic uncertainties, and subdued market conditions.Aurojyoti Bose, Lead Analyst at GlobalData, stated, ""VC funding activity in China has continued to remain subdued in 2024 as investor sentiments seem to have taken a hit on the back of a crackdown on companies, macroeconomic challenges, and uncertain market conditions. However, despite the decline, China remains a key player in the global VC market, second only to the US in deal volume and value.""China accounted for 15.2 per cent of the total number of VC deals announced globally during January-November 2024, with a corresponding funding value share of 13.6 per cent.Noteworthy deals in China during this period included $1.5 billion raised by Changxin Technology, $1.4 billion secured by AVATR, $1.1 billion raised by IM Motors, and $1 billion acquired by Moonshot AI.These substantial deals highlight the country's ongoing significance in the global VC landscape, even amid economic challenges.","Venture capital (VC) activity in India has witnessed significant growth from January to November 2024, with investments reaching $16.77 billion across 888 deals.

In Friday's trades, it briefly touched an intraday low of 85.80 - its sharpest fall in nearly two years, Bloomberg reported.The fall in the rupee was driven by panic dollar buying from importers, increased month-end demand, and maturing non-deliverable forwards (NDFs), which heightened dollar demand in the market. RBI eventually stepped in to stabilise the rupee, selling dollars to counter the rising pressure. However, the broader market environment remained unfavourable, with rising US Treasury yields , higher crude oil prices, and persistent foreign fund outflows capping the rupee's recovery.Dealers said RBI - which held $21 billion in short-term forward contracts - refrained from rolling them over, leading to a scarcity of dollars and an oversupply of rupees. ""The rupee hit the 85.80 level today before RBI stepped in to sell dollars. Interestingly, there was no supply of dollars from RBI for nearly an hour, allowing the rupee to slip significantly - a surprising deviation from its typical approach.

Options expiry

MicroStrategy plan

A Bitcoin rally is fizzling in the final days of a record-breaking year for the digital asset, as investors assess the remaining impetus from President-elect Donald Trump’s embrace of the cryptocurrency sector.The largest token changed hands at $96,200 as of 6 am Friday in London, partly paring a retreat of almost 3 per cent from a day earlier. Smaller rivals including Ether and Dogecoin, a favorite of the meme crowd, oscillated in tight ranges.Trump is pushing ahead with a promise to create a crypto-friendly environment in the US and has backed the idea of establishing a national Bitcoin reserve. Traders are banking some of the profits sparked by the Republican’s crypto cheerleading and are waiting to see if the mooted reserve is feasible.The crypto market is also braced for the expiry of a substantial quantity of Bitcoin and Ether options contracts on Friday — one of the biggest such events in the history of digital assets, according to prime broker FalconX.The notional value of the Bitcoin contracts on the Deribit exchange — one of the largest for digital-asset derivatives — exceeds $14 billion, while the equivalent figure for Ether is about $3.8 billion.Sean McNulty, director of trading at liquidity provider Arbelos Markets, flagged the risk of a “choppy market” amid the expiry of the derivatives positions.Bitcoin is wavering even after MicroStrategy Inc. this week signaled the possibility of expanding its program of purchases of the token. The company has transformed itself from a software maker into a Bitcoin accumulator and now owns more than $40 billion of the digital asset.The original cryptocurrency is flirting with a drop for December, which would be its first monthly decline in four, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

Salesforce Inc says it’s taking multiple large customers from former partner Veeva Systems Inc. in a mounting rivalry to sell software to the pharmaceutical industry.

A Starbucks Corp barista strike has shut down about 170 cafes, according to the coffee chain, disrupting service at locations nationwide during the final days of the crucial holiday shopping season.

A rally in the group that has led Wall Street ’s gains in 2024 lifted stocks in a relatively quiet session ahead of Christmas.Following a strong day for big tech, the shares continued to power ahead on Tuesday. Tesla Inc. led megacaps higher. Broadcom Inc. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. climbed as President Joe Biden’s team launched a probe into Chinese-made chips. In a shortened pre-holiday session, the S&P 500“The action of the past few weeks shows that the big-cap tech names are still the key leadership group in today’s stock market,” said Matt Maley at Miller Tabak. “These big-tech names are highly overweighted in the portfolios of a huge number of institutional investors. Any buying they do over the next week is likely to be concentrated in these names.”Equity investors are also hoping for what’s known as the “Santa Claus Rally,” in which stocks rise during the final five trading sessions of a year and the first two of the new one. This time around that window started Tuesday.“Santa Claus rally could still be alive, with strong seasonality into the end of the year,” said London Stockton at Ned Davis Research.Since 1950, the S&P 500 has generated average and median returns of 1.3% during this period, widely outpacing the market’s average seven-day gain of 0.3%, according to Adam Turnquist at LPL Financial.“When investors are on the ‘nice’ list, and Santa delivers a ‘positive’ Santa Claus Rallyreturn, the S&P 500 has generated an average January and forward annual return of 1.4% and 10.4%, respectively,” he said.The S&P 500 rose 1.1%. The Nasdaq 100 added 1.4%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.9%.The yield on 10-year Treasuries was little changed at 4.59%. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index barely budged.While a positive “Santa Claus Rally” has preceded a 10.4% average annual gain for the S&P 500 since World War II, Sam Stovall at CFRA says a more accurate indicator in his view is the “January Barometer.”That’s a market hypothesis positing that January’s performance predicts the year’s performance. The term was coined by Yale Hirsch, creator of the Stock Trader’s Almanac, in 1972.Since 1945, when the year started with a gain in January, the S&P 500 rose an average of 18.3% in price during the entire year, Stovall at CFRA said. If the first month saw a decline in price, however, the average full-year return was negative 1.9%.With the market up over 25% this year and no corrections of more than 10%, the S&P 500 has managed to stay solidly above its 200-day moving average for the entirety of 2024, noted Bespoke Investment Group strategists.“Barring a significant market selloff in the last few trading days of the year, this will be the 12th year since 1952 (when we went to the current 5-day trading week at the NYSE) that the S&P has traded above its 200-DMA all year,” they said.The average next-year change following these years has been a gain of just 4.6% compared to the average gain of 9.2% for all years, Bespoke noted.Last week, Bank of America Corp. clients were large net buyers of US equities, according to strategist Jill Carey Hall. They bought American shares for the seventh consecutive week.Similar to the prior five weeks, clients bought both single stocks and exchange-traded funds, with bigger inflows into the former, she noted. Flows were primarily in large caps.Investors should have a more-balanced approach in US stocks over the first quarter, according to Citigroup Inc. strategists led by Scott Chronert, who see a greater opportunity in defensive sectors.They raised health care to overweight, noting valuations are now lower and fundamentals seem close to inflection point. Meantime, they are selective on growth stocks, looking for stronger fundamental trend versus valuation and potential margin improvement.Citi’s strategists are overweight in media, internet and semiconductors, while raising software to market weight.",The S&P 500 rose 1.1%. The Nasdaq 100 added 1.4%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.9%. The yield on 10-year Treasuries was little changed at 4.59%.

The battle of the top performing L1 blockchains has been pretty wild this year, with the likes of ETH, SOL, TRX, BNB, Toncoin (TON) and Cardano (ADA) fighting to claim the leadership mantle. However, out of all these networks, TON blockchain is showing huge promise as it records approximately 200% gains.Conversely, Cardano network is also making waves, especially as its new Hydra scalability solution is set to potentially unlock 1 million TPS. On the other hand, predictions about a fast-rising presale star– Lunex Network (LNEX) are blowing up as it shows the potential of overthrowing TON and ADA in 2025.Over the past year and counting, TON blockchain has been widely popular for one major thing— blockchain lucrative games. The partnership between Toncoin and Telegram to bring mini-games to millions of users was a very profitable one.From launching several tap-to-earn games to furthering its expansion in P2E games, Toncoin has been able to rack up approximately 200% NET gains . As experts rank Toncoin (TON) alongside cryptos to buy , analysts are starting to give bullish predictions.Although TON price is currently down by 11% as it trades within a weekly range of $6.6 and $5.9, the network is still receiving positive sentiment. X aanalyst, Crypto King particularly sighted a short term prediction of $10 for Toncoin. While this may seem far-fetched from the current price, the token’s 50, 100, and 200 moving averages points at a strong buy.Since its founder, Charles Hoskinson met up with President Donald Trump for the sake of enhancing crypto adoption, Cardano has been buzzing alongside otherDeFi coins . Cardano price now sits at a weekly range of $$0.98 and $1.28, 70% jump from its price in the past month. However experts believe this is just the starting.During a recent Cardano market dip, whales took the opportunity to accumulate 130 million ADA token, signaling huge bullish sentiment and strong confidence. Owing to this several investors are positive for Cardano network.Ali Martinez, a seasoned crypto analyst and expert has sparked more optimism recently. In a very recent tweet. Ali emphasized on how he will keep buying ADA even if it dips to $0.7 as he expects a further surge to $4 or $6 for Cardano.As a fast, secure and non-custodial DeFi project with robust features to facilitate effortless cross chain transactions, it won’t be surprising for Lunex Network (LNEX) to challenge top DeFi coins. The new altcoin project has already accumulated over $5.4 million in revenue after selling over 2.3 billion of its presale supply. Such buying interest only speaks of its potential to deliver immeasurable returns when it launches on DEX platforms.However, asides the numbers, Lunex Network has more growth potential embedded in its ecosystem and practical use. For starters, the platform allows investors to swap up to 50,000 cryptocurrencies across multi chains by connecting isolated blockchains together. Additionally, users can invest in its LNEX tokens and earn up to 18% APY in passive income when they engage in its staking pool.Furthermore, there’s a reward system where the platform gives half of its revenue to users while preserving the other half for more exclusive rewards. Alongside this, Lunex Network helps investors track their portfolio while delivering updated market insights. The platform also grants cashback rewards on every transaction, allowing users to earn more by actively using the network. With over 300% spike, its LNEX token is now valued at $0.0048 from an initial $0.0012.The practical uses and diversity that Lunex Network brings as an exchange platform is enough to contend with the likes of Toncoin. Although TON has seen huge developments as a mothering network to several other cryptocurrencies, Lunex Network’s intricate design catered for crypto investors, business owners and Web3 development makes it stand out as a tough contender. This put LNEX token on the radar of top cryptos to buy.You can find more information about Lunex Network (LNEX) here:Website: https://lunexnetwork.com Socials: https://linktr.ee/lunexnetwork","Lunex Network (LNEX) is primed for a staggering growth above most DeFi coins.

They plans to finalise a merger agreement by June and complete the transaction, including listing the holding company on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, by August 2026.Japanese automotive manufacturers have fallen behind major competitors in electric vehicle development and are seeking cost reductions while attempting to recover lost ground.Earlier this month, speculation emerged about potential collaboration, with unconfirmed reports suggesting that discussions were partially influenced by Taiwan's Foxconn's interest in acquiring Renault SA's Nissan shares.Meanwhile, Nissan's chief executive Makoto Uchida confirmed no direct communication from Foxconn, while acknowledging Nissan's ""severe"" circumstances.However, even after merger, Toyota will remain Japan's dominant automotive manufacturer, having produced 11.5 million vehicles in 2023. The three combining companies would collectively manufacture approximately 8 million vehicles. During 2023, Honda manufactured 4 million units, Nissan 3.4 million, and Mitsubishi Motors made just over 1 million.Earlier in August, Nissan, Honda and Mitsubishi announced their intention to join hands on electric vehicle components and autonomous driving software research, following an initial agreement between Nissan and Honda in March.Sam Fiorani, vice president of AutoForecast Solutions said that Honda could benefit from Nissan's truck-based SUVs like the Armada and Infiniti QX80, while gaining from Nissan's expertise in battery technology, electric vehicles and hybrid powertrains.Earlier, Nissan announced layoffs affecting 9,000 staff globally in November, alongside a 20% reduction in production capacity, after reporting losses of 9.3 billion yen.

Google proposes fix to solve search monopoly,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/google-proposes-fix-to-solve-search-monopoly/articleshow/116551583.cms,"WASHINGTON: Google said Friday what it thought should change to address a ruling that it had illegally maintained a monopoly over online search: not much.It follows the landmark ruling in Aug by judge Amit P Mehta of the US district court for the district of Columbia, who said Google had illegally maintained a monopoly in online search by paying companies like Apple and Samsung to be the search engine that automatically appears when users open a web browser or a smartphone. The govt then asked the judge to force Google to sell Chrome, the world's most popular browser, among other remedies.In Google's own proposal to fix the search monopoly, it asked Mehta to allow it to continue to pay other companies for its search engine to get prime placement. But it said those agreements should be less restrictive than in the past.Apple, for example, could select different search engines to come up automatically for iPhone and iPad users, said Lee-Anne Mulholland, the company's VP of regulatory affairs, in a blog post.

Britannica didn't just survive. It's an AI company now,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/britannica-didnt-just-survive-its-an-ai-company-now/articleshow/116551465.cms,"For nearly 250 years, the Encyclopaedia Britannica was a bookshelf-busting series of gilt-lettered tomes, often purchased to show that its owners cared about knowledge. It was the sort of physical media expected to die in the internet era, and indeed, the encyclopedia's publisher announced that it was ending the print edition in 2012. Skeptics wondered how Britannica the company could survive in the age of Wikipedia. The answer was to adapt to the times.Britannica Group runs websites, including Britannica.com and the online Merriam-Webster dictionary, and sells educational software to schools and libraries. It also sells artificial intelligence agent software that underpins apps like customer service chatbots and data retrieval.Britannica has figured out not only how to survive, but also how to do well financially. Jorge Cauz, its CEO, said in an interview that the publisher enjoyed pro forma profit margins of about 45%.The company is weighing an initial public offering, in which it could seek a valuation of about $1 billion, according to a person with knowledge of the deliberations.That could provide a sizable return for the company's owner, Swiss financier Jacob E Safra, who acquired the publisher in 1995 and, in a lawsuit filed in 2022, cited an investment bank in valuing Britannica at $500 million. The company says its websites draw over 7 billion annual page views a year, with users in more than 150 countries.Britannica has come far from its origins in the 18th century as the publisher of a reference work put together by three Scottish printers. Over the years, the Encyclopaedia Britannica became a heavyweight of the knowledge business, both literally - the 32-volume 2010 edition, the last to run in print, weighed 129 pounds - and figuratively, drawing on contributions from thousands of experts. It also became an aspirational status symbol, with customers paying nearly $1,400 for that edition.By the time the last Encyclopaedia Britannica was printed, the company had already started its suite of websites and educational software. Now it sees even greater opportunity in the growth of generative AI tools , which the company says can help make learning more dynamic - and therefore more desirable.Cauz said Britannica had experimented with the technology over the past few decades. It acquired Melingo, the company that makes its AI agent software, in 2000 because of its strength in natural language processing and machine learning. And it has two technology teams, based in Chicago and in Tel Aviv.The vertiginous popularity of chatbots like ChatGPT convinced executives that they needed to invest more in the space. Britannica now uses AI in creating, fact-checking and translating content for its products, including the online encyclopedia. It also created a Britannica chatbot that draws on its online encyclopedia's stores of information, which Cauz said was more likely to be accurate than the more generalised chatbots that could be prone to ""hallucinations.""The firm has more projects powered by generative AI in the pipeline: an English-language tutoring software that will use the tech to power avatars and customise lessons for each student, a program to help teachers create lesson plans, and a revamped thesaurus for the Merriam-Webster website that can handle phrases, not just words.","Britannica Group runs websites, including Britannica.com and the online Merriam- Webster dictionary, and sells educational software to schools and libraries.

As such, at just $0.0046, investors have the opportunity to accumulate the token. Given the over $5.3 million raised in the cryptocurrency ICO funding and the 283% ROI for early investors, LNEX might hit $1 on listing in a major exchange.This year's crypto rally has been explosive, with altcoins setting new records.

Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

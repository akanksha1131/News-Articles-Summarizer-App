H-1B visa trouble:

What are NRIs biggest concerns about leaving US?





What is driving this change?



Trump’s recent call sparks sharp divide

A growing number of Indian professionals in the US on H-1B visas are facing an unexpected and alarming threat of deportation landing on their doorsteps before the official 60-day grace period even runs out.Laid off and staring down the barrel of a possible permanent US ban, many say it feels like a ticking time bomb.According to a poll of 1,584 verified professionals conducted on the anonymous workplace app Blind between August 6 and August 8, 2025, one in six (16%) said they or someone they know has received a Notice to Appear (NTA) within the grace period after being laid off.Under normal rules, H-1B workers have 60 days to find a new employer or change visa status after job loss. But since mid-2025, reports have emerged of NTAs being issued within as little as two weeks, labelling recipients “out of status.”“Multiple cases where NTAs were sent in 2 weeks.” a Meta user wrote on Blind.“Immigration lawyers now advise leaving as soon as possible after [the] job ends otherwise you risk a permanent ban from the US,” the user added.This sudden escalation is forcing many to rethink long-term plans.Between July 28 and August 8, 2025, workplace community app Blind surveyed 2,089 verified Indian professionals in the US on work visas such as H-1B and L1, revealing deep concerns about job security and the future of US immigration.In the survey of 2,089 verified Indian professionals, 45% said they would return to India if forced to leave, 26% would move to another country, and 29% were unsure.When asked about their biggest concerns over leaving the US, respondents cited a significant pay cut (25%), lower quality of life (24%), cultural or family adjustment (13%), and fewer job opportunities (10%). Interestingly, 28% said they would have no concerns and would be open to leaving.On whether they would still opt for a US work visa if given the chance again, only 35% said “yes.”While 27% were unsure and 38% said “no,” pointing to a clear shift in how Indian professionals view the long-term value of immigrating to the US.Real experiences are driving this change. More than one in three respondents (35%) said they or someone close to them had been forced to leave the US after losing a job while on a work visa, often under the looming threat of deportation during the brief grace period.The findings suggest a growing openness to leaving the US, with many indicating they would return to India if it came to that.US President Donald Trump’s recent call for US companies to “stop hiring in India” has sparked a sharp divide in opinion.Among US-based professionals, 63% felt the move could benefit their companies, while 69% of India-based respondents believed it would hurt their firms.When asked if they or someone close to them had ever been forced to leave the US after being laid off, 10% said it happened to them directly, 25% said it happened to someone close, and 65% said no.The growing anxieties reflect a broader shift in the perception of the H-1B pathway, once seen as a golden ticket to American opportunities, now increasingly viewed as a high-risk gamble.",A growing number of Indian professionals in the US on H-1B visas are facing an unexpected and alarming threat of deportation. One in six said they or someone they know has received a Notice to Appear (NTA) within the grace period after being laid off.

"Gold price prediction today: Where are gold rates headed on August 12, 2025? Here’s the outlook",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gold-price-prediction-today-where-are-gold-rates-headed-on-august-12-2025-and-in-the-near-term-mcx-gold-outlook/articleshow/123248748.cms,"Gold price prediction: Gold is still caught in its nearly 12-week-old range of $3,250-$3,450. (AI image)

Gold Performance:

Spot gold, in the week ending August 8, closed with a gain of around 1.1% at $3397. On August 11, spot gold prices moved between $3,341 and $3,402 as the metal as gold slipped on a stronger US Dollar amid hopes of US-China truce extension and a breakthrough in the US-Russia talks over Ukraine, which are scheduled to take place in Alaska on August 15.

Lack of clarity on import duty on gold exports to the US also contributed to weakness in gold to some extent.

At the time of writing this article, the shiny metal was changing hands at $3,345, down 1.53% for the day. The MCX October gold contract was noted at Rs 100,318, down nearly 1.50%.

Trades and tariffs:

US President Trump said that trade deal talks with China are progressing nicely.

He urged China to quadruple its soybean orders, saying that it will substantially reduce China’s Trade Deficit with the USA.

US Treasury Secretary Bessent expects trade issues to be finished by October.

Trump confirmed that Nvidia will pay 15% of China chip revenues to the US government.

Data roundup:

China's inflation numbers (July) were out on August 9. CPI y-o-y was steady as against the expectation of a decline of 0.1%, while PPI y-o-y at -3.6% (forecast -3.3%) showed that factory gate deflation extended to the 34th consecutive month.

US Dollar Index and yields:

The US Dollar Index gains could be attributed to the upcoming US CPI (July) to be released today, which is likely to show a pickup in inflation pace. The Dollar Index was noted at 98.58, up 0.42% for the day.

Two-year and Ten-year US yields at 3.74% and 4.26% were down by almost 2 bps each. CPI data would be followed by PPI (July) and retail sales advanced (July) scheduled to be released on August 13 and August 15 respectively.

Gold ETF:

As of August 8, total known global gold ETF holdings surged to a new-cycle high of 92.14MOz -- highest since July 2023.

New exploration remains muted despite high gold prices:

As per a report from S&P Global Commodity Insights, despite gold prices surging to new record highs, exploration activity has remained subdued. In 2024, the gold industry added just 3 deposits to its global database, which raised the reserves from 2.9 billion Ounces to 3 billion Ounces. The industry players are preferring to expand known deposits rather than to bet on new projects. That average size of new deposits has come down from 7.7 million ounces in the previous decades to just 4.4 million ounces since 2020 is also limiting the expansion activities.

Fed watch:

Fed’s Bowman (voter) said that the latest job market data underscores her forecast for three rate cuts this year.

Fed Chair list now also includes former St. Louis Fed President Bullard and former George W. Bush adviser Sumerlin.

Upcoming data:

This week is a data-packed week. Additional major US data on the card this week include industrial production (July), import and export price Indices (July) along with University of Michigan sentiment and inflation expectations (August prel.).

Investors will monitor the Eurozone's 2Q (prel.) employment and the secondary reading of 2Q GDP, too.

Gold Price Outlook:

Gold is still caught in its nearly 12-week-old range of $3,250-$3,450.

In the very near term, US CPI and other inflation data, US-China trade truce extension and US-Russia talks over Ukraine will dictate gold prices.

Chances of a positive outcome out of the US-Russia meeting in Alaska on Friday are slim.

US-China trade truce extension and hot CPI data may pressurize the metal further. In that case, gold may slip further to test support at $3,310 (Rs 99,200). Next major support is at $3,292 (Rs 98,700). Resistance is at $3,375 (Rs 101,200) /$3,410 (Rs 102,300). Gold may stabilize after US-China truce extension and US CPI data as retail sales and the US-Russia talks may not be that positive for risk assets.

Buying property is expensive and often out of reach for most investors, but a real estate investment trust (REIT) offers a way to own a slice of income-generating property without purchasing it outright.A real estate investment trust (REIT) is an investment instrument modelled on mutual funds. Just as a mutual fund company pools investors’ money to create a portfolio of securities, a REIT enables people to invest in income-generating properties that are owned by a trust and managed by a company, according to an ET report .These properties can be residential or commercial, with income generated either through rent or from capital gains on property sales. The proceeds are distributed among investors in the form of dividends, interest, or capital repayment. Investors are issued units — similar to mutual fund units — which can be redeemed as desired. In India, REITs can be listed and traded on stock exchanges and are regulated by the market regulator, Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi).REITs offer a blend of real estate exposure and the accessibility of mutual funds, providing liquidity, diversification, and income potential. However, they also carry exposure to market fluctuations, tax implications, and interest rate changes — factors investors must weigh before investing.","A real estate investment trust (REIT) offers a way to own a slice of income- generating property without purchasing it outright.

US Hits India With Massive 50% Tariff as Donald Trump Retaliates Over Russian Oil Imports

Foreign investment managers display heightened scepticism towards Indian equities, reaching a two-year peak, as the rupee weakens against US tariffs, elevated share valuations and declining corporate profits diminish the appeal of Dalal Street globally.The negative sentiment towards India has led to accelerated foreign withdrawals recently, with their bearish positions in derivatives reaching the highest level since March 2023, further intensified by the 50% tariffs on Indian exports to the US.""Persistent foreign selling, along with short build-up, reflects a clear risk-off approach because of global uncertainties and domestic headwinds,"" said Sudeep Shah, vice-president and head of technical and derivative research, SBI Securities, as quoted by Economic Times.However, for positive observers, the low long-short ratio presents potential opportunity. ""From a contrarian perspective, such an extremely low long-short ratio could also signal that the market is oversold in the short term,"" further said Shah. ""Any positive trigger such as easing global tensions or favourable domestic cues could lead to short covering, resulting in a sharp rebound.""Foreign investors have withdrawn nearly Rs 15,990 crore in August, following a Rs 17,740 crore withdrawal in July.In derivatives, the long-short ratio of foreign positions decreased to 8.28%, from 15% in July's third week and 36.7% at the month's start, according to SBI Securities. The long-short ratio indicates traders' positive versus negative positions in index futures.A declining ratio for FPIs' futures positions indicates increased short positions, according to experts. ""The FPI long-short ratio in index futures is indicating one of the most bearish stances in recent times, with nearly 10 shorts for every long position,"" said Ajit Mishra, senior vice president, research, Religare Broking, quoted by ET. This measure ranged between 10% and 20% in late 2024 and early 2025, during heightened pessimism.The Nifty and Sensex have continued their downward trend for six consecutive weeks, the longest such period in five years. The rupee also declined for five straight weeks, reaching 87.65 against the dollar.International investors, already concerned about Indian stocks' high valuations compared to historical averages and emerging market peers, have shown inconsistent behaviour throughout 2025. The Trump administration's additional 25% tariff on Indian goods, bringing total levies to 50%, amongst the highest globally, appears to be directing them towards alternative markets.""A number of other equity markets at this point offer better risk-reward propositions and more certainty compared to Indian equities,"" said Sham Chandak, head of institutional equities at Elios Financial Services. ""Foreign participants in our market sense that with India ending up on the wrong side of tariffs, private capex and in terms consumption is likely to grow slower than anticipated earlier,"" he added.","Foreign investors have withdrawn nearly Rs 15,990 crore in August, following a Rs 17,740 crore withdrawal in July.

US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Tuesday said India has been headstrong in ongoing trade negotiations with Washington, describing New Delhi as “a bit recalcitrant.”His remarks came days after President Donald Trump announced an additional 25 per cent tariff on Indian imports, citing the country’s Russian oil purchases.Bessent said talks are continuing with some nations, specifically mentioning Switzerland and India, and expressed hope of concluding tariff discussions by October. ""There are big trade deals that aren't done and aren't agreed. Switzerland is still around; India has been a bit recalcitrant.

I think we’re in a good position.""On August 6, Trump authorised an executive order imposing the additional 25 per cent duty, bringing the total tariff on Indian goods to 50 per cent.

It gives both investors exposure to a sector positioned to benefit from global pharmaceutical companies diversifying R&D and manufacturing away from China, particularly in novel drug development.“We are very bullish on the CRDMO space given the strong tailwinds as innovator pharma companies increasingly look to India for drug research and discovery,” Chandra told TOI. He added Aragen’s scale, client base, and dual capability in small molecules and biologics made it a differentiated bet. “We don’t typically compete for deals, we prefer to work synergistically with the ecosystem and take nimble, minority positions three to four years before a potential liquidity event.Founded in 2001 Aragen, formerly GVK Biosciences, works exclusively on innovative pharmaceuticals, from early discovery to commercial manufacturing, and does not operate in generics. “We are one of the few fully integrated players in India that can go from concept to commercial, and among the very few that can do both small molecules and biologics,” Manni Kantipudi, CEO of Aragen Life Sciences, told TOI.The company’s new biologics manufacturing facility in Bengaluru, with an initial 2,000-litre single-use bioreactor capacity (expandable to 23,000 litres), began operations this month. A high potent manufacturing unit in Hyderabad, due in October, will enable production of antibody-drug conjugates, mainly for oncology. “This capability puts us among a select group in India able to make such targeted therapies,” Kantipudi told TOI.About 50% of Aragen’s revenue comes from drug discovery research, 20-25% from early development and the rest from manufacturing. The US accounts for 65% of its business, followed by Europe at 25%. “Of the top 10 selling drugs globally, six are biologics. Small molecules remain a mainstay, but biologics offer higher efficacy, greater barriers to entry, and are a growing share of pharma pipelines,” Kantipudi added.Chandra said FLF III’s average hold period is three to three-and-a-half years, with fund life capped at six years. The Aragen deal follows exits such as selling its stake in Juspay to Kedaara Capital and Lenskart to Fidelity. “Fund sizes and ticket sizes have increased since our first fund in 2019, but the core strategy hasn’t changed,” he said.","Avendus Future Leaders Fund (FLF) III, part of the Avendus Group, and SBI Life Insurance have co-led a Rs 300 crore investment in Hyderabad-headquartered contract research, development and manufacturing organisation (CRDMO) Aragen Life Sciences.

"Log in for luxe buys: Bvlgari to Sabyasachi, labels tap e-tail",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/log-in-for-luxe-buys-bvlgari-to-sabyasachi-labels-tap-e-tail/articleshow/123269624.cms,"ANI image

MUMBAI: When people think about luxury brands, they associate them with huge brick-and-mortar stores. But players in this space are challenging that conventional norm - from global brands Bvlgari, Chanel, and Rado to homegrown luxury label Sabyasachi, companies are expanding online in India.Not all high-end labels are selling their entire portfolio online - couture, for instance, is a category that is very experiential, and the buying experience is best delivered within a physical space, but segments such as bags, jewellery, watches, belts, and beauty products are moving online.India is a big market, and the limited supply of luxury real estate makes it difficult for brands to reach more consumers, while the share of high spenders is growing - thanks to billion-dollar startups minting rich entrepreneurs and family businesses, many of which are regional. There is wealth sitting in smaller cities as well, and besides, disposable incomes are growing. E-commerce platforms such as Tata Cliq, Nykaa, Myntra, Tira, and Ajio have a separate luxe segment.""In India, a lot of people have money; there's a very different demographic, but everybody doesn't look moneyed... the comfort of shopping in your home without judgement or scrutiny is the most important thing,"" Sabyasachi Mukherjee, founder and creative director at Sabyasachi Calcutta, which is launching its digital jewellery boutique on Tata Cliq Luxury later this month, told TOI.Mukherjee said that the brand is looking to tap into a whole set of new consumers through the online launch, a first for the brand's jewellery selection in India.Last year, Italian luxury brand Bvlgari went online in India by setting up a digital boutique on Tata Cliq Luxury.Myntra, which hosts luxury brands such as Giorgio Armani, Jimmy Choo, and Prada (largely perfumes) on its platform, said that the selection on Myntra Luxe has grown by 70% year-on-year in 2024, with the segment witnessing a multi-fold increase in demand.. Reliance Retail has made labels such as Burberry, Versace, and Balenciaga accessible online in India.Bvlgari CEO Jean-Christophe Babin is betting on India to be the next booster market for global luxury growth in the next decade. In an interview with TOI last year, Babin indicated that the brand may look at partnering with more online platforms in India. Gopal Asthana, CEO at Tata CLiQ Luxury, said that Bvlgari, which gets about 40% of its sales from non-metros, has further expanded its assortment in watches, jewellery, and accessories on the platform. “In all, we get about 55% of our sales from non-metros,” said Asthana.For Titan’s Helios, nearly 80% of customer journeys now begin online. While direct online sales currently contribute around 15–20% of its total revenue, the influence of digital touchpoints has grown considerably. “Compared to two years ago, when online interactions played a smaller role in discovery and decision-making, today’s consumers often start their engagement by browsing our website, exploring collections, and learning brand stories before visiting a store. This shift underscores the importance of integrating our online and offline experiences seamlessly,” said Rahul Shukla, Vice President and Chief Sales and Marketing Officer, Watches and Wearables Division at Titan Company.Trends tracked by Myntra showed that non-metros such as Jaipur, Guwahati, and Indore are big spenders on luxury on the platform. “Key categories like Indian luxury, especially wedding collections, along with accessories like watches, bags, and premium beauty, are leading this shift,” a company spokesperson said.Swiss brand Rado and others such as Chanel Beauty and Fragrance have moved and expanded online. Sabyasachi will extend the partnership with Tata CLiQ Luxury beyond jewellery. “Accessories probably will be the next logical step to do. At some point in time, we are going to bring in perfumes and beauty as well,” Mukherjee said. “I have always built a business with the spirit of democracy. Being on an e-commerce portal allows you that democracy,” Mukherjee added.","Luxury brands such as Bvlgari, Chanel, and Rado are expanding online in India.

"Markets watch: Japan's Nikkei 225 reaches record high, Asian stocks rise; crude gains as US-China tariff truce lifts sentiment",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/markets-watch-asian-stocks-rise-crude-gains-as-us-china-tariff-truce-lifts-sentiment/articleshow/123248952.cms,"Representative image

Asian stocks mostly gained on Tuesday, with Japan’s Nikkei 225 (.N225) hitting a fresh all-time record high after US President Donald Trump extended a tariff truce with China for another 90 days, a move that eased trade tensions between the world’s two largest economies and steadied oil prices.The Nikkei jumped as much as 2.8 per cent, or 1,162.86 points, to 42,983.34 in the afternoon before easing back slightly, surpassing its previous record of 42,426.77 set in July last year. Heavyweight shares led the charge — SoftBank Group surged 7.07 per cent, Advantest climbed 7.34 per cent, Toyota gained 3.14 per cent, and Fast Retailing advanced 4.67 per cent. Analysts at IwaiCosmo Securities cited easing tensions over US-China trade talks and speculation over imminent US interest rate cuts as key drivers of the rally.The extension, announced Monday, staves off triple-digit duties on Chinese goods and removes one immediate risk for global markets. Trump signed an executive order delaying the planned tariff hike to allow more time for negotiations, with Beijing issuing a similar statement. Without the extension, tariffs on Chinese imports could have risen from an already steep 30 per cent.According to news agency Reuters, the truce had been largely expected by investors, who have also been buoyed in recent weeks by resilient US corporate earnings and prospects of interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve.Japan’s Nikkei was last up around 2 per cent as markets reopened after a long weekend, lifted by tech shares and tracking global gains.Australia’s benchmark index (.AXJO) also hit a record high ahead of a central bank policy meeting widely expected to deliver a 25-basis-point rate cut, with another possible by November.MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (.MIAPJ0000PUS) was slightly higher, while China’s blue-chip CSI300 (.CSI300) was flat and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng (.HSI) dipped 0.1 per cent in early trade.“The US-China tariff truce extension preserves the status quo for now, so no immediate implications for investment markets,” Shane Oliver, chief economist and head of investment strategy at AMP in Sydney, was quoted as saying by Reuters.Oil prices also edged up as the trade extension eased concerns that escalating tariffs would weaken global economic growth and crimp fuel demand. Brent crude futures rose 26 cents, or 0.39 per cent, to $66.89 a barrel, while US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) gained 22 cents, or 0.34 per cent, to $64.18, according to Reuters.Investors are also watching the August 15 meeting between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska, aimed at negotiating an end to the war in Ukraine. “Any peace deal between Russia and Ukraine would end the risk of disruption to Russian oil that has been hovering over the market,” ANZ senior commodity strategist Daniel Hynes wrote in a note, cited by Reuters.Attention in financial markets will now shift to US consumer price inflation data due later Tuesday. Economists polled by Reuters expect July’s core CPI to rise 0.3 per cent month-on-month, faster than June’s 0.2 per cent pace. “CPI will be a key test for market tone. Softer data could give small-caps a lift, but for now, mega-caps remain firmly in control,” said Marc Velan, head of investments at Lucerne Investment Management.Money markets, according to Bloomberg, are pricing in more than two Fed rate cuts by December, with about a 90 per cent probability of a quarter-point reduction next month.However, an upside surprise in inflation could temper those expectations.","Japan’s Nikkei 225 (.N225) hit a fresh all-time record high after US President Donald Trump extended a tariff truce with China for another 90 days.

India Should Put Out That It Wont Be Intimidated by Trump's 50% Tariff, Says South Asia Expert

Why SBI has stopped Nayara transactions

Russia-backed Indian refinery Nayara Energy is faced with a fresh challenge. India’s largest public sector lender SBI has stopped processing international trade and forex transactions for Nayara Energy following recent US tariff hikes. The bank's decision aims to avoid potential sanctions from the US and European Union, a source told ET. US President Donald Trump has announced a 25% additional tariff on India for its crude oil trade with Russia.Nayara Energy was formed after the Rosneft-led purchase of Essar Oil's Vadinar refinery (20 mtpa) in August 2017. The organisation sources crude oil internationally and holds approximately 8% of India's refining capacity, which exceeds 256 MMTPA, ranking second in Asia.The company maintains a nationwide network of more than 6,500 fuel retail outlets.Also Read | Symbol of India-Russia ties takes a hard hit! How Russia-backed Indian refinery Nayara Energy is navigating a perfect storm - big hurdles challenge growth Nayara Energy has been facing challenges since July, when the European Union enacted its 18th sanctions package which limited fuel imports from Russia and established a $47.6 per barrel ceiling on Russian crude prices.""These European sanctions imposed on July 18 were the last straw. All banks with international branches and operations have to adhere to the government laws to ensure that they do not attract regulatory scrutiny,"" said the person cited above.""The last European sanctions along with the US tariffs imposed after that have made the processing of transactions for Nayara difficult.""""This call has been taken by the bank very recently after the US sanctions to ensure compliance with international rules,"" said the person cited above.

This approach mirrors the arrangement UCO Bank previously employed for processing Iranian crude oil transactions.Experts suggest that UCO Bank's minimal global footprint enables it to operate without significant concern about sanctions.",India's largest public sector lender SBI has stopped processing international trade and forex transactions for Nayara Energy.

US tariffs impact: Lenders weigh MSME relief; government drafts wider export support,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/us-tariffs-impact-lenders-weigh-msme-relief-government-drafts-wider-export-support/articleshow/123251755.cms,"AI image

Lenders are exploring ways to ease the financial pressure on small and medium enterprises (SMEs) hit hardest by the United States’ 50% duty on imports from India.According to ET, lenders are considering scrapping certain administrative charges such as processing fees, foreign exchange hedging costs and collection charges after being nudged by the government.A government official cited by ET said that industry groups and export-oriented MSMEs had raised concerns, which were passed on to banks. “Banks have said they will provide options through these immediate relief measures,” the official said.While broad cuts in interest rates are unlikely without a government-backed subvention scheme, bankers indicated they may stop charging penal interest for missed repayment deadlines to prevent accounts from turning into bad assets.“Unless there is some sort of relief package announced, banks have limited scope to drastically bring down rates or offer systemic support,” an executive director of a state-run bank was quoted as saying by ET.The government, meanwhile, is working on a broader support plan under its proposed Export Promotion Mission. Measures being considered include customised schemes for affected sectors, redirecting exports to alternative markets, and pushing products with weak export demand into the domestic market.Exporters are also being urged to build strong Indian brands to withstand the tariff shock.Industry representatives have asked that penal interest on loans be applied only once accounts become non-performing, and that collateral requirements be aligned with the level of risk.One industry official noted that banks often refuse textile machinery as collateral, hampering loan access for textile exporters. Discussions are also underway on sector-specific credit lines with relaxed collateral rules and cheaper export factoring services.Currently, factoring services in Singapore are 10–11% cheaper than those in India, prompting many exporters to use them. MSMEs, which contribute heavily to India’s exports and employ millions, are seen as the most vulnerable to the tariff impact, particularly in sectors such as textiles.Another banker cited by ET said that they are advising clients to use the Credit Guarantee Fund Trust for Micro and Small Enterprises (CGTSME), which covers loans of up to Rs 10 crore per borrower. “We are actively pursuing this and, in some cases, handholding firms to get the Udyam registration to be eligible under the guarantee scheme,” the banker said.","Lenders are exploring ways to ease the financial pressure on small and medium enterprises (SMEs) hit hardest by the United States’ 50% duty on imports from India.

Donald Trump tariffs: Indian electronics pivot as levies push diversification; new markets eyed,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/donald-trump-tariffs-indian-electronics-pivot-as-levies-push-diversification-new-markets-eyed/articleshow/123251478.cms,"AI image

With the US set to impose steep new tariffs that industry executives say resemble the protectionist levies of the Great Depression era, Indian electronics exporters are scouting alternative markets in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.The move comes as the US, still the largest buyer of India’s electronics goods, becomes a tougher market, weighed down by tariff hikes and shifting content-origin rules. “I have been reaching out to my customers proactively. They are still issuing orders, but there are concerns about how this will pan out,” Sanjay Agarwal, managing director of Globe Capacitors, which exports about Rs 100 crore worth of materials annually to the US, was quoted as saying by ET.“I have already controlled my purchases, especially for the materials I buy only for US customers. As far as looking at alternative markets is considered, that is always on the horizon”, he added.While most electronics exports, including smartphones, currently remain exempt from both the 25% tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump and the additional 25% set to take effect from August 26, these exemptions are under review.They hinge on a US commerce department section 232 investigation mandated under the Trade Expansion Act, 1962, with findings expected in the coming weeks, according to ET.Rajoo Goel, secretary general of the Electronic Industries Association of India (ELCINA), said about 75–80% of India’s electronics exports are shielded from the new 50% tariff regime, but the remainder, including PCB assemblies, telecom gear, consumer products and power electronics, will feel the pinch. “For these products, our value addition is higher and would impact several domestic companies, including MSMEs,” Goel said, as per ET.US-bound electronics exports from India jumped 43.5% to $15.89 billion in FY25. Smartphones led the surge, accounting for $10.56 billion, up 89% from the previous year and made up 66% of all electronics exports to the US. “We are monitoring the situation closely and are looking at other markets for our products. For mobile phones, the Middle East and Africa are coming up as important destinations and for lighting, Europe is a market we are evaluating,” said an executive at an electronic manufacturing services (EMS) firm.Assembled photovoltaic cells (PVC) modules, the second-largest category, fell 32.7% to $1.81 billion in FY25 due to tighter curbs on imported units. Other exports included electronic instruments ($1.4 billion), computer hardware such as laptops ($154 million), and consumer electronics like cameras ($115 million).For the roughly $2 billion worth of electronics exports to the US beyond smartphones and PVC modules, there are ample alternative markets, according to Amrit Manwani, chairman of EMS major Sahasra Group. “Exporters should explore Europe, Australia, South East Asia, and given the geopolitical realignment, even Russia.Many firms may have to adapt and establish partial or full manufacturing in the US given its predominance as a market, if things don’t ease,” Manwani said. Another EMS executive was quoted as saying by ET that companies need to focus on “demand resilience” in addition to supply chain resilience.“Companies will have to look at other markets like the Middle East, Europe, Latin America and Africa. It is an opportunity for Indian companies to go beyond the US and deepen their presence in other countries as well,” the executive said.","US-bound electronics exports from India jumped 43.5% to $15.89 billion in FY25.

(Picture credit: AP)

Ford Motor Company is set to spend nearly $2 billion converting its Louisville Assembly Plant in Kentucky into an electric vehicle (EV) production hub, marking a major shift after seven decades of making petrol-powered models there.Speaking to workers on Monday, CEO Jim Farley called the project a once-in-a-career moment. “In our careers, as automobile people, we’re lucky if we get to work on one, maybe two, projects that really change the face of our industry. And I believe today is going to light the match as one of those projects for all of us here,” he said, according to news agency AP.The revamped plant will first roll out a midsize, four-door electric pickup truck in 2027 for both US and global markets. Ford says the model will seat five adults, accelerate from 0–60 mph as quickly as a Mustang EcoBoost, and use lower-cost batteries made at a $3 billion Michigan factory.Farley described it as a “Model T moment” for Ford’s EVs, signalling the most radical manufacturing change since Henry Ford’s original assembly line.The Louisville site will adopt a new “assembly tree” layout, with three subassembly lines feeding into the final build.Ford says this will cut parts by 20%, use 25% fewer fasteners, reduce workstations by 40%, and speed up assembly by 15%.Ford aims to produce EVs that are both affordable, with a targeted starting price of about $30,000 and profitable. As per the company, this plant will help in securing 2,200 hourly jobs.Governor Andy Beshear hailed the move and said, “This announcement not only represents one of the largest investments on record in our state, it also boosts Kentucky’s position at the centre of EV-related innovation and solidifies Louisville Assembly Plant as an important part of Ford’s future”.Combined with the Michigan battery plant, Ford’s $5 billion investment is expected to secure or create nearly 4,000 jobs.Farley was quoted by AP as saying that the company chose to build in Kentucky rather than overseas to “take the fight to our competition,” including Chinese manufacturers. “We’re not in a race to build the most electric cars. We’re in a race to have a sustainable electric business that’s profitable, that customers love,” he said, adding that the new truck would outclass anything available from China.However, he acknowledged risks. “There are no guarantees… The automotive industry has a graveyard littered with affordable vehicles launched in our country with all good intentions… And at Ford, we set out to break that cycle.”","Ford Motor Company is set to spend nearly $2 billion converting its Louisville Assembly Plant in Kentucky into an electric vehicle (EV) production hub.

Trade war: Will US impose tariffs on gold?

US President Donald Trump said on Monday that gold imports will not face tariffs, ending days of uncertainty that had rattled global bullion markets and sent futures prices to record highs.""Gold will not be Tariffed!"" Trump said in a statement on his Truth Social account, without providing further details. His remarks followed confusion triggered by a US Customs and Border Protection letter that appeared to classify two standard gold bar weights — one kilogram and 100 ounces (2.8 kilos) — as subject to duties.According to Reuters, the ruling posted on the customs website last week had raised concerns that Washington might place the most widely traded bullion bars in the United States under country-specific import tariffs, potentially disrupting global supply chains. A White House official told Reuters on Friday that the administration was preparing an executive order “clarifying misinformation” about tariffs on gold bars and other specialty products.The customs letter, dated July 31 and first reported by the Financial Times, had spurred a surge in gold prices, with December delivery contracts hitting a record high on the Comex, the world’s largest futures market. One-kilo bars comprise the bulk of Switzerland’s bullion exports to the United States, and a 39 percent levy under Trump’s “reciprocal” tariffs had been seen as a major risk for the European nation, a key refining and transit hub.""Delighted to hear the crisis has been averted,"" independent gold market analyst Ross Norman told Reuters. ""It will come as an enormous relief to the bullion markets, as the potential for disruption was incalculable.""Following Trump’s post, US gold futures fell 2.4 percent to $3,407 per ounce, narrowing the premium over spot gold, which dropped 1.2 percent to $3,357. Shares of Barrick Mining fell 2.8 percent after posting quarterly results, while Newmont, the world’s largest gold miner, slipped slightly to $68.87.Gold, considered a safe-haven asset, has already touched record highs this year amid tariff tensions and geopolitical unrest.(With inputs from Reuters)",US President Donald Trump said on Monday that gold imports will not face tariffs.

Norway’s sovereign wealth fund — the world’s largest — has announced the sale of its holdings in 11 Israeli companies, citing the worsening humanitarian crisis in Gaza and the broader conflict in the region.Nicolai Tangen, chief of Norges Bank Investment Management (NBIM), which manages the fund, said the decision was taken “in response to extraordinary circumstances”, AFP reported.“The situation in Gaza is a serious humanitarian crisis. We are invested in companies that operate in a country at war, and conditions in the West Bank and Gaza have recently worsened,” Tangen said in a statement.Known as the oil fund due to its revenue source from Norway’s vast energy exports, the sovereign fund is valued at around $1.9 trillion and has investments spread across the globe.The move comes days after Norwegian dailyreported that the fund had invested in Israeli Bet Shemesh Engines Holdings, a manufacturer of parts for engines used in Israeli fighter jets. Tangen later confirmed the reports, noting that the stake in the company had even increased after the Gaza offensive began.Following the revelations, Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store asked Finance Minister and former Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg to review the matter.NBIM disclosed that at the end of the first half of 2025, it held investments in 61 Israeli companies, of which 11 were not part of its “equity benchmark index” — a reference portfolio set by Norway’s finance ministry to measure the fund’s performance.The wealth fund said it decided last week to sell all such off-benchmark holdings in Israeli firms “as soon as possible”.It also stressed that it has “long paid particular attention to companies associated with war and conflict”, noting that since 2020 it has engaged with over 60 companies on such issues, including 39 linked to the West Bank and Gaza.Monitoring of Israeli firms was stepped up in autumn 2024, NBIM said, and has already led to divestments from several companies.",Norway's sovereign wealth fund has announced the sale of its holdings in 11 Israeli companies.

Property crisis continues! China South City ordered to liquidate by Hong Kong court; biggest since Evergrande,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/property-crisis-continues-china-south-city-ordered-to-liquidate-by-hong-kong-court-biggest-since-evergrande/articleshow/123241088.cms,"The execution of China South City's liquidation may encounter difficulties regarding mainland asset seizure.

A Hong Kong High Court has issued a liquidation order for China South City Holdings Ltd., marking the largest Chinese construction company by assets to face winding up since China Evergrande Group.This court decision exemplifies the ongoing impact of China's property sector crisis on major real estate firms. Despite governmental support measures, residential sales remain subdued, suggesting a delayed recovery. UBS Group AG has revised its earlier optimistic outlook, now anticipating a postponed revival unless Beijing implements additional economic support.Judge Linda Chan delivered the verdict after the petitioner requested immediate liquidation proceedings. Despite China South City's plea for an additional opportunity, the judge noted the absence of meaningful advancement in their restructuring plans, according to a Bloomberg report.Since 2021, Hong Kong courts have issued no fewer than six liquidation orders for Chinese property developers, including Evergrande, whose complex case involved substantial assets and numerous stakeholders.The execution of China South City's liquidation may encounter difficulties regarding mainland asset seizure.Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Andrew Chan noted, ""There might not be many offshore assets to liquidate,"" explaining that the company's primary subsidiaries are based in mainland China.The firm's legal representative disclosed offshore debt totalling $1.3 billion, with principal bondholders controlling over 31% of this amount, according to the company's lawyer on Monday.China South City faced disagreements with creditors on multiple fronts. At a May hearing, creditors expressed their desire for increased involvement from the company's largest shareholder, Shenzhen SEZ Construction and Development Group Co., in debt negotiations.Shenzhen SEZ provides keepwell deeds for certain dollar bonds of the builder. These agreements ensure the issuer's solvency without explicitly guaranteeing payment, typically helping to reduce investor concerns about risk.Despite defaulting on dollar notes over a year ago, China South City's bonds were trading at approximately 25 cents as of Monday morning, according to Bloomberg-compiled data.This contrasts with Evergrande's bonds, which traded just above 1 cent before its January 2024 liquidation. China South City's bond prices exceed those of other defaulted developers, including Country Garden Holdings Co. and Sunac China Holdings Ltd., which has completed its second restructuring round.According to Zerlina Zeng, head of Asian strategy at Creditsights Singapore, the liquidation could be prolonged due to the company's substantial size. ""We expect poor recovery on its dollar bonds given limited additional financial support from the largest SOE stakeholder, Shenzhen SEZ Construction,"" she noted.The company shares a similar ownership structure with China Vanke Co., a significant Chinese developer that received state support in January from local authorities in Shenzhen.As of December 31, 2024, China South City reported total liabilities of approximately HK$60.9 billion, with cash and bank balances at HK$717.7 million.Citicorp International Ltd., the trustee of the developer's dollar bonds, initiated the winding-up petition against China South City. Citicorp also filed a separate legal action against Shenzhen SEZ last year.Trading of China South City's shares was suspended in Hong Kong on Monday.","Hong Kong High Court has issued a liquidation order for China South City Holdings Ltd.

Ford EV shift: Automaker to invest nearly $2 billion in Kentucky plant; plans affordable midsize electric pickup by 2027,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/ford-ev-shift-automaker-to-invest-nearly-2-billion-in-kentucky-plant-plans-affordable-midsize-electric-pickup-by-2027/articleshow/123239673.cms,"Photo credit- AP

Ford Motor Co. will invest nearly $2 billion to retool its Louisville Assembly Plant in Kentucky for electric vehicle (EV) production, aiming to build affordable and profitable models that can compete globally. The move marks a major transition for the facility, which has produced gas-powered vehicles for 70 years.“We took a radical approach to solve a very hard challenge: Create affordable vehicles that are breakthrough in every way that matters — design, technology, performance, space and cost of ownership — and do it with American workers,” Ford CEO Jim Farley said in a release, reported AP.The announcement comes even as President Donald Trump’s administration rolls back EV purchase incentives, including plans to eliminate a federal credit worth up to $7,500. Farley, however, stressed that electric vehicles remain central to Ford’s future strategy.The first EV from the revamped Louisville plant will be a midsize, four-door electric pickup truck for domestic and international markets, set to launch in 2027. It will use lower-cost batteries manufactured at a Ford plant in Michigan, part of a previously announced $3 billion investment.Ford described the programme as a “Model T moment” for its EV division, referencing the mass-market vehicle that transformed the company’s history.The new platform will support multiple models, from sedans to SUVs, and combine electric and internal combustion variants.The Louisville plant will adopt an “assembly tree” system instead of a traditional single-line conveyor, cutting production costs and improving efficiency. Ford expects the new platform to reduce parts by 20%, cut fasteners by 25%, lower the number of workstations by 40% and shorten assembly time by 15%.“This is an example of us rejuvenating our US plants with the most modern manufacturing techniques,” Farley told the Associated Press. The midsize truck is expected to start at around $30,000, though specifications such as range, battery size and charge times will be announced later.The $2 billion investment will secure 2,200 hourly jobs in Louisville. Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear called it “one of the largest investments on record in our state,” boosting Kentucky’s standing in EV innovation.Combined with the Michigan battery plant, Ford’s total $5 billion investment is projected to create or secure nearly 4,000 direct jobs and expand the domestic EV supply chain through dozens of new US-based suppliers.Ford’s EV unit, Model e, reported a $5.08 billion loss in 2024 with revenue down 35% to $3.9 billion. Farley emphasised that the goal is not to produce the most EVs, but to build a sustainable and profitable EV business that customers value.“This new vehicle built in Louisville, Kentucky, is going to be a much better solution to anything that anyone can buy from China,” he added.","Ford Motor Co. will invest nearly $2 billion to retool its Louisville Assembly Plant in Kentucky for electric vehicle (EV) production.

Inflation, while well below the peak of over 9% three years ago, remains above the US Federal Reserve’s 2% target. President Donald Trump’s tariff policies have added to concerns that price pressures could intensify.The risk, analysts warn, is of “stagflation” — where inflation stays high while economic growth slows. Fed Governor Michelle Bowman said on Saturday she sees the job market as the bigger worry and supports three interest rate cuts this year, citing a weaker-than-expected July jobs report. Trump has also publicly pressed the Fed to cut rates.However, Fed Chair Jerome Powell and other policymakers remain cautious, preferring to wait for more data on tariff impacts before deciding. Tuesday’s CPI reading could influence the central bank’s next move.Strategists at Stifel, led by Thomas Carroll and Barry Bannister, cautioned that consumer spending is already slowing, potentially dragging the US economy close to a standstill in the second half of 2025. “Rate cuts cannot save an overvalued S&P 500,” they warned, suggesting that only stronger corporate earnings can support current market valuations.Among movers, Micron Technology surged 4.8% after raising quarterly profit and revenue guidance, citing higher memory chip prices.

'Trump yet to decide on tariffs over China’s Russian oil purchase': Vance

President Donald Trump on Monday called on China to increase its purchases of American soybeans, framing the move as a way to address Beijing’s trade deficit with the United States.In a post on Truth Social, Trump wrote, “China is worried about its shortage of soybeans. Our great farmers produce the most robust soybeans. I hope China will quickly quadruple its soybean orders. This is also a way of substantially reducing China’s Trade Deficit with the USA. Rapid service will be provided. Thank you President XI.”This comes as US-China tensions loom as the tariff truce between the two nations ends Tuesday, raising the risk of renewed higher tariffs.Trump has not yet decided whether to impose tariffs on China over its purchases of Russian oil, according to Vice President J D Vance who cited broader complexities in Washington’s relationship with Beijing.“The President said he’s thinking about it, but he hasn’t made any firm decisions,” Vance told Fox News Sunday.He was responding to a question on whether China could face similar measures to those reportedly under consideration for countries like India, which also import Russian oil.“Obviously, the China issue is a little bit more complicated because our relationship with China affects a lot of other things that have nothing to do with the Russian situation,” Vance said.","President Donald Trump called on China to increase its purchases of American soybeans, framing the move as a way to address Beijing's trade deficit with the United States.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume.

Stay informed with the latest business news, updates on bank holidays and public holidays.





Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.","Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain.

The Series A funding round was led by Lightspeed Venture Partners , and participants included Silicon Valley billionaire Vinod Khosla’s Khosla Ventures and Peak XV Partners , formerly Sequoia Capital India & Southeast Asia, Sarvam said Thursday.The Bangalore-based startup, until recently in stealth mode, was co-founded by Vivek Raghavan and Pratyush Kumar. It has ambitious plans to build open source foundational AI systems as well as tools for creating apps for the meager compute infrastructure available to developers in India. The startup has a total of 18 employees and is just opening an office in the city.""What we are showing is that you can build large language models with limited resources,” Raghavan said in a phone interview. ""We are building at a smaller scale and demonstrating that these can be extremely cost and energy efficient so they can be accessed by everyone.""Large language models, like OpenAI’s GPT-4 and Meta Platforms Inc.’s Llama, are powerful AI systems that understand by learning from vast amounts of diverse data from the internet and elsewhere to summarize, translate, and create text, audio and video for a wide range of applications.

Startups will play important role in helping India become 3rd largest economy: CEA Nageswaran,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/startups-will-play-important-role-in-helping-india-become-3rd-largest-economy-cea-nageswaran/articleshow/105332523.cms,"Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor ( CEA ) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran Udaan until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.Udaan built an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business still accounts for a very small part of India’s overall retail market but can balloon to $150 billion in sales and yield a 100% return on capital invested in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co. estimates published in the Mint newspaper.Bengaluru-based Udaan has also ventured into financing through its fintech unit which helps shopkeepers get working capital loans to buy inventory. That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says.

How India's GDP has been growing

What SBI report said on savings and investment

Incremental capital output ratio

NEW DELHI: India's gross domestic product (GDP) data for the third quarter (October-December 2022) received a word of caution from the former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan In an interview with news agency PTI, Rajan that India is ""dangerously close"" to the Hindu rate of growth in view of subdued private sector investment, high interest rates and slowing global growth.India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying"".However, a report released by the State Bank of India (SBI) economists on Tuesday dismissed arguments that India is dangerously close to Hindu rate of growth saying such statements are ""ill-conceived, biased and premature"".The term 'Hindu growth rate' was coined by late economist Raj Krishna in 1978 to describe the slow growth in the country.It basically refers to the low pace of economic growth rates during 1950s to 1980s. During this period, the Indian economy averaged 3.5%.A former lecturer at the Delhi School of Economics (DSE), Krishna noted that only if the rate of growth is persistently slow and accompanied by low per-capita GDP, then it will be known as Hindu rate of growth but it has to factor in population growth as well.Before economic reforms of 1991, India's economic growth remained stagnant and low, while per capita income averaged around 1.3%. Krishna termed this low growth situation to be a result of socialist policies of state control and import substitution.However, the economic situation changed when liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation (LPG) reforms came into effect in the year 1991, at a time when India faced balance of payment crisis.Over the years, many economists have strongly opposed the idea of 'Hindu growth rate' and the term never had universal acceptance.The Indian economy plunged into its very first technical recession in FY21 due to the impact of Covid-19 pandemic and the related nationwide lockdowns. GDP shrunk by an unprecedented 23.8% in the first quarter of the financial year 2020-21. However, due to spurt in economic activities in the subsequent quarters, the GDP decline started to narrow.However, if we look at the period before Covid-19 as well, India's growth curve shows a declining trend.From 8.26% in FY17, GDP growth plunged to 3.74% in FY20. Shutdown of economic activities in FY21 in wake of Covid-19 only made matters worse.As lockdowns started to ease and business activities resumed, India's GDP also started rising. In Q1 of FY22, growth jumped to 20.1% mainly on account of low base effect. By the fourth quarter of FY22, growth came down to 4.10%.Similarly, the new financial year 2022-23 brought fresh economic challenges in the form of Russia-Ukraine war that impacted almost all major economies of the world, slowed the pace of growth, pushed inflation to record highs.As a result, the central banks of all advanced economies spurred into action and opted for monetary policy tightening to curb the soaring inflation.With persistently rising interest rates, India's economy grew by 4.4% in Q3 of FY23, as the Centre revised upwards GDP growth for previous year to 9.10% from 8.7% earlier.The report weighed recent GDP numbers against the available data on savings and investments for the past decade and highlighted some interesting points.""Quarterly growth numbers are noisy and should be best avoided for any serious interpretation (on an average, India's GDP growth has witnessed Rs 2 lakh crore upward revision for the 3 year ended FY23),"" the report said.Gross capital formation (GCF) by the government touched a high of 11.8% in 2021-22, up from 10.7% in 2020-21.""This also had a domino effect on private sector investment that jumped from 10 per cent to 10.8% over the same period,"" it said.In fact, Ecowrap added that the trends in GCF to gross output ratio or the plough back of funds for creation of fresh capacity shows that for public administration the ratio attained fresh peak in 2021-22 owing to the emphasis on capital expenditure in recent budgets.At the aggregate level, gross capital formation is supposed to have crossed 32% in 2022-23, the highest level since 2018-19.According to the report, in 2021-22, gross savings have risen to 30% from 29% in 2020-21.""The ratio is supposed to have crossed 31 per cent in 2022-23, the highest since 2018-19. The household savings increased sharply during the pandemic period on account of sharp accretion in financial savings such as deposits,"" said the report by SBI's Economic Research Department.While household financial savings have since then moderated from 15.4% in 2020-21 to 11.1% in 2022-23, savings in physical assets have grown sharply to 11.8% in 2021-22 from 10.7% in 2020-21.The report further analysed Incremental Capital Output ratio (ICOR) -- which measures additional units of capital (investment) needed to produce additional units of output. It said that the ratio has been improving.""ICOR which was 7.5 in FY 12 is now only 3.5 in FY22. Clearly, only half of capital is now needed for next unit of output,"" the report noted.Such reducing ICOR in the current years reflects a relatively increasing efficiency of capital and shows that the economy is on a sound footing, the report said.""From that point of view, future GDP growth rates even at 7% could still mean a decent number by any standards!,"" it added.","India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.

An employee is entitled for a 50 per cent amount of the last drawn salary as pension.OPS was discontinued by the NDA government in 2003 with effect from April 1, 2004.Under the new pension scheme (NPS), employees contribute 10 per cent of their basic salary towards pension while the government contributes 14 per cent.Governments of Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand have informed the central government/ Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA about their decision to restart OPS for their employees.The government of Punjab on November 18, 2022, issued a notification regarding implementation of OPS for the state government employees who are being covered under NPS. Jharkhand too has decided to revert to OPS.",Former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan has expressed his concern over the decision of some states to restart the old pension scheme.

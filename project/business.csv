"World Bank clears Rs 5,700 crore for 'Jal Sanrakshit' Haryana, canal revival and micro-irrigation at core",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/world-bank-clears-rs-5700-crore-for-jal-sanrakshit-haryana-canal-revival-and-micro-irrigation-at-core/articleshow/127413697.cms,"AI image

The World Bank has approved technical and financial assistance of Rs 5,700 crore for Haryana under the ‘Jal Sanrakshit Haryana Project’, aimed at making the state self-reliant in the water sector, Chief Minister Nayab Singh Saini said on Saturday.Chairing a review meeting on the programme, Saini said the funds will be released in phases between 2026 and 2032 and will be used primarily for large-scale canal restoration, micro-irrigation, groundwater recharge and sustainable agriculture initiatives.According to the official plan, Haryana has 1,570 canals, of which 892 have been restored over the past two decades. The remaining 678 canals are proposed to be completed over the next five years. This includes restoration of 115 canals at a cost of Rs 2,325 crore with World Bank support, 284 canals costing Rs 2,230 crore from the state budget, and 279 canals worth Rs 2,880 crore through NABARD funding.The Chief Minister said similar work is planned for minor canals. Of the 15,562 minor canals under the Micro Irrigation & Command Area Development Authority, 4,487 have already been restored, while 1,961 will be taken up over the next five years.This includes 400 minor canals costing Rs 450 crore with World Bank assistance, 1,500 minor canals worth Rs 1,250 crore funded by the state, and 61 canals costing Rs 402 crore through NABARD.With World Bank support of Rs 900 crore, micro-irrigation systems will also be implemented across nearly 70,000 acres of farmland. The Agriculture Department will develop tube-well-based and surface drainage systems to address waterlogging across around 2 lakh acres, while crop diversification, direct seeding of rice and other water-conservation practices will be promoted with assistance of about Rs 886 crore.The project also includes construction of around 80 new water bodies in southern Haryana to boost groundwater recharge. Treated water from sewage treatment plants in Jind, Kaithal and Gurugram will be reused to irrigate nearly 28,000 acres, supported by World Bank funding of about Rs 600 crore.Saini said the World Bank described the ‘Jal Sanrakshit Haryana’ programme as a “paradigm shift” in the state’s water management approach. He added that once completed, the entire canal network would be fully lined and capable of operating efficiently for the next 25 years, reducing the need for repeated restoration spending.On completion, irrigation facilities will expand to an additional 2 lakh acres, farmers will get relief from waterlogging, and fresh water currently used for irrigation can be conserved for drinking purposes, the Chief Minister said, urging farmers to adopt micro-irrigation systems, particularly for paddy cultivation.","The funds will be released in phases between 2026 and 2032. They will be used primarily for large-scale canal restoration, micro-irrigation, groundwater recharge and sustainable agriculture initiatives. Haryana has 1,570 canals, of which 892 have been restored over the past two decades.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127414010,imgsize-1615718,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"
Investors’ expectations from Union Budget 2026,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/investors-expectations-from-union-budget-2026/articleshow/127404991.cms,"By Devendra Agrawal

For Investors:

For angel investors:

Deloitte Partner Says Budget Must Fix GST Gaps, Cut Costs, Boost Domestic Manufacturing

Bring sale of AIF units at par with sale of shares.

Government as venture debt provider.

Invest wisely in deep tech:

For taxation:

a) Introduce taxation at household level.

b) Widen India’s tax net.

(Devendra Agrawal, Founder, Dexter Capital Advisors, a boutique investment bank)

The recent Supreme Court judgement that has gone against Tiger Global may dampen the confidence of any global investor because anything that’s agreed in the past is open for interpretation. And while that may lead to short-term benefit of recovering the taxes from one investor, in the long run it might have a negative impact on the larger investor community. They may feel the country may not be trusted with the laws laid by the previous governments. The budget should provide clarity or simplify the laws, especially for global investors.Ideally, the government should unleash private capital for startups. The recent SEBI regulations for angel investing have increased the accreditation. Earlier, any individual/HUFs/Family Trusts/Sole proprietorships with net worth greater than Rs 2 crore (excluding the value of their primary residence) could be angel investors. Now, the net worth has to be equal or greater than Rs 7.5 cr, out of which at least Rs 3.75 cr is in the form of financial assets (excluding the value of their primary residence).If someone keeps PPP (purchasing power parity) in mind, it is ridiculously high and removes a number of people from the purview of investing.The government should definitely make a uniform policy for accredited investors but with fewer norms. And before angel investors, I think, the government should look at F&Os as they are even riskier and more speculative. Angel investing drives capital formation.When any investor invests in any Alternate Investment Fund (AIF), the investor gets units of AIF. Now, often these investments are illiquid and AIF units can't be easily transferred. If an investor gets a willing buyer to transfer the AIF unit, another challenge is that AIF units are valued on Fair Market Value (FMV).In comparison, when underlined securities like shares in a company are sold, the transaction does not need to be at FMV, as long as they are sold above book value.So, there's a disparity between sale of IAF units vs sale of shares of underlying companies held by these AIFs.Doing away this disparity can bring selling of AIF units at par with selling shares and would increase liquidity in a situation where an investor in AIF wants to sell AIF units.This would definitely bring more liquidity, increase participation of investors in alternate investment funds.This is completely as per the tax laws of the country. It's just that the finance ministry has not taken this into consideration in record.The government recently approved Rs 5,000 crore in equity support for the SIDBI to help expand credit flow to the MSME sector. The government invests in startups at a 6% rate with secured assets. To help more startups raise capital from the government and for the government to benefit from it, the government may consider investing at an increased rate – 8% – but without a secured asset as long as the startup is certified and thoroughly evaluated.This could help in bringing down India’s very high venture debt, at 13-18%. The government could provide, say, a tech-driven company which has built a prototype, an 8% yield and can have a warrant structure. So that such a portfolio asset has mortality. Those warrants will yield a much higher rate of return even if a small percentage, like less than 10% of these companies, become wildly successful. So, the government could become a de facto venture debt provider or a collateral-free loan provider.The government recently built a Rs 1 lakh crore fund for deep tech without having a very clear definition of deep tech. This amount is slightly on the higher side in terms of deep tech. The government could probably allocate a certain portion of this fund towards deep tech and the remaining fund could be allocated towards other avenues as well.We should applaud the Finance Minister and the government for two big releases. First, for rationalizing taxes to INR 12 lakh for the common man. Second, the GST reform. However, there are two recommendations that I would like to make:India follows an individual-focused income tax system, where each person’s annual income is evaluated and then taxed.Introducing taxation at household level will give assesses the scope for rationalizing/reducing their tax burden. Assesses should have the option of filing their returns as a household or as an individual.If the cumulative income of a household is lesser than a particular threshold, then taxation should be lesser. For example, if a household consisting of a married couple--where both husband and wife are earning—has a cumulative income of Rs 30 lakh then the tax rate could be 20% and not the current 30%.The idea behind household-level taxation is that the family’s ability to pay depends on the shared expenses, not just individual income. This concept could definitely be explored and introduced.Less than 4% of the population pays income tax in India. This increases the tax burden on the salaried class, middle class. In comparison, ~60% of households in the US pay federal income tax and ~10-14% of the Chinese working population pays income tax. The government and other stakeholders should find a way to bring more working people under the tax bracket to reduce the overall tax burden on the salaried class. I feel one way to do this could be to incentivize high tax payers by publicly recognizing and rewarding them.","The recent Supreme Court judgement that has gone against Tiger Global may dampen the confidence of any global investor because anything that’s agreed in the past is open for interpretation.Ideally, the government should unleash private capital for startups.

Can Donald Trump’s mortgage bond push lower home loan rates? New Fannie–Freddie limits reignite risk debate,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/can-donald-trumps-mortgage-bond-push-lower-home-loan-rates-new-fanniefreddie-limits-reignite-risk-debate/articleshow/127409921.cms,"Cap hike revives post-crisis risk concerns



Political pressure meets market scepticism



Pulte’s tenure under scrutiny



The Trump administration has quietly expanded the scope for government-backed mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to buy far more mortgage bonds than previously allowed, a move aimed at lowering home loan rates but one that has revived concerns about financial risk and policy overreach.According to an internal email obtained by the Associated Press, the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), under director Bill Pulte, has lifted portfolio caps that earlier limited Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to holding no more than $40 billion each in mortgage bonds. The January 12 directive raises that ceiling to $225 billion apiece, effective immediately, AP reported.If fully utilised, the change would allow the two lenders to increase bond purchases by roughly $170 billion beyond the $200 billion buying programme President Donald Trump had publicly ordered to push mortgage rates lower.The move effectively reverses nearly two decades of bipartisan policy consensus put in place after the 2008–09 financial crisis, when excessive risk-taking by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac forced a government bailout and placed both firms under federal conservatorship.While both entities remain subject to a broader Treasury cap of $450 billion on mortgage investment portfolios, analysts say the new flexibility allows them to adopt a far more aggressive approach to bond buying, potentially increasing systemic risk.Neither Pulte nor the FHFA clarified whether Trump or Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent was consulted before the caps were raised. After the report surfaced, Pulte dismissed it as “fake news” on X, saying FHFA had merely given “legal flexibility” and that the firms would not exceed $200 billion in purchases.Following publication, the agency issued an additional statement saying, “Fannie and Freddie will not be allowed to go beyond the president’s buy.”The expansion comes amid heightened political pressure to show progress on mortgage affordability ahead of US midterm elections. However, lawmakers and economists remain sceptical that bond purchases alone can sustainably lower rates without addressing housing supply constraints.“This is just a smoke screen for Trump and Bill Pulte to tweet about — it will do little, if anything, to lower mortgage interest rates over the long term and raises questions about increased risks to Fannie and Freddie,” said Senator Elizabeth Warren, the top Democrat on the Senate banking committee.Housing experts also note that any temporary dip in borrowing costs could simply translate into higher home prices if supply remains tight.Edward Pinto of the American Enterprise Institute described Trump’s initial bond-buying plan as a “sugar high,” adding that “it may have an effect, but it will be fleeting.”The episode adds to scrutiny of Bill Pulte’s unusually high-profile tenure at FHFA, a role traditionally kept out of political spotlight. Pulte has appointed himself chair of both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, overseen senior management firings, and pushed controversial policy ideas, including a 50-year mortgage proposal that critics say would sharply raise long-term borrowing costs.The FHFA email instructed the two firms to increase bond investments to “exert meaningful downward pressure” on mortgage rates, and notably said that the “commencement of increases” would not require prior agency approval — a point that has raised further alarm among market watchers.“It's easy for the federal government to make a mistake here. They've done it in the past,” said Jim Parrott, a former National Economic Council official under President Barack Obama.With mortgage rates once again a political flashpoint, critics warn that loosening constraints on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac risks reopening old fault lines in the US housing finance system, even as the long-term impact on affordability remains uncertain.","Government-backed mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac can buy far more mortgage bonds than previously allowed. The move is aimed at lowering home loan rates but has revived concerns about financial risk and policy overreach. If fully utilised, the change would allow the two lenders to increase bond purchases by roughly $170 billion.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127410150,imgsize-1932983,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"
"Bond market funds 76% of states' deficit, up from 50% in FY17",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/bond-market-funds-76-of-states-deficit-up-from-50-in-fy17/articleshow/127501220.cms,"ANI file photo

.

MUMBAI: A study of state finances by RBI shows that while the fiscal deficit of Indian states has widened modestly in recent years, funding patterns have become more market-driven and disciplined, with growth headroom differing sharply between younger and more mature states.The consolidated gross fiscal deficit of states peaked at 4.1% of GDP in 2020-21 during the pandemic, before easing to below 3% for three years and rising again to 3.3% in 2024-25. RBI said the recent widening was driven by weaker revenue receipts, largely due to lower grants from the Centre, and higher capital spending. Part of the breach above 3% reflects 50-year, interest-free loans from the Centre, which are above normal borrowing limits. For 2025-26, states have budgeted the deficit at 3.3% of GDP, with higher revenues offset by higher expenditure.The consolidated deficit remains within the Centre's ceiling of 3.5% of GDP, which includes a 0.5% allowance linked to power sector reforms. However, state-level positions vary widely. Sixteen states have budgeted deficits above 3% of GSDP for 2025-26, with 13 of them exceeding 3.5%, highlighting uneven fiscal space across states.Market borrowing has emerged as the main source of funding. According to RBI's study, market loans are expected to finance about 76% of the consolidated fiscal deficit in 2025-26, compared with just over half before 2016-17. Gross market borrowing rose 6.6% to Rs 10.7 lakh crore in 2024-25 and is budgeted at Rs 12.5 lakh crore in 2025-26. By end-Sept 2025, states had raised Rs 4.7 lakh crore, 21% higher than a year earlier.The borrowing profile has also improved. States have increasingly issued longer-maturity securities, with a rising share of bonds beyond 10 and 15 years, and some issuing paper of over 20 years. Borrowing costs eased, with the weighted average yield falling to 7.2% in 2024-25 from 7.5% a year earlier, while spreads over central govt securities narrowed to 30 basis points.The quality of state finances has strengthened as well. The share of revenue deficit in the gross fiscal deficit has dropped from 46.1% in 2020-21 to a budgeted 6.9% in 2025-26, while the share of capital expenditure in total spending has risen from 13.4% to 18%.Demography is emerging as a key differentiator. Younger states such as Bihar, UP and Madhya Pradesh have greater scope to expand revenues on the back of a growing working-age population, while intermediate states like Maharashtra and Karnataka must balance growth with preparation for ageing. For ageing states such as Kerala and Tamil Nadu, fiscal pressures are set to rise as tax bases narrow and pension and healthcare costs increase, forcing a rethink of revenue and workforce policies.","Fiscal deficit of Indian states has widened modestly in recent years.

'India Turns Green Power Into Growth Story', Pralhad Joshi Tells World Leaders At WEF Davos 2026

Timely subsidies, improved revenue help Punjab power corp post 677% profit jump

.

NEW DELHI: Record profits at Maharashtra and Punjab's power distribution companies, backed by strong showings of a handful of other govt and almost all private discoms, dragged the sector out of the red, turning a Rs 27,022 crore combined loss last financial year into a Rs 2,701 crore profit in FY2024-25 (FY25).Though India's power distributors have posted a profit at last ending a long season of losses, the needle of the accumulated losses over the last two decades of all power utilities have only moved slightly from Rs 6.9 lakh crore loss in FY 2023-24 to Rs 6.5 lakh crore in FY 2024-25.Outstanding loans, which includes the borrowings from state govts, fell to Rs 7.3 lakh crore in 2024-25 from Rs 7.6 lakh crore in the previous fiscal, according to the report prepared by Union ministry of power.Of the 42 state-owned discoms that were rated, 25 posted profit in FY25.Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL), which caters to nearly 95 lakh consumers in the agrarian state, led the pack by posting a 677% jump in profits, largely due to the timely release of subsidies and improved revenue.The discoms of North Bihar and South Bihar, Ajmer, Tamil Nadu and Paschim Gujarat also helped the sector record cumulative profits for the first time since the corporatisation of state electricity boards.Of 72 state-run and private discoms and power departments, the govt looked at the data of 65 — to arrive at these figures. The data of seven discoms — four private, two state-owned and one power departments — was not available.State electricity boards in Maharashtra, Kerala, Himachal Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh Paschim, Manipur and Jodhpur emerged from losses reported a year earlier and registered healthy net profits in FY25. All 12 private discoms that govt rated were in profit, as always.According to the govt’s 14th Integrated Rating and Ranking Report, despite posting healthy net profits, the losses incurred by Punjab’s discoms due to energy lost during transmission, theft, metering losses and billing inefficiencies (known as AT&C) rose from nearly 11% in 2023-24 to 19.2% a year later.In contrast, similar losses declined in Maharashtra (from 23.9% in FY24 to 17.7% in FY25), Bihar (from 20.3% to 15.5%) and Kerala (from 7.4% to 6.6%). Overall AT&C losses also fell from 16% to 15%.Power minister Manohar Lal Khattar, at an industry event last week, attributed the turnaround to the release of subsidies accumulated over the years by respective state govts and the recovery of dues.“Many states were not releasing subsidy amounts on time. We made sustained efforts over the past year, which led some states to fast-track the payments. This became a major reason for discoms turning profitable,” Khattar said.Billing efficiency improved across 46 utilities, while better collection efficiency was recorded for 29 discoms. The four power distribution companies of Gujarat were the only state-run utilities to report accumulated surpluses, apart from private discoms.","Of the 42 state-owned discoms that were rated, 25 posted profit in FY25.

CHENNAI: Calendar year 2025 proved a strong year for India-built motorcycles, with exports reaching their highest-ever annual volume, up 27% from 2024 shipments. Total motorcycle exports touched a fresh post-pandemic peak in 2025, rising to 4.3 million units, even as domestic volumes remained below their earlier highs.""A combination of India's competitive manufacturing capabilities and a well-established global distribution network has enabled the country's motorcycle exports to maintain strong growth momentum,"" said Poonam Upadhyay, director, Crisil Ratings.In the pre-pandemic phase (2017-2019), motorcycle exports were on a gradual upward trajectory, rising from 2.3 million units in 2017 to 3.1 million units in 2019, which marked the earlier peak before Covid disrupted global trade in 2020. While exports dipped briefly during the first pandemic year, they rebounded strongly thereafter, with 2021 already surpassing pre-pandemic levels. Despite some volatility in the intervening years, exports climbed to 4.3 million units in 2025, the highest level in the series. This marks an increase of nearly 40% over the 2019 pre-pandemic peak.Stronger penetration into overseas markets and a widening export basket by leading players such as Bajaj Auto and TVS Motor were among the key factors driving the rise in motorcycle exports from India.""The robust export performance was fuelled by healthy demand from multiple emerging markets. Latin America was a standout contributor, led by Colombia and Brazil, while Africa remained a significant market, with Nigeria being a key destination. Improved foreign currency availability in key markets such as Latin America and Africa also supported export growth. Besides, Asian markets, including Nepal and the Philippines, provided a further boost,"" Upadhyay said.In 2025, Bajaj Auto (43%) and TVS Motor (29%) together accounted for about 72% of total motorcycle exports. Bajaj's motorcycle exports grew from 1.6 million units in 2024 to 1.9 million units in 2025, while TVS Motor's shipments rose from 0.9 million units to 1.3 million units.","Total motorcycle exports touched a fresh post-pandemic peak in 2025, rising to 4.3 million units.

MUMBAI: Chiefs of India's consumer companies are seeking more tax cuts, wider measures to put money in the hands of the middle-class and support consumption, which has begun to look up after months of sluggishness but runs the risk of being buffeted by external macro factors.CEOs are also pinning hopes on the Budget to provide for measures to shield local industries against volatile commodity prices. ""The Budget can support recovery in consumption by strengthening purchasing power, particularly in price-sensitive urban and rural markets. At the same time, allocate budget and take initiatives to improve agri/farm sector to ensure steady input prices which can help FMCG companies manage costs without passing them on to consumers,"" said Mayank Shah, vice-president at Parle Products.There should be a focus on increasing disposable incomes and supporting middle-class first-time buyers of consumer durables, a sector where consumption has been hit by adverse commodity costs and currency depreciation (import costs go up when rupee weakens), said Kamal Nandi, business head and EVP at appliances business of Godrej Enterprises Group.""Additionally, measures that help ease cost pressures - such as stable import duties on essential raw materials and support for domestic manufacturing will allow companies to avoid passing the full benefit of cost inflation to consumers,"" Nandi said.There are a few large, mass-consumption FMCG categories, especially in home care that continue to be taxed at 18% and could move to a lower slab such as 5% to aid demand, said Sudhir Sitapati, MD & CEO at Godrej Consumer Products.The industry is also looking for meaningful support to manage input-cost volatility, particularly in categories impacted by inverted duty structures under GST which lock up working capital and add to cost pressures for manufacturers, added Prashant Peres, GM, India at Mars Snacking.

.

NEW DELHI: Amid outflows, foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) have sought a review of the taxes applicable on them, especially capital gains.Those familiar with the deliberations said the issue has been raised with market regulator Sebi as well as govt officials with certainty in tax policies being underlined repeatedly.Apart from high cost of trading in India due to several levies and charges - brokerage, stamp duty, securities transaction tax (STT), Sebi turnover fees, exchange transaction fees and custody fees - representatives of FPIs have also argued that for certain overseas investors, there is double taxation due to capital gains tax.These players have argued that FPIs face capital gains tax on their investments in Indian securities. Besides, investors in these funds can be taxed again in their home countries when they receive the distribution from the FPI. Further, they have argued that foreign tax credits - capital gains tax paid by FPIs to be used as credits to offset taxes on the investors in the investor's home country - are often unavailable or difficult to obtain in practice.""This is because of the way investments are typically made (through funds), and also due to the complex foreign tax credit regimes,"" a tax expert said.The funds have argued that India remains among a few countries globally that levies STT as well as capital gains tax, which was not the case until 2018. Before 2004, capital gains on listed equity securities were taxable in India, but LTCG was abolished in this segment when STT was introduced in 2004. In 2018, LTCG on listed equity transactions made a comeback - at 10% over a specified threshold, which was increased to 12.5% last year.A tax specialist at a leading consulting firm said that to the higher cost, there is a loss of attractiveness for the Indian market at this time. In addition, computation related issues, restrictions on set-off of capital losses under specific situations and delays in refunds have been flagged.So far this year, FPIs have sold equity of Rs 33,600 crore on a net basis, the highest monthly sales since Aug when they were sellers to the tune of Rs 35,000 crore. In 2025, FPIs' net sales were pegged at nearly Rs 1.7 lakh crore, according to data on the NSDL website.","Foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) have sought a review of the taxes applicable on them, especially capital gains.

In the week ending January 16, the spot gold surged nearly 2% to close at $4595. The rally in the week came on the heels of a sharp 4.6% rise in the week ending January 9.

Driven by safe haven demand as the US President on January 17 threatened 8 EU nations with 10% tariffs beginning February 1 in retaliation to their opposition to his Greenland plans, the yellow metal extended its rally to a fresh record high of $4690 on January 19.

At the time of writing this article, the shiny metal was changing hands at $4672 (MCX February contract Rs 145,500), up 1.67% for the day.

ETF and COMEX gold inventory:

As of January 16, total known global gold ETF holdings stood at 99.86 MOz, highest since August 2022, and are up nearly 1% YTD, as holdings rose for the second straight week.

Registered COMEX gold inventory at 18.86 MOz, is up around 1 MOz from the cycle low of 17.86 MOz but is down over 22% from the record peak of 24.25 MOz seen on April 7.

EU's Huge Greenland Reveal After Trump Backs Off On Tariff Threat Over Invasion Protest

While US President Donald Trump 's tariff threats over Greenland dominated the narrative for broader equity markets last week, investors were hedging risks elsewhere.

Meanwhile, away from the Trump-driven headlines that moved the broader indexes and the VIX, some investors were putting on hedges against geopolitical risks that could pressure shares of Chinese companies and against the potential for disappointing tech earnings.","US President Donald Trump's tariff threats over Greenland dominated the narrative for broader equity markets last week.

A massive winter storm disrupted air travel across the United States on Sunday, triggering widespread flight cancellations and delays at some of the country’s busiest airports and setting up what airlines warned would be a brutal travel day.The National Weather Service said late Saturday that widespread snow, sleet and freezing rain threatened nearly 180 million people more than half the US population across a vast stretch from the southern Rocky Mountains to New England.After sweeping through the southern US, forecasters said the storm was expected to intensify over the Northeast, dumping 1 to 2 feet (30 to 60 centimetres) of snow from Washington through New York and Boston.The severe weather led to massive disruptions across the aviation network.More than 14,000 flights have been cancelled across the US since Saturday, according to flight-tracking site FlightAware, with nearly 10,000 cancellations scheduled for Sunday alone, the Associated Press reported.Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport warned travellers on its website of widespread cancellations, noting that nearly all departing flights, 420 flights, or 99% were cancelled for the day.Major airport hubs including Dallas-Fort Worth, Charlotte, Philadelphia and Atlanta, home to the nation’s busiest airport, were hit, along with New York’s John F. Kennedy International Airport and LaGuardia Airport.American Airlines cancelled over 1,400 flights on Sunday, about 45% of its scheduled operations, FlightAware data showed.Delta Air Lines and Southwest Airlines each reported more than 1,200 cancellations, while United Airlines cancelled over 860 flights. JetBlue scrapped more than 570 flights, accounting for roughly 71% of its schedule for the day.If you are already at the airport, airlines advise getting in line to speak with a customer service representative. If you are still at home or at a hotel, passengers should call or go online to contact the airline’s reservations staff. Travellers are also advised to research alternate flights while waiting to speak to an agent.Most airlines will rebook passengers on a later flight at no extra charge, subject to seat availability.Passengers can seek to be booked on another airline, but carriers are not required to place travellers on a competing airline’s flight. Some airlines, including major carriers, may offer rebooking on partner airlines, though availability is not guaranteed, the Associated Press reported.If a flight is cancelled and a passenger chooses not to travel or finds another way to reach their destination, the airline is legally required to issue a refund, even for non-refundable tickets. The rule applies regardless of the reason for the cancellation.","More than 14,000 flights have been cancelled across the US since Saturday, according to flight-tracking site FlightAware.

How can passengers reach airline support more easily during major disruptions?

US air travel is seeing widespread disruptions as a powerful winter storm moves across large parts of the country, forcing at least 13,000 flight cancellations over the weekend and affecting major airports. Forecasters have warned that damage, particularly in areas hit by ice, could be catastrophic and comparable to a hurricane.By mid-morning on Saturday, flight cancellations had dominated departures from several major airports, with Memphis, Oklahoma City and Dallas–Fort Worth among the worst affected. Significant disruption was also reported in Austin, Charlotte and Nashville, while airports in Washington and New York were expected to see conditions worsen as the storm continued.Here is what you need to know:When airlines anticipate weather-related disruption, they often allow passengers to postpone trips by a few days without paying a change fee. For example, American Airlines is waiving change fees for passengers impacted by the storm and adding extra flights across the country to help travellers reach their destinations once conditions improve.Travellers are advised to search online for their airline’s name along with terms such as “travel alerts” to check for rescheduling offers.In case passengers need to proceed, they should use their airline’s app to confirm whether their flight is still operating before leaving for the airport. Cancellations can be announced hours or even days before departure.By mid-day Saturday, American Airlines and Delta Air Lines had each cancelled more than 1,000 scheduled Sunday flights, according to FlightAware. Oklahoma’s largest airport suspended all flights on Saturday. Dallas–Fort Worth International Airport saw more than 700 departing flights cancelled and nearly as many arriving flights called off. Disruptions were also reported at airports in Chicago, Atlanta, Nashville and Charlotte, North Carolina.Passengers at the airport should speak to a customer service representative. Those at home or in a hotel should contact the airline online or by phone. Travellers are encouraged to research alternative flights while waiting to speak to an agent.Most airlines will rebook passengers on a later flight at no additional charge, depending on seat availability. However, though most major carriers, say they can rebook passengers on partner airlines, this is not guaranteed.Yes. If a flight is cancelled and the passenger no longer wants to travel, or has found another way to reach the destination, the airline is legally required to issue a refund, even for non-refundable tickets. The reason for the cancellation does not matter.Passengers are entitled to a full ticket refund, as well as refunds for unused baggage fees, seat upgrades or other extras. Airlines may offer travel credits, but passengers are entitled to a cash refund.According to the US Department of Transportation, refunds for credit card payments must be issued within seven business days after a passenger declines an alternative flight or voucher. Refunds for tickets purchased with cash or cheque must be issued within 20 calendar days.US airlines are not required to compensate passengers for meals or lodging when flights are cancelled or significantly delayed due to an “uncontrollable” event such as bad weather.Customer service phone lines are often overwhelmed during major storms. Travellers can try using priority phone numbers linked to higher frequent-flyer status or calling an airline’s international support number, where agents can often assist with rebooking.","US air travel is seeing widespread disruptions as a powerful winter storm moves across large parts of the country.

US Fed set to keep rates steady as officials defend independence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-fed-set-to-keep-rates-steady-as-officials-defend-independence/articleshow/127444298.cms,"External pressure

The US Federal Reserve is widely expected to keep interest rates unchanged when it meets in the coming week, holding firm despite President Donald Trump's pressure to slash levels as it guards against threats to its independence.The central bank has cut rates three consecutive times since September as the jobs market weakened, bringing them to a range between 3.50 percent and 3.75 percent.But Fed Chair Jerome Powell has signaled the bar would be higher for a further reduction in January. They meet on Tuesday and Wednesday.""The fact that growth is strong, unemployment is low, equity markets are close to all-time highs and inflation is above target all argue for a pause,"" said analysts at ING bank.Powell's robust defense of Fed independence in response to ongoing pressure from Trump to lower rates confirms this, ING added.On January 11, Powell released a rare, solemn statement revealing that the Department of Justice was investigating him over a $2.5 billion renovation of the bank's headquarters.He slammed the threat of criminal charges as the result of policymakers setting rates in the public's best interests -- rather than bowing to the president's wishes.Trump has made no secret of his disdain for Powell, claiming there is ""no inflation"" and repeatedly questioning the Fed chair's competence and integrity.Yet, US inflation has been well above the bank's two-percent target for over five years, said former Cleveland Fed president Loretta Mester.""I think the Fed needs to keep a pretty tight eye on where the inflation is going,"" she told AFP.Price increases could cool after Trump's trade tariffs filter through the world's biggest economy, but Mester flagged the need for ""more convincing evidence.""Meanwhile, existing cost hikes have brought about a ""large wedge"" between how affluent and lower-income households view the economy, said KPMG chief economist Diane Swonk.Even if the gap could temporarily narrow as fiscal stimulus hits in early 2026 -- with a rise in tax refunds incoming due to tax cut expansions -- this could ""cause a more entrenched bout of inflation,"" she warned.Another complication is stagnating employment, forcing policymakers to walk a tightrope between lowering rates to boost the economy and keeping them higher to curb inflation.The Fed meets eight times a year to consider interest rate levels, and Michael Pearce of Oxford Economics said the dilemma it faces has eased.Figures suggest that risks to the labor market appear less pressing than a few months ago, while the likelihood of rising inflation also seems to have moderated, he said in a note.Nonetheless, events outside of the rate-setting committee ""have the potential to shake up the path of monetary policy,"" Pearce added.Besides the probe into Powell, Trump has sought to fire Fed Governor Lisa Cook, sparking a legal battle crucial to shaping how much discretion the president has in changing the Fed's leadership.A president can only fire Fed board members ""for cause,"" traditionally understood to mean malfeasance or dereliction of duty.But the Trump administration appears to be pushing a broader interpretation, as Trump moved to fire Cook over mortgage fraud allegations she denies.The Supreme Court heard arguments on the issue on Wednesday, and Cook stressed in a statement afterwards the importance of insulating the Fed from political threats.She said her case is about whether the Fed will set rates ""guided by evidence and independent judgment or will succumb to political pressure.""Pearce flagged a ""small risk"" that the government succeeds in ousting Cook, saying this could ""pave the way for a substantial dovish transformation on the committee over time.""Policymakers seen as ""hawkish"" favor higher rates to fight inflation, while a ""dovish"" Fed tends towards lower levels.Analysts expect Powell to avoid discussing political issues at his press briefing after the two-day Fed meeting on Wednesday, while divisions remain over the path of future policy.","The US Federal Reserve is widely expected to keep interest rates unchanged when it meets in the coming week.

Trump Threatens Canada With 100% Tariff Over China Trade Push After Carney’s Beijing Visit

: US President Donald Trump threatened to impose a 100 per cent tax on Canada if it strikes a trade deal with China, reversing his position last week when he said he was okay with such a trade deal.In a social media post on Saturday, Trump appeared to have changed his mind while lashing out at Canadian PM Mark Carney, saying “if he thinks he is going to make Canada a 'Drop Off Port' for China to send goods and products into the United States, he is sorely mistaken.”“China will eat Canada alive, completely devour it, including the destruction of their businesses, social fabric, and general way of life. If Canada makes a deal with China, it will immediately be hit with a 100% Tariff against all Canadian goods and products coming into the U.S.A,” Trump said, referring to the Canadian PM as “Governor Carney.”Trump’s threat follows a remarkable address by Carney to global leaders at Davos where the Canadian PM raised the banner of revolt against U.S hegemony, warning that in a world of great power rivalry, the countries in between have a choice: to compete with each other for favor or to combine to create a third path with impact.“Middle powers must act together because if we are not at the table, we are on the menu,” Carney said in an address that was widely acclaimed across the world.The open swipe at the U.S appears to have enraged Trump, who only last week had said if Carney struck a deal with China – which he did when he visited Beijing ahead of Davos – he should do it and he (Trump) was okay with it.But at Davos, where Carney was the toast of the global leadership, the U.S President turned sour, complaining that Canada gets many ""freebies"" from the US and ""should be grateful,"" and Carney's remarks showed he ""wasn't so grateful.""“Canada lives because of the United States,” Trump said in remarks that offended many Canadians and provoked Carney to retort that ""Canada does not ‘live because of the United States.’ Canada thrives because we are Canadian.""""We are masters in our own house. This is our country. This is our future. The choice is ours,” Carney asserted, stating that Canada must be a ""beacon"" in an era of ""democratic decline” and arguing that Canada’s success is built on values like inclusivity and diversity, a swipe at Trumpian America that believes whites are being displaced and sidelined by immigration.Trump has previously talked about making Canada the 51st state, and this week he posted an altered image of a map of the US that included Canada, Greenland, Venezuela and Cuba as part of its territory. The trolling has taken its toll of two centuries of amicable U.S-Canada ties that has resulted in the longest and mostly unguarded border in the world.A 100 per cent tariff on Canadian goods and products will be devastating for Ottawa, which is Washington's second largest trade partner after Mexico. For the full year of 2025, total bilateral trade in goods and services is estimated to have crossed $900 billion, racking up a surplus of more than $85 billion.",US President Donald Trump threatened to impose a 100 per cent tax on Canada if it strikes a trade deal with China.

US Says 25% Tariff Forced India Oil Shift, Signals Removal, Slams EU Silence On Russian Crude

: US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent signaled a prospective removal of the 25 per cent penalty tariffs on India for its purchase of Russian oil, citing “success” in Washington’s pressure tactics while appearing to disapprove the outreach of the European Union, which is on the verge of concluding a Free Trade Agreement with New Delhi.""We put 25 per cent tariffs on India for buying Russian oil, and the Indian purchases by their refineries of Russian oil have collapsed. So that is a success. The tariffs are still on. I would imagine there is a path to take them off, so that's a check and a huge success,"" Bessent said in remarks at Davos, even as the US and India continued efforts to narrow gaps to conclude their own trade agreement.Bessent noted that pre-Ukraine invasion, Russia supplied only 2-3% of India's oil, which rose into the high teens but has now come down due to the US pressure via tariffs. By some estimates, there has been a 29% month-on-month reduction in Russian crude imports by India—going down to their lowest levels since 2022, but not reaching zero.He also contrasted this approach with that of Europe, criticizing the EU for not imposing similar tariffs on New Delhi and instead buying refined Russian oil products from India, calling it an ""ultimate act of irony and stupidity"" for indirectly funding Moscow’s war effort.Some critics have pointed out that the US itself was buying Russian uranium till very recently and the Trump administration’s deference towards Russia on the Ukraine issue is not helping end the war either.Bessent’s remarks came even as the EU and India are on the verge of concluding a free trade agreement that has been in the works for nearly 20 years, a development that appeared to irk Washington, which is on the rampage against rest of the world claiming the US has been “ripped off.”In a separate development, President Trump lashed out at Canada for its recent trade deals with China, threatening a 100 per cent tariff against Ottawa for turning itself into a “drop-off port” for channeling Chinese goods into the US.While Bessent held out the possibility of removing the Russian oil tariffs on India, his colleague commerce secretary Howard Lutnick, suggested last week that the U.S-India trade deal was held up because Prime Minister Narendra Modi had not picked up the phone to call President Trump.But New Delhi has rejected the claim, saying PM Modi had spoken to the President at least three or four times since op sindoor to discuss a wide range of issues.

Sanctioned Serbian oil firm's licence extended by US,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/sanctioned-serbian-oil-firms-licence-extended-by-us/articleshow/127352151.cms,"NIS's assets

The United States has extended a temporary operating licence for Serbia's sanctioned oil company, the latter's energy minister confirmed on Friday, as negotiations continue over the exit of Russian majority shareholders.Washington's sanctions on the Petroleum Industry of Serbia (NIS), part of its crackdown on Russia's energy sector, have previously forced a months-long shutdown of the country's only oil refinery.Production restarted earlier this month after a temporary reprieve was granted by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), which was due to expire at midnight.But according to Serbian Energy Minister Dubravka Djedovic Handanovic, the licence has now been extended until February 20.""We have secured almost an additional month for NIS to continue operating, to be supplied via the Adriatic Oil Pipeline, JANAF, and for crude to continue arriving in Serbia,"" Handanovic told local TV Pink.A previous March 24 deadline remains for negotiations over the full exit of Gazprom's interest in the company, with Hungarian energy giant MOL agreeing to basic terms with Russian firm earlier this week.After months of delay, Washington imposed sanctions on NIS on October 9, cutting off supplies to the refinery.The move has had a strong impact in Serbia, a close Kremlin ally and one of the few European states not to sanction Russia over the war in Ukraine.NIS employs about 13,500 people in Serbia and contributed over two billion euros ($2.5 billion) in tax revenue in 2024 or nearly 12 percent of the national budget.The company operates around 330 petrol stations, roughly one in five nationwide, and if acquired by MOL, the combined network would exceed 380 stations.The company also operates in Bosnia, Romania, Bulgaria and Angola.Serbia sold a majority stake in NIS to Gazprom in 2008 for 400 million euros ($470 million), with several billion invested since.NIS is currently 45 per cent owned by Gazprom Neft, which is under US sanctions, while the parent company, Gazprom, transferred its 11.3 per cent stake in September to its affiliated firm, Intelligence.The Serbian state owns nearly 30 percent, with the rest held by minority shareholders.

US stocks edged lower on Friday as a turbulent week marked by tariff threats and reversals headed toward a calmer finish, with investors turning cautious amid limited clarity on trade and geopolitical signals.In early trade, the S&P 500 slipped 0.1%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 258 points, or 0.5%, AP reported. The Nasdaq Composite was largely flat. Markets were on track to end a second straight week with modest losses after sharp swings earlier in the week.Sentiment remained guarded after US President Donald Trump said he had reached a “framework” with Nato on Greenland, even as details remained sparse and no agreement has been signed. Trump had earlier walked back tariff threats against several European allies, which had triggered heavy volatility earlier in the week.Stock-specific moves added to pressure. Intel tumbled sharply after issuing a weaker-than-expected forecast for the first quarter, citing supply constraints despite beating profit expectations. The stock’s slide weighed on broader technology sentiment.Bond and currency markets were relatively subdued compared to earlier turbulence.Long-term Japanese government bond yields eased after spiking to record levels earlier in the week, helping calm global markets. The 40-year Japanese bond yield slipped below 4% after breaching that mark previously.In Europe, markets were mixed in midday trade, with Germany’s DAX marginally higher while France’s CAC 40 slipped. Asian markets closed mostly higher, led by gains in Japan after the Bank of Japan held rates steady and slightly upgraded its outlook for inflation and growth.Commodities traded firmer. Gold rose 0.6% to around $4,945 an ounce, while silver jumped more than 3%, nearing the $100 level, reflecting continued safe-haven demand.

Under the new agreement, the short video platform will be operated through a majority American-owned joint venture.“I am so happy to have helped in saving TikTok! It will now be owned by a group of Great American Patriots and Investors, the Biggest in the World, and will be an important Voice,” Trump said. He also credited the app for boosting his appeal among younger voters, saying it “was responsible for my doing so well with the Youth Vote in the 2024 Presidential Election”.Trump further added, ""I only hope that long into the future I will be remembered by those who use and love TikTok."" He also thanked US vice president JD Vance and others in his administration who supported the agreement and also acknowledged Chinese President Xi Jinping for approving the arrangement, saying, “I would also like to thank President Xi, of China, for working with us and, ultimately, approving the Deal. He could have gone the other way, but didn’t, and is appreciated for his decision. ”Trump’s remarks came as TikTok confirmed it has finalised the formation of TikTok USDS Joint Venture LLC, a newly created entity intended to run its business in the United States and avoid a long-threatened ban linked to ByteDance’s Chinese ownership.Company said that the joint venture will cater to more than 200 million American users and about 7.5 million businesses. It will also operate with tighter safeguards around data protection, cybersecurity, content moderation, and the app’s recommendation algorithm.Under the ownership structure, US and international investors will jointly control 80.1% of the venture, while ByteDance will retain a 19.9% stake. Oracle, Silver Lake and Abu Dhabi-based MGX are among the biggest investors, each taking a 15 per cent share. Smaller stakes have been allotted to the Dell Family Office, Alpha Wave Partners, Revolution and NJJ Capital.The agreement follows several years of political and regulatory scrutiny in Washington. Pressure began mounting in 2020 when Trump sought to block the app over national security concerns. More recently, a law passed under former president Joe Biden required ByteDance to divest its US business or face a ban in TikTok’s largest market.TikTok said the US operation will function as an independent company guided by a seven-member board, with American directors forming the majority. Adam Presser has been appointed chief executive of the US business and will be responsible for securing US user data while driving growth across TikTok and its related apps.","US President Donald Trump, on Friday, hailed TikTok’s new deal and thanked Chinese President Xi Jinping for approving to ""save"" the platform.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Startups will play important role in helping India become 3rd largest economy: CEA Nageswaran,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/startups-will-play-important-role-in-helping-india-become-3rd-largest-economy-cea-nageswaran/articleshow/105332523.cms,"Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran





THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor (CEA) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran Udaan until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.Udaan built an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business still accounts for a very small part of India’s overall retail market but can balloon to $150 billion in sales and yield a 100% return on capital invested in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co. estimates published in the Mint newspaper.Bengaluru-based Udaan has also ventured into financing through its fintech unit which helps shopkeepers get working capital loans to buy inventory. That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says.

How India's GDP has been growing

What SBI report said on savings and investment

Incremental capital output ratio

NEW DELHI: India's gross domestic product (GDP) data for the third quarter (October-December 2022) received a word of caution from the former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan In an interview with news agency PTI, Rajan that India is ""dangerously close"" to the Hindu rate of growth in view of subdued private sector investment, high interest rates and slowing global growth.India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying"".However, a report released by the State Bank of India (SBI) economists on Tuesday dismissed arguments that India is dangerously close to Hindu rate of growth saying such statements are ""ill-conceived, biased and premature"".The term 'Hindu growth rate' was coined by late economist Raj Krishna in 1978 to describe the slow growth in the country.It basically refers to the low pace of economic growth rates during 1950s to 1980s. During this period, the Indian economy averaged 3.5%.A former lecturer at the Delhi School of Economics (DSE), Krishna noted that only if the rate of growth is persistently slow and accompanied by low per-capita GDP, then it will be known as Hindu rate of growth but it has to factor in population growth as well.Before economic reforms of 1991, India's economic growth remained stagnant and low, while per capita income averaged around 1.3%.Krishna termed this low growth situation to be a result of socialist policies of state control and import substitution.However, the economic situation changed when liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation (LPG) reforms came into effect in the year 1991, at a time when India faced balance of payment crisis.Over the years, many economists have strongly opposed the idea of 'Hindu growth rate' and the term never had universal acceptance.The Indian economy plunged into its very first technical recession in FY21 due to the impact of Covid-19 pandemic and the related nationwide lockdowns. GDP shrunk by an unprecedented 23.8% in the first quarter of the financial year 2020-21. However, due to spurt in economic activities in the subsequent quarters, the GDP decline started to narrow.However, if we look at the period before Covid-19 as well, India's growth curve shows a declining trend.From 8.26% in FY17, GDP growth plunged to 3.74% in FY20. Shutdown of economic activities in FY21 in wake of Covid-19 only made matters worse.As lockdowns started to ease and business activities resumed, India's GDP also started rising. In Q1 of FY22, growth jumped to 20.1% mainly on account of low base effect. By the fourth quarter of FY22, growth came down to 4.10%.Similarly, the new financial year 2022-23 brought fresh economic challenges in the form of Russia-Ukraine war that impacted almost all major economies of the world, slowed the pace of growth, pushed inflation to record highs.As a result, the central banks of all advanced economies spurred into action and opted for monetary policy tightening to curb the soaring inflation.With persistently rising interest rates, India's economy grew by 4.4% in Q3 of FY23, as the Centre revised upwards GDP growth for previous year to 9.10% from 8.7% earlier.The report weighed recent GDP numbers against the available data on savings and investments for the past decade and highlighted some interesting points.""Quarterly growth numbers are noisy and should be best avoided for any serious interpretation (on an average, India's GDP growth has witnessed Rs 2 lakh crore upward revision for the 3 year ended FY23),"" the report said.Gross capital formation (GCF) by the government touched a high of 11.8% in 2021-22, up from 10.7% in 2020-21.""This also had a domino effect on private sector investment that jumped from 10 per cent to 10.8% over the same period,"" it said.In fact, Ecowrap added that the trends in GCF to gross output ratio or the plough back of funds for creation of fresh capacity shows that for public administration the ratio attained fresh peak in 2021-22 owing to the emphasis on capital expenditure in recent budgets.At the aggregate level, gross capital formation is supposed to have crossed 32% in 2022-23, the highest level since 2018-19.According to the report, in 2021-22, gross savings have risen to 30% from 29% in 2020-21.""The ratio is supposed to have crossed 31 per cent in 2022-23, the highest since 2018-19. The household savings increased sharply during the pandemic period on account of sharp accretion in financial savings such as deposits,"" said the report by SBI's Economic Research Department.While household financial savings have since then moderated from 15.4% in 2020-21 to 11.1% in 2022-23, savings in physical assets have grown sharply to 11.8% in 2021-22 from 10.7% in 2020-21.The report further analysed Incremental Capital Output ratio (ICOR) -- which measures additional units of capital (investment) needed to produce additional units of output. It said that the ratio has been improving.""ICOR which was 7.5 in FY 12 is now only 3.5 in FY22. Clearly, only half of capital is now needed for next unit of output,"" the report noted.Such reducing ICOR in the current years reflects a relatively increasing efficiency of capital and shows that the economy is on a sound footing, the report said.""From that point of view, future GDP growth rates even at 7% could still mean a decent number by any standards!,"" it added.","India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.

An employee is entitled for a 50 per cent amount of the last drawn salary as pension.OPS was discontinued by the NDA government in 2003 with effect from April 1, 2004.Under the new pension scheme (NPS), employees contribute 10 per cent of their basic salary towards pension while the government contributes 14 per cent.Governments of Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand have informed the central government/ Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA about their decision to restart OPS for their employees.The government of Punjab on November 18, 2022, issued a notification regarding implementation of OPS for the state government employees who are being covered under NPS. Jharkhand too has decided to revert to OPS.",Former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan has expressed his concern over the decision of some states to restart the old pension scheme.

‘US Department of Justice has no business…’: Mark Mobius says US DOJ overstepped bounds on Adani case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/us-department-of-justice-has-no-business-mark-mobius-says-us-doj-overstepped-bounds-on-adani-case/articleshow/116127041.cms,"Mark Mobius said, “I think the Justice Department in the US probably overstepped its bounds. It has gone too far.”

Mark Mobius , Chairman of Mobius Emerging Opportunities Fund, has said that the US Department of Justice ‘overstepped its bounds’ in indicting Gautam Adani and other officials in the alleged bribery case. Mobius believes that the US Justice Department should not interfere with matters concerning an Indian company.In an interview with ET Now, Mark Mobius said, “ I think the Justice Department in the US probably overstepped its bounds. It has gone too far.”Mobius also anticipates a substantial reduction in the US Justice Department's international corporate prosecutions as Donald Trump assumes office in January. He emphasises the importance of examining tangible evidence rather than relying on hearsay in such cases. Regarding Adani, he advocates for a measured approach, suggesting a thorough review of evidence before making judgements.“...by the way, with the introduction of Trump, a lot of the work of the Justice Department going overseas to prosecute companies around the world is going to come down. They are going to be cutting that kind of work. The other thing, of course, is that we have to look at the evidence. Where is the evidence? And a lot of it is hearsay, but we have to look at the actual evidence. So, I would not condemn Adani immediately. I would first want to see evidence. And besides, the Justice Department in the US really has no business prosecuting an Indian company,” he was quoted as saying by ET.Also Read | ‘Investing in India is profitable’: Putin heaps praises on PM Modi; says Russia ready to set up manufacturing operations in India When questioned about the Adani Group stocks and whether he bought any when they crashed following the allegations, Mobius said, “I was looking at it, but it moved up too fast.”The Adani Group has approximately six listed companies, each operating in distinct sectors. These include Adani Enterprise, the primary holding company, and Adani Port, which manages port operations. The portfolio extends to the energy sector with Adani Green, whilst cement operations are handled through ACC and Ambuja.Asked about which Adani Group stock interests him, Mobius said, “Probably on the infrastructure side, because that is where they have an incredible expertise and global view. Power and infrastructure would probably be most interesting at this stage.""","Mark Mobius, Chairman of Mobius Emerging Opportunities Fund, has said that the US Department of Justice ‘overstepped its bounds’ in indicting Gautam Adani and other officials in the alleged bribery case.

Flipkart Marketplace Financials

Flipkart IPO : Flipkart, currently valued at $36 billion and recognised as India's premier ecommerce company, has set its sights on going public. The organisation is establishing a clear schedule of 12-15 months for its initial public offering (IPO), according to several individuals familiar with the plans. This forthcoming share issue, anticipated to be the largest by a new-economy company, represents a significant milestone for India's startup ecosystem, now ranked third globally.The company, under Walmart's ownership, has received internal clearance to shift its registration from Singapore to India, which is considered essential for the IPO process. Sources informed ET that the company aims to launch its public offering either by the end of next year or within 2026's first quarter.Flipkart IPO is likely to be the first among a group of approximately twelve new-age companies planning to enter the stock market in 2025. This follows the successful market entries of various consumer internet businesses, including Zomato, Nykaa and Swiggy, which have generated substantial interest among retail investors in Indian startups.The ecommerce leader has successfully secured nearly $1 billion in funding this year, with Google contributing $350 million. Although IPO discussions began in late 2021, they were temporarily suspended due to unfavourable market conditions during 2022-23.At Flipkart, under the leadership of group CEO Kalyan Krishnamurthy, the priority remains enhancing profitability whilst maintaining growth rates marginally above the industry standard.Walmart's October quarter earnings report highlighted Flipkart's impressive performance, noting double-digit growth during its signature Big Billion Days sale , which positively impacted Walmart's global revenue.Industry analysts have calculated that Indian ecommerce achieved Rs 1 lakh crore in gross sales during the festive period this year, with Flipkart retaining its market leadership position during this crucial season.Established in 2007 as an online bookstore, Flipkart's parent company is based in Singapore. This was a common practice among prominent startups of that era, who established holding companies overseas due to favourable funding conditions and regulatory frameworks.PhonePe, previously Singapore-based, relocated its domicile to India, resulting in $1 billion in tax benefits for the Indian government. Any potential merger between entities in India and Singapore would trigger tax implications. PhonePe completed its separation from Flipkart in late 2022, subsequently securing external funding from investors, including its primary stakeholder, Walmart.","Flipkart IPO is likely to be the first among a group of approximately twelve new-age companies planning to enter the stock market in 2025.

Should you replace old PAN with new PAN Card under PAN 2.0?

What are the benefits of PAN Card with QR Code?

Strengthened Security Features: The incorporation of QR code technology in the new PAN card significantly reduces vulnerability to duplication or alteration. The encrypted personal information within the QR code is accessible solely to authorised personnel with specific software. This security measure prevents fraudsters from modifying names and photographs whilst retaining the original PAN number. Financial institutions can utilise the QR code to authenticate the printed information. Efficient Authentication Process: Identity verification becomes streamlined through the QR code scanning feature on the updated PAN card. The immediate verification process serves as protection against identity theft and impersonation. This functionality proves particularly valuable during financial transactions by reducing errors and fraudulent activities. Current Information Maintenance: The upgraded PAN card ensures user details conform to the Income Tax Department's latest formatting requirements. Regulatory Adherence: Users who obtain the redesigned PAN card align with the government's updated identification protocols, supporting a more secure financial system. Fraud Prevention: The technical complexity involved in accurately reproducing QR codes creates a significant barrier for fraudsters attempting to duplicate PAN cards.

PAN 2.0: The Modi government has approved a new PAN 2.0 project and the first question that comes to the mind of taxpayers is, should they apply for the upgraded PAN Card under PAN 2.0? A free application option for a new PAN will be available for those needing to correct or update their details, such as name or date of birth.It’s important to note that the Income Tax Department has issued a statement confirming that current PAN cardholders need not mandatorily obtain a new PAN under the PAN 2.0 initiative.Experts are of the view that individuals holding older white PAN cards or PAN cards without QR codes should obtain the newer version featuring a QR code. Experts believe that the updated PAN card design with PAN 2.0 will reduce fraud risks through its integrated QR code whilst enabling quick verification.Also Read | PAN 2.0 for free! How to get PAN Card with QR code with address update online; step-by-step guide Vikram Babbar, Partner, EY Forensic & Integrity Services - Financial Services told ET, ""Upgrading to the new PAN card design with a QR code is a proactive step for users to safeguard their identity and financial information. It helps reduce the likelihood of falling prey to fraudulent activities.""Supporting this perspective, Ankit Ratan, CEO & Co-founder, Signzy - an online identity verification and customer onboarding company told ET, ""Under the PAN 2.0 initiative, the entire process of PAN application has been digitized. This enables provision of seamless PAN authentication and validation services to various organisations, including financial institutions, banks, and governmental bodies at both central and state levels.""Also Read | PAN 2.0 FAQs answered! Will your PAN Card change, will it have a new number? Income Tax Department releases top 10 points According to Babbar, the QR code integration with PAN Card offers several advantages to taxpayers:Ratan from Signzy, Ratan, explains that the new PAN card design incorporating a QR code represents a crucial advancement in fraud prevention and regulatory adherence. The QR code technology provides enhanced security and verification capabilities by storing encrypted information about the cardholder. The sophisticated encryption makes PAN card replication virtually impossible, as the QR code verification requires authorised software, confirming the card's authenticity and proper ownership, he says.A contrasting perspective comes from Sandeep Jhunjhunwala of Nangia Andersen LLP, who notes, ""Printed PAN cards carry QR code on them, now as well. Hence, while an upgrade to a new PAN card could be done anytime, it may not necessarily mean that under PAN 2.0 project, this would always protect the taxpayer against any potential fraud. The new system is expected to include features such as mandatory Aadhaar linkage, real-time validation and advanced data analytics, all of which could potentially help in identifying and preventing frauds. However, it remains unclear now as to how effectively these features would address the potential of fraud. As PAN 2.0 evolves, stakeholders could watch out for further updates from the authorities to understand how these features would be implemented and whether additional measures would be introduced to specifically tackle the menace of financial frauds.""","Experts are of the view that individuals holding older white PAN cards or PAN cards without QR codes should obtain the newer version featuring a QR code.

Macro matters

MUMBAI: RBI's incoming governor Sanjay Malhotra faces the challenge of balancing economic growth, inflation, and exchange rate stability - a battle that outgoing governor Shaktikanta Das was still fighting. At the same time, he has to deal with regulatory reforms affecting bank lending, curbing digital fraud, and addressing retail financial product mis-selling .The rupee has come under severe pressure following the US elections, with the dollar gaining strength and FPIs selling stocks. At the same time, senior ministers in govt have called for softer interest rates to support investments.For a central banker, the concept of the impossible trinity refers to the idea that they cannot pursue independent monetary policy, manage the exchange rate, and allow free flow of capital.Forex dealers said that the rupee had weakened in the non-deliverable forward market on Monday, which may result in a weak opening on Tuesday. While RBI is under pressure to cut rates in Feb given the slowdown in the economy in the second quarter, any pressure on the exchange rate would make this difficult.In a note released earlier this month, Rahul Bajoria, an economist with the Bank of America, highlighted RBI's ""three-body problem"" as it navigates slowing growth, elevated inflation, and exchange rate pressures.On the regulation side, Malhotra faces the challenge of implementing key regulatory changes. This includes requiring banks to make provisions for bad loans based on expected credit losses, which would hit their bottom line as well as their ability to lend in the short term but put them in a better position to deal with defaults in the future.RBI had also proposed to bring down bank exposure to project loans by requiring lenders to make hefty provisions for projects that do not get completed on time - thus completely discouraging banks from project loans. However, govt still sees a role for banks in funding investments by corporates.On the retail side, while the banking system has taken major steps on the digital front, a side effect has been a growing number of online frauds. While banking systems are secure, people are losing money to confidence tricksters who fool consumers into believing that they are remitting money to genuine billers or govt. The cyber cells of police authorities are overrun with complaints about digital fraud, and RBI is under pressure to curb these.Another issue on the retail side has been the misselling of insurance and other financial products by banks.","RBI's incoming governor Sanjay Malhotra faces the challenge of balancing economic growth, inflation, and exchange rate stability.

NEW DELHI: Revenue secretary Sanjay Malhotra 's sudden shift from Raisina Hill to Mumbai's Mint Road has created a crucial vacancy just seven weeks before FM Nirmala Sitharaman presents her eighth budget.While govt is yet to name Malhotra's successor, it's a job that requires some familiarity with complex tax matters, both direct and indirect. But it's a development that is not new to govt. In the past, the terms of finance secretaries ended weeks before the budget was presented and the Centre decided against giving an extension.The finance ministry has six secretaries - revenue, expenditure, economic affairs, financial services, DIPAM and public enterprises - but the first three are core to budget preparation along with the chief economic adviser, who writes the Economic Survey, and provides overall economic framework. The economic affairs department, where the budget division is housed, coordinates with other departments and ministries.In any case, this year the situation is already a little different, with DIPAM secretary Tuhin Kanta Pandey taking over as the finance secretary by virtue of his seniority after T V Somanathan was appointed cabinet secretary. Pandey is also in charge of the department of public enterprises (in addition to handling the department of personnel).For expenditure secretary Manoj Govil and financial services secretary M Nagaraju the current exercise will be their first experience with Union budgets. A new revenue secretary will have to hit the ground running, taking care of not just the budget proposals coming from all quarters but also ensuring that the CBDT and the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Excise are completely aligned with government's objectives.","The finance ministry has six secretaries - revenue, expenditure, economic affairs, financial services, DIPAM and public enterprises.

MUMBAI: The IT sector, which is on the path to recovery, is expected to witness a 15-20% growth in job opportunities across various industries in 2025, according to talent solutions company NLB Services .The IT industry has regained momentum in the second half of 2024 and is gearing up for a promising 2025 on multiple fronts, said NLB Services. In the coming year, fresher hiring in the Indian IT sector is poised for significant growth, with an anticipated increase of 15-20% in job opportunities across various industries, the company added.At the same time, the demand for highly specialised tech roles, including artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), data analytics, and cloud technologies, is expected to surge by 30-35%, driven by the increasing reliance on emerging technologies, it said.This surge in demand is not limited to hiring but extends to a strategic focus on tech upskilling, with companies investing heavily in training initiatives to equip their workforce with the necessary skills to meet the evolving technological landscape, the company noted.NLB Services' analysis is based on its view of the macro ecosystem, industry trends, and demand. Further, the company stated that campus hiring remains a core focus for larger companies that are looking to hire aggressively in the second half of 2024-25.Since the global economic slowdown of 2021-22, clients have curtailed discretionary spending due to on-demand hiring patterns and global macroeconomic challenges. This has impacted the project pipeline; however, it is expected to stabilize in 2025, offering fresh hopes for job seekers, it said.IT fresher hiring in 2025 is projected to increase, with high demand for roles in artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), data analytics, Python, cloud technologies, and cybersecurity. Sectors such as Global Capability Centres (GCCs), manufacturing, BFSI, healthcare, and retail are also anticipated to boost their IT fresher intake by 30-35% in 2025, it added.","The IT industry has regained momentum in the second half of 2024 and is gearing up for a promising 2025 on multiple fronts, says NLB Services.

Shaktikanta Das steered RBI with persuasive diplomacy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/shaktikanta-das-steered-rbi-with-persuasive-diplomacy/articleshow/116153425.cms,"Shaktikanta Das (File photo)

MUMBAI: One of the biggest validations for RBI governor Shaktikanta Das came towards the end of his tenure. Both the commerce and finance ministers criticised RBI's decision to maintain higher interest rates for an extended period.Their statements - far from being laudatory - highlighted RBI's robustness as an institution in being capable of resisting govt excesses. The ministers' criticism of Das dispels most of the concerns raised when he took charge about RBI's ability to take an independent stand.In 2018, Das had succeeded Urjit Patel, whose tumultuous and transformative tenure was marked by demonetisation, a new monetary policy framework, bankruptcy reforms, and lending restrictions on public sector banks. Back then, Patel had resigned amid tensions between RBI and the finance ministry, with govt seeking greater control over governance of the central bank. Being govt's representative for demonetisation and succeeding Patel, Das was initially seen as aligned with govt.He began his tenure by rebuilding bridges within RBI and adopting a consultative approach. By ensuring clear communication across multiple channels, including speeches, interactions with bankers as well as research publications, he left no room for confusion. His speeches often ended with a quote from Mahatma Gandhi, while his policy statements frequently referenced ""Arjuna's eye"" - symbolising RBI's unwavering focus on inflation.In regulation, RBI adopted a strategy of pre-emptive strikes through business restrictions rather than just warnings. Major institutions such as HDFC Bank, Bajaj Finance, and Bank of Baroda faced business restrictions for transgressions - a strategy that seems to have yielded results. Under Das, RBI also controlled financial markets with an iron hand, leading the IMF to classify India's FX market as a ""managed float"" rather than market-determined.Das's strength lies in implementing key reforms subtly, as seen in his handling of the largest cooperative bank collapse and the failure of Yes Bank a year into his tenure. Breaking from tradition, where public sector banks bailed out failed entities using taxpayer money, he facilitated private-sector-led rescue packages, avoiding any burden on public funds.During the pandemic, while global regulators pushed for freezing borrower liabilities, RBI offered support worth several lakh crore rupees as soft loans with a sunset clause, avoiding outright giveaways. Das's effective coordination between RBI's monetary policy and the Centre's fiscal policy played a key role.In many areas, the perception of the Modi govt is that it pushes reforms aggressively, aided by its parliamentary majority. While this works well for infrastructure projects, banking and finance require a different approach. Acting too forcefully can undermine reforms' successful implementation. In a country where reforms have historically been implemented in times of crisis and through stealth, Das's method of persuasive diplomacy and strategic subtlety stands out.","Shaktikanta Das succeeded Urjit Patel, whose tenure was marked by demonetisation, a new monetary policy framework, bankruptcy reforms, and lending restrictions on public sector banks.

Revenue secretary Sanjay Malhotra to be next RBI governor,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/revenue-secretary-sanjay-malhotra-to-be-next-rbi-governor/articleshow/116149675.cms,"Revenue secretary Sanjay Malhotra (File photo)

NEW DELHI: Government on Monday sprung a surprise by naming revenue secretary Sanjay Malhotra , 56, as the 26th Reserve Bank of India governor to replace Shaktikanta Das , whose six-year stint on Mumbai's Mint Road ends on Tuesday.After weeks of suspense, the appointments committee of cabinet zeroed in on Malhotra hours before Das's tenure was to end. Like his predecessors, Malhotra has been given a 3-year term starting Dec 11.The appointment was a surprise for Malhotra himself and he was said to be coming to grips with the development as he left North Block on Monday evening.IAS topper from 1990 batch, Malhotra - who has been poring over Budget proposals and preparing for the crucial GST Council meeting later this month - will leave IAS more than three years before his age of retirement to take up one of the most powerful jobs in the country.Malhotra is a computer science graduate from IIT Kanpur and has a master's from Princeton University.Hailing from Bikaner, Malhotra will be the third IITian, after Raghuram Rajan (IIT Delhi) and D Subbarao (IIT Kharagpur) to occupy the crucial 18th floor office in RBI, and also the second Malhotra - after R N Malhotra (1985 to 1990) - to lead the regulatory agency.But the similarities end there. In opting for Malhotra, the Modi govt has signalled its preference for a civil servant to run Reserve Bank after Das, also from IAS, ensured smooth coordination with Centre, ending years of tussle between the finance ministry and the central bank over multiple issues - from the trajectory of interest rates to managing govt borrowings, the formula for paying dividends and recognising bad debts of banks.While Malhotra has been dealing with Centre's revenues ever since he moved to North Block in Oct 2022, he is no stranger to financial services. Between Feb and Oct 2022, he was secretary in the department of financial services, overseeing state-owned banks and insurance companies..During this period, he was also the government's nominee on RBI’s central board. Before that, he spent two years as the chairman and managing director of REC, the state-run infrastructure finance company. Malhotra came into his own when he shifted to the revenue department.The low-profile bureaucrat has an eye for detail, which officials said was visible during the pre-Budget meetings when he would take up issues related to tax returns with the direct and indirect tax brass. “He knows the details himself, so it is difficult to bluff him. Although he is soft-spoken, he can be assertive,” said an officer, who has attended several of his meetings.Another officer said that he would even bring up latest court rulings during his meetings with revenue officials, asking them to factor those in. “He has a good sense of how the economy will respond to a certain proposals and quickly understands the requirements of the job,” the official said, adding that the way Malhotra led the entire Financial Action Task Force (FATF) review also worked in his favour as India came out as one of the top performers.Always smartly turned out, Malhotra invariably engages attention with his colourful ties that are well coordinated with his suits, He enjoys the trust of finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman who often turns to him for technical input in complicated tax matters.Whether it was dealing with tax deduction on virtual digital assets or the revamped capital gains regime, the Rajasthan-cadre officer was willing to tackle issues even when public opinion did not favour the proposals. He was equally at ease dealing with GST issues: a vexed subject requiring striking a fine balance with the competing demands of states.","Malhotra is a computer science graduate from IIT Kanpur and has a master's from Princeton University.

NEW DELHI: Over 40 private schools in Delhi received bomb threats via email on Sunday night at 11.38 pm. Among these, five schools that received these threats are Delhi Public School in Vasant Kunj and in R.K. Puram, G.D. Goenka School and Doon Public School in Paschim Vihar, and Brilliant's Convent School in Pitampura.An official said calls of bomb threats were received from DPS RK Puram at 7.06 am and GD Goenka Paschim Vihar at 6.15 am.A team from the Delhi Fire Services (DFS) immediately reached the spot. The police, bomb disposal squad, and dog squad, along with DFS personnel, are checking the entire premises of the school.As of now, nothing suspicious has been found, a police official said.The schools were targeted in a threatening email, which claimed that hidden bombs were planted within the premises. The email asserted that multiple bombs were strategically placed inside the building, posing a significant threat to the students and staff.The anonymous sender demanded a ransom of $30,000, warning that failure to comply would result in the detonation of the bombs. The school administration took immediate action, sending students back home who came to attend classes. Parents were asked to pick up their children as a precautionary measure.""I planted multiple bombs inside the building. The bombs are small and hidden very well. It will not cause very much damage to the building, but many people will be injured when the bombs detonate. You all deserve to suffer and lose limbs. If I do not receive $30,000 I will detonate the bombs,"" the email read.Most schools that received the threat suspended their classes and sent students back home as officials said. Further checking was underway.Earlier on November 19, the Delhi high court directed the local government and police to create a thorough action plan, including a detailed Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for handling bomb threats and similar emergencies. The authorities were given eight weeks to complete these instructions.The Court specified that the SOP should clearly outline the duties of all involved parties--law enforcement, school management, and municipal authorities--to ensure seamless coordination and implementation.Justice Sanjeev Narula's bench, responding to an application by Advocate Arpit Bhargava, instructed the Delhi Government and Police to complete a comprehensive action plan, including an SOP for managing bomb threats and related emergencies.The action plan must be developed in consultation with relevant stakeholders, including school representatives, law enforcement agencies, municipal authorities, and other state departments.Meanwhile, Delhi chief minister Atishi attacked the Central government and said that the BJP-ruled central government has failed in its only task of providing security.""After the daily incidents of ransom, murders, firing in Delhi, now threats of bombing of schools are being received. The law and order situation in Delhi has never been so bad before.

Is Nissan's decline inevitable? Honda merger talks could hold key to survival,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/is-nissans-decline-inevitable-honda-merger-talks-could-hold-key-to-survival/articleshow/116148355.cms,"Representative image (Picture credit: AP)

Is a Honda merger the answer?

Nissan is grappling with a severe financial crisis that could lead to bankruptcy within the next 12 to 14 months unless decisive action is taken. The company, once a leader in the automotive industry, is now in its worst position since Carlos Ghosn's dramatic efforts in 1999 to pull it from the brink of collapse.With profits plunging by 70 per cent and a recent $60 million loss, Nissan is scrambling to find a solution to its mounting troubles, reported Forbes.In an attempt to salvage its future, Nissan has outlined a major restructuring plan, targeting $3 billion in savings.This includes slashing 9,000 jobs globally and selling a significant portion of its stake in Mitsubishi Motors . The company is also cutting production by 20 per cent at key US facilities in Canton, Mississippi, and Smyrna, Tennessee, which together employ over 13,000 workers.In a rare move, CEO Makoto Uchida has taken a 50 per cent pay cut to signal the urgency of the situation.Nissan’s woes can largely be attributed to its struggle to adapt to the rapidly changing automotive landscape.The company’s electric vehicle lineup is minimal, with only two models available internationally, while cheaper Chinese EV alternatives are flooding the market. Despite these challenges, there are bright spots.In the US, the locally-built Rogue SUV remains a top performer, having sold over 189,000 units through September 2024. Similarly, the Qashqai continues to dominate in Europe.However, these successes are not enough to counteract the broader decline, as per Forbes.Nissan is now searching for a lifeline, and a potential merger with Honda could be the key to its survival. The two companies recently signed a partnership focused on electric vehicle development , and some industry experts are speculating that a merger could help combine resources to overcome current financial struggles.According to the Financial Times, while this idea remains speculative, it could provide Nissan with the strength it needs to compete in the increasingly competitive global automotive market.Nissan’s future remains uncertain, and time is running out. The company must make bold decisions, such as finding a major investor or merging with Honda if it hopes to avoid the fate of bankruptcy.","Nissan has outlined a major restructuring plan, targeting $3 billion in savings.

TSMC rules

Trump tariffs

As South Korea descends into political chaos, its equity market risks falling further behind major tech rival Taiwan, which is basking in the glory of the global artificial intelligence boom.A near 30% surge in Taiwan’s stock benchmark this year, set to be the best since 2009, has already helped spur a historic divergence between Asia’s two tech-dominated markets. The island’s market capitalization now exceeds South Korea’s by about $950 billion as the world’s AI frontrunners from Nvidia Corp. and Microsoft Corp. to OpenAI all increasingly turn to Taiwanese firms for supply.Looking ahead to next year, while both export-oriented economies face the risk of higher tariffs by incoming US President Donald Trump, many investors see Taiwan as less vulnerable given the reliance of American firms on its technology as well as its relatively better economic prospects.Such optimism, and a recent pickup in inflows into local stocks, also augur well for the Taiwanese dollar, which has fared better than the Korean won in 2024.“The structural theme of AI is likely to only get extended further, and this means we could see another year of Taiwan outperformance,” said Charu Chanana, chief investment strategist at Saxo Markets in Singapore. “The Korea discount may linger for longer given the recent political debacle, and the corporate governance reforms will have to be prioritized to get any closer to erasing this discount.”South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol is fighting for his political life after his attempt to break an impasse in parliament by briefly imposing martial law backfired. The turmoil has cast a pall over the nation’s outlook and it also may impact the Corporate Value-Up program much touted by Yoon as a way to boost shareholder returns and eradicate the so-called Korea Discount, a term referring to the long depressed valuations of the country’s equities.Down more than 8% this year, the Kospi is one of the world’s worst-performing major equity indexes. Its underperformance versus Taiwan’s Taiex has deepened further this month.Taiwan’s equity-market outperformance has a lot to do with this year’s 80% surge in the shares of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the world’s top advanced chipmaker that accounts for 37% of the benchmark’s weighting. The company is the major supplier of Nvidia and Apple Inc.’s most advanced chips.In contrast, shares of Samsung Electronics Co. — South Korea’s most-valued company — have been the biggest drag on its local market. Samsung’s stock has slumped 31% in Seoul this year on concerns that the firm is missing out on the AI boom due to slow progress on technological breakthroughs and lingering management woes.Overall, Taiwan’s exposure to AI goes far beyond TSMC: over 40 AI-related firms constitute about 73% of MSCI Taiwan’s index weighting, according to Goldman Sachs Group analysts. At 33%, Korea is a distant second in Asia and features SK Hynix Inc. and Samsung Electronics only.Analysts’ average earnings per share estimate for MSCI Taiwan has risen more than 33% this year to a record high, while that for MSCI Korea has declined 5% since a peak in August, Bloomberg compiled data shows.“If you think of Nvidia’s AI server market and so on, Taiwan is heavily involved in that value chain,” said Yan Taw Boon, portfolio manager at Neuberger Berman. “Conversely, Korea has not performed as strongly as they have very little involvement in this new booming environment.”While the higher tariffs threatened by Trump are a universal challenge, there are reasons some investors believe that Taiwan’s treatment may be more nuanced and less punishing.“One will recall that many Taiwanese exports were exempt from tariffs last time around as they were key components of US tech supply chains,” JPMorgan Chase & Co. analysts including Rajiv Batra wrote in a note. “This time is likely to be the same with TSMC seen as a major part of the Global AI trade.”The Wall Street bank sees Taiwan relatively better positioned than Korea in a trade war with the US.Another buffer for Taiwanese equities is the growing presence of local investors, especially when the global investment climate turns more capricious.“Taiwan retail investors’ home bias and the still interesting AI ramp-up theme should continue to drive participation in the stock market,” said Vivian Pai, fund manager at Fidelity International. Their increased awareness of long-term investing can help form strong consistent inflows into local stocks, she added.The Taiwan dollar has weakened about 5% against the US currency this year while the Korean won has fallen around 9%.“Both Taiwan and Korea are exposed to tariffs but Taiwan’s underlying economic fundamentals are more solid,” said Eddie Cheung, a strategist at Credit Agricole CIB. “This should persist in 2025.”",Taiwan's market capitalization now exceeds South Korea's by about $950 billion.

There’s no doubt that cryptocurrencies remain highly volatile assets. Investors seek high-yield projects, and while Ripple leads in cross-border blockchain transactions, a new contender is emerging. Rexas Finance (RXS) has a big vision of Real World Asset (RWA) tokenisation. By integrating traditional assets with blockchain technology, Rexas Finance creates opportunities for investors to penetrate high-value markets that have been hard to navigate, such as real estate and art. This analysis reviews the possibility of RXS replicating Ripple’s steps to the $2.5 mark and whether it would attract investors during the process.Ripple's popularity stems from its fast, low-cost global payment platform. Currently priced at $2.33, XRP boasts a market capitalisation of $133.6 billion, reflecting strong investor confidence. The coin is still dominant despite its prominent issues with SEC accusations of the company. RippleNet, the company's payment network, gained the confidence of many banks and financial institutions. This reinforces expectations for the future of XRP quite a lot. The investors’ mood is quite optimistic as many think of a positive outcome of the ongoing SEC case, which is likely to create new highs for XRP. Some analysts predict that the price might rise to around $3 only in the short term, while $5 is possible but only if Ripple can penetrate many institutional on-boards and acquire new customers throughout the industry. XRP provides steady growth, but other newer projects, such as Rexas Finance (RXS), which is focused on real-world asset tokenisation and other latest trends within the blockchain industry, are perceived to present opportunities for higher exponential returns.Unlike Ripple, Rexas Finance is focused on revolutionising the investment landscape by bridging conventional assets with blockchain technology. The project enables fractional ownership of high-value assets like real estate, gold, and art, broadening access for more investors. The presale has raised $21 million, selling 292 million RXS tokens out of a total supply of 1 billion. The current Stage 9 presale price of $0.125 marks a significant increase from the initial $0.030 price, reflecting a 320% surge. The next presale stage will sell for $0.15, with substantial growth potential after that. Rexas Finance’s decision to bypass venture capital funding and adopt a community-driven presale model has been a strategic success. This inclusive approach aligns with blockchain’s decentraliz\sation principles, fostering trust and loyalty among early investors.Rexas Finance’s selling point hits the point, showing how they can gain access to huge markets through tokenisation. The real estate industry is said to have a market worth around $379.7 trillion; when it comes to gold or other commodities, the entire segment is valued at $121.2 trillion. There is also room for expansion in the $65 billion annual revenue art market. Rexas Finance unlocks investment opportunities in high-value assets by tokenizing them, making it possible for people to invest in expensive properties and commodities without the usual constraints of high capital requirements. Users of Rexas Token Builder and Launchpad, among other of the platform’s tools, can develop their own tokenised assets and invest in fractionalized shares of luxury objects. This advancement makes it easier for people to hold assets while increasing security, transparency, and reach to users worldwide.Rexas Finance's presale performance, coupled with innovation in the business model, is why it can reach the $2.5 mark after launch. Since the token price is $0.125, this is a win-win situation for early investors who hope to get better rates before the token gets primary exchange listings in early 2025. Another factor that allowed the platform to attract a more extensive investor base is its listing on the CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko platforms. In addition, the $1 million giveaway, promising 20 prizes of 50,000 RXS tokens, generated a lot of buzz and engagement. Hitting the $2.5 target is not just wishful thinking. The combination of Rexas Finance’s existing and future focus on tokenizing global real-world assets and the community-building element will ensure explosive growth. As more and more people use Rexas Finance, and if the platform's innovation trend continues, the $2.5 mark is very much attainable.The price of Ripple (XRP) remains fairly stable for investing purposes, with its offerings revolving around the payments and remittance sector. For investors who want to take on a higher risk and expect better returns, there is Rexas Finance (RXS), which appears worth looking into. The token aims to leverage the growing market of tokenized real-world assets at a community level. It has been focused heavily on its pre-sale activities, giving it much room for growth. Rexas Finance is an exciting investment. It is currently priced at $0.125, but estimates project it to reach $2.5 post-launch. For those wishing to take advantage of the potential within blockchain technology these days, Rexas Finance cannot be overlooked.For more information about Rexas Finance (RXS) visit the links below:Website: https://rexas.com Whitepaper: https://rexas.com/rexas-whitepaper.pdf Twitter/X: https://x.com/rexasfinance Telegram: https://t.me/rexasfinance","Rexas Finance (RXS) has a big vision of Real World Asset (RWA) tokenisation.

President-elect Donald Trump’s pick of a crypto proponent to be the next head of the US securities regulator lifted Bitcoin to $100,000 for the first time as traders warmed to the prospect of relaxed regulations.The digital asset rose as much as 6.1% to $103,801 on Thursday before changing hands at $101,968 as of 6:45 am in London. The crypto market overall has jumped by roughly $1.3 trillion since Trump’s election victory on Nov 5 on a platform that includes a tight embrace of the crypto sector.Trump selected Paul Atkins to replace outgoing Securities & Exchange Commission chair Gary Gensler, who cracked down on digital assets after a 2022 market rout exposed fraudulent practices and sparked costly blowups.“This is a momentum rally,” said Jason Titman, CEO, crypto brokerage Swyftx. “Global spot volumes are above mid-pandemic levels and nomination of Paul Atkins as SEC chair just added to the carnival atmosphere.”On November 22, Bitcoin was less than $300 from achie ving $100,000 but fell back while remaining in sight of the landmark level. Crypto’s adherents view the six-figure number as a validation of controversial claims that Bitcoin is a modern-day store of value and a hedge for inflation risk. For critics, the digital asset lacks any fundamental value and is too exposed to speculative whims.Hitting $100,000 is “a huge milestone for token and crypto industry as a whole,” said Caroline Mauron, co-founder of Orbit Markets, a provider of liquidity for crypto derivatives. “We expect further momentum for the coming days.”US exchange-traded funds for Bitcoin have attrac ted a net inflow of about $32 billion this year, including over $8 billion since Trump became president-elect, data compiled by Bloomberg sho wed. The combined trading volume for digital assets and related derivatives across centralised exchanges climbed to a record of more than $10 trillion last month, according to CCData.Trump has vowed to undo a Biden administration clampdown on digital assets, install friendly regulators and turn the US into global home of crypto. The Republican even backed idea of strategic national Bitcoin reserve, though there are doubts over whether the latter objective is feasible.","The digital asset rose as much as 6.1% to $103,801 on Thursday before changing hands at $101,968 as of 6:45 am in London.

Another BTC rally is coming, and the meme coin market is already stealing headlines. The latest meme coin in the spotlight is Catslap .The project’s quirky narrative is centred around a feisty feline that slaps anything that gets in its way. The token exploded 1800% on its Uniswap launch , but its market cap is still incredibly low.Could SLAP be the next meme coin to explode? Catslap ($SLAP) introduces a slap-to-earn model that allows investors to earn crypto rewards by slapping their favourite memes. The more they slap, the more they earn, and the more the project burns.As the Slapometer count increases, so does the number of tokens burnt. The reward model has country and user leaderboards.Catslap was launched directly on Uniswap without any presales. The fair launch lays a level playing field for new investors.Aggressive marketing campaigns will go live over the coming weeks to strengthen the community. For those seeking a high-risk, high-reward opportunity, Catslap is a meme coin to watch out now. The $SLAP community has exploded to around 10,000 members onWith the dog coin niche saturated, investors have turned their attention to cat coins. According to CoinMarketCap, cat coins have a total market cap of under $5 billion now. That is incredibly low when compared to dog coins, which boast a market cap of close to $90 billion.The difference underscores the growth potential of the cat coin niche. It is taking off as Popcat (SOL) and Mog Coin (MOG) top the hot lists. For example, Popcat has exploded close to 8000% in a year, while MOG recorded 9000% gains.The problem, however, is that these cat coins are close to hitting their saturation points. MOG is closing in on a $1 billion market cap, and Popcat has already smashed it.Even if they dominate the niche, they don’t have much room left for growth. Not for multifold, explosive price surges.This is where new projects like Catslap enter the picture. Due to their low initial market caps, they are capable of turbocharged surges.For a better context, Catslap’s market cap is just around $10 million now. If it jumps over $100 million, it could yield close to 1000% returns for early investors. For Popcat to deliver similar gains, it would need to cross a staggering $10 billion market cap. Even large meme coins like Pepe hover under the $10 billion point.Catslap just burnt 25 million tokens as part of strengthening its price momentum. Token burns are commonly used in the crypto space to drive a token’s value. They cut down the permanent supply, which, in turn, could positively affect the price.SLAP is an Ethereum-based meme coin. The SLAP tokenomics solidifies the project’s commitment to long-term growth and sustainability.The $SLAP tokenomics focuses on stable and community-driven growth. It gives Catslap an edge over its cat coin competitors.Crypto influencer Austin Hilton, who commands a YouTube community of over 280,000 members, recently featured the project on his channel. He drew attention to the project’s growth potential as a new contender in the cat coin space.The meme coin community is ready to embrace another bull season. Catslap is positioned to pounce on the opportunity. It is too early to tell whether it can replicate the success of Popcat and Mogcoin.Catslap is available for purchase on decentralised exchanges like Uniswap. Investors can also purchase the token directly through Best Wallet, the popular non-custodial wallet. Both crypto and fiat payments are accepted.The token has undergone a security audit by Solidproof to mitigate risks of hacks and theft. $SLAP is live on both Dex Screener and DexTools.*You must be at least 18 years old to access this site.","Catslap ($SLAP) introduces a slap-to-earn model that allows investors to earn crypto rewards by slapping their favourite memes.

"Airbus cuts over 2,000 jobs amidst competition from Elon Musk's Starlink",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/airbus-cuts-over-2000-jobs-amidst-competition-from-elon-musks-starlink/articleshow/116002827.cms,"Germany will shoulder the primary burden of workforce reductions with 689 positions.

Airbus job cuts : Airbus has announced approximately 2,000 job cuts in its Defence and Space division, representing 5% of its second-largest unit. The company faces challenges from American competition in satellites, though the job cuts were less extensive than initially indicated by the company.European satellite manufacturers, traditionally specialising in sophisticated geostationary spacecraft, have struggled against the emergence of cost-effective small satellites in low Earth orbit, particularly due to the rapid expansion of "" Elon Musk 's Starlink constellation"".The Space Systems business will bear the majority of the 2,043 position cuts, with 1,128 roles affected following significant satellite-related losses. The European aerospace organisation confirmed there would be no forced redundancies.Germany will shoulder the primary burden of workforce reductions with 689 positions, whilst France faces 540 cuts, Britain 477, Spain 303, and other peripheral nations 34, according to a Reuters report.The establishment of Airbus by these four nations over five decades ago makes the distribution of workforce reductions a delicate political matter.France hosts Airbus's main headquarters and primary jetliner production, whilst Germany oversees defence and space operations. Spain manages military transport aircraft assembly, and Britain specialises in satellite payloads and communications systems.Airbus, which manufactures satellites, transporters and holds significant stakes in European missile, fighter and space-launch initiatives, issued a statement after Reuters disclosed the job cuts during union briefings regarding an efficiency assessment.Following October's announcement of potential cuts of up to 2,500 positions (7% of workforce) due to €1.5 billion in satellite-related writedowns, particularly affecting OneSat, Airbus has now detailed specific reductions: 250 positions in Air Power, 47 in Connected Intelligence, and 618 posts at divisional headquarters.These reductions are distinct from "" Project Bromo "", a proposed merger of Airbus, Thales and Leonardo's satellite operations to enhance competitiveness against Starlink. Both initiatives reflect efforts to strengthen Europe's space sector against mounting competition.The implementation of these job cuts, scheduled for completion by mid-2026, primarily targets administrative and management positions rather than operational roles, focusing on reducing overhead and fixed expenses.The governments of the founding nations, including France and Germany each holding 11% ownership, have received briefings about these reductions, which form part of the Proton reorganisation initiative.The proposed staff reductions constitute roughly 5% of the division's workforce, according to Airbus. This percentage suggests a slight increase in divisional staff numbers this year, as the cuts represent 6% of the reported workforce at end-2023.France's Thales, which maintains two collaborative ventures with Italy's Leonardo in satellites and services, is currently discussing plans with unions regarding 1,300 space-related position reductions.","Airbus has announced approximately 2,000 job cuts in its Defence and Space division, representing 5% of its second-largest unit.

"Afghan economy shows modest signs of growth but recovery remains fragile, says World Bank",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/afghan-economy-shows-modest-signs-of-growth-but-recovery-remains-fragile-says-world-bank/articleshow/115998852.cms,"Image credit: AP

Afghanistan's economy is showing modest signs of growth after two years of severe contraction, the World Bank said.In its latest development update issued late Wednesday, the financial institution said modest GDP growth of 2.7% was driven by private consumption. The partial recovery, coupled with falling food prices, helped to gradually improve household welfare.Before the Taliban returned to power in August 2021, Afghanistan's economy relied heavily on foreign aid and corruption was rife. Their takeover three years ago sent the economy into a tailspin, as billions in international funds were frozen, and tens of thousands of highly skilled Afghans fled the country and took their money with them.Afghan's exports remained stable in 2023-24 but imports surged, creating a widening trade deficit, according to the World Bank. This deficit, exacerbated by dependence on imports for essential goods like fuel, food and machinery, could pose a risk to the country's economic stability.Faris Hadad-Zervos, the World Bank's country director for Afghanistan, said long-term growth prospects required tapping into the substantial potential of the domestic private sector and improving the overall business environment.""Key to this is increased investment, providing access to finance to small businesses, and supporting educated and skilled women entrepreneurs so their businesses can thrive,"" said Hadad-Zervos. ""Without this, the country risks prolonged stagnation with limited prospects for sustainable development.""The update comes days after media reports that the Taliban have ordered educational institutions to stop providing medical training to women and girls. The Taliban have neither confirmed the order nor responded to the reports.On Thursday, the head of the UN children's agency Unicef said she was deeply alarmed by the reported restrictions.Unicef was determining the veracity of these differing accounts and welcomed efforts to address the issue, said the agency's executive director Catherine Russell.If confirmed, this ban was expected to immediately halt the medical education of thousands of women and jeopardize women and girls' access to health care, she added.""It would not only further limit the ability of women to contribute to society and earn an income but would also have far-reaching consequences for the health of the Afghan population. Lives would be lost,"" she warned.","Afghanistan's economy is showing modest signs of growth after two years of contraction.

However, China's share in Pakistan's total external debt went down to 22 per cent compared to 25 per cent in 2023 with Saudi Arabia increasing its share from 2 per cent in 2023 to 7 per cent in 2024.The World Bank's International Debt Report 2024 released on Tuesday ranks Pakistan among the top three loan recipients from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) this year and also notes that Pakistan's high debt-to-export and debt-to-revenue ratios indicate a weakening fiscal position.The International Debt Report 2024 put Pakistan's total external debt (including that from IMF) at $ 130.85 billion in 2023, accounting for 352 per cent of its total exports and 39 per cent of gross national income (GNI) while Pakistan's total external debt servicing amounted to 43 per cent of total exports and 5 per cent of GNI.As per the 2023 edition of the report, Pakistan's total external debt (including that from IMF) was at $ 126.95 billion in 2023, accounting for 320 per cent of its total exports and 34 per cent of gross national income (GNI) while Pakistan's total external debt servicing amounted to 42 per cent of total exports and 4 per cent of GNI.According to the 2024 report, China had the single largest share of debt to Pakistan at 22 per cent share (about $ 28.786 billion), followed by World Bank's 18 per cent share ($ 23.55 billion) and Asian Development Bank's 15 per cent share ($ 19.63 billion).Saudi Arabia stood out as the second largest bilateral lender to Pakistan with 7 per cent of total debt or about $ 9.16 billion.Of the total external debt stock, about 45 per cent debt ($ 58.88 billion) belonged to the bilateral lenders and 46 per cent (about $ 60.2 billion) to multilaterals, while remaining 9 per cent debt belonged to private lenders led by bondholders with 8 per cent chunk, the 2024 report said.It further noted that of the total $ 130.85 bn, long-term external debt stocks stood at $ 110.44 billion; $ 11.53 billion was IMF credit and allocations and $ 8.878 billion was short-term external debt.According to newspaper Dawn, the financial strain was fiercest for the poorest and most vulnerable countries - those eligible to borrow from the World Bank's International Development Association (IDA). These countries paid a record $ 96.2 billion to service their debt in 2023, the data showed.For some countries, the payments run as high as 38 per cent of export earnings but Pakistan even surpassed this landmark as its interest payments stood at 43 per cent of exports, it said, adding, Pakistan made the second-largest interest payments in South Asia while the interest payment by Bangladesh and India increased by more than 90 per cent in 2023, highest in the region.In September, Minister of State for Finance Ali Pervaiz Malik told a meeting of the National Assembly Standing Committee that Pakistan was facing a daunting task of repaying a staggering $ 100 billion external debt over the next four years, an amount which is nearly 10 times its current $ 9.4 billion foreign exchange reserves.The $ 100 billion external debt repayments from 2024 to 2027 are exclusive of any payments on account of the liabilities booked at the balance sheet of the central bank and the requirements for financing the current account deficitMeanwhile, the Pakistan government on Monday admitted that there are ""hiccups"" in implementing the IMF programme, but asserted its commitment to completing the $ 7 billion package.",World Bank's International Debt Report 2024 ranks Pakistan among the top three loan recipients from the International Monetary Fund.

As crypto is firmly in bull market territory, now is the time to stack up on altcoins. A new project, Cutoshi, currently in presale, is gaining a lot of traction.Bitcoin has essentially been adopted by mainstream finance, meaning that it will not go to 0, despite the 477 ‘Bitcoin obituaries’ in the past. Many ‘experts’ are now publishing articles about why they were wrong about BTC.As long as the bull market continues, BTC should keep going up, but it will be outperformed by many smaller-cap coins.Considering that Ethereum, like Bitcoin, has had a Spot ETF, the price action this year has been disappointing. As Bitcoin makes all-time highs, ETH is struggling to get close to its ATH of $4,878, and is currently trading at around $3,451.According to DeFiLlama, over 63% of all decentralized finance and money locked (TVL) is stored on Ethereum. Many Layer 2 blockchains are built upon it that use ETH as a gas token, such as Arbitrum.With the new pro-crypto administration coming in, it looks as though the issue of ETH being a potential security is over. Another benefit is that ETH staking rewards can potentially be integrated into the ETF returns, making Ethereum Spot ETFs more attractive for institutional investors.Known as the Ethereum killer, Solana is considered to be Etheruem’s rival. It’s built with a different coding language and offers fast speeds and low fees. Solana became the chain of choice for many meme coins since the launch of the easy-to-use meme coin deployer Pump.fun.Solana is likely to be the next coin to receive a Spot ETF, with applications from asset managers Bitwise, VanEck, 21Shares and Canary Capital.If Solana can grow as big as ETH is now, then that's room for 3.74x growth, as we can see from the picture below:Image from MarketCapOf If Solana grows as big as ETH did in the last bull run, that's a SOL price of $1,205.26 (5.15x).While the previous coins are the three biggest in all crypto, in terms of market cap and overall adoption, every portfolio, especially a crypto one, needs a small-cap coin with a lot of potential.Cutoshi is a cat-based meme coin with a devoted community. Cutoshi is also a DeFi ecosystem in the making, giving it long-term use cases and functionality. Currently building a P2P and cross-chain DEX to make DeFi more simple, teaching people how to use DeFi through a fun learning space and offering people the ability to do yield farming and more.Cutoshi is in the third stage of its presale, soon to move to stage four, with over $1.1 million raised already.To put the opportunity in context, let's compare it to one of the most successful memecoins that also does DeFi - Shiba Inu.Image from MarketCapOf As we can see, if CUTO can reach the size of SHIB, that’s an amazing 1271.35x. CUTO, which is currently on sale for $0.0259, could be worth close to $33 dollars in the long term.For more information on the Cutoshi (CUTO) Presale:Email: alex@cutoshi.com Join and become a community member:","As crypto is firmly in bull market territory, now is the time to stack up on altcoins.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume.While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor ( CEA ) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

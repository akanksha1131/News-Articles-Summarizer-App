Index View: NIFTY

NIFTY BANK

Bank Nifty consolidated in a 2000 points range in the last 6 sessions after the recent strong rally of 5500 points or 11% in the preceding 6 sessions underpinned by robust institutional accumulation in frontline banking counters and a notable revival in FII inflows—reflecting a clear risk-on undertone. Rate cut hopes and positive result of the large cap private Banks boosted sentiment.

A sustained move above the recent high of 56,098 could trigger further upside toward the 56,800 levels in the coming sessions. However, if the index fails to surpass this level, the index is likely to extend the last 6 sessions consolidation within the 54,000–56,000 range, helping to ease the overbought conditions created by the recent sharp rally.

On the downside, key support is seen between 54,000-53,500, which corresponds to the gap-up region and the previous significant breakout zone.

Volatility is expected to stay elevated due to ongoing geopolitical tensions, developments related to tariffs, and the unfolding Q4 earnings season.

ITR filing FY 2024-25: New ITR-1 form notified with major changes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/taxation/itr-filing-fy-2024-25-new-itr-1-form-notified-with-major-changes-heres-what-taxpayers-should-know/articleshow/120785747.cms,"ITR filing: For individuals and those not requiring account audits, the submission deadline remains July 31.

ITR-1 for income tax return FY 2024-25:

Salaried individuals and those under the presumptive taxation scheme can now file ITR-1 and ITR-4 respectively if their long-term capital gains (LTCG) are within Rs 1.25 lakh per fiscal year. Previously, these categories were required to file ITR-2.

According to I-T regulations, LTCG up to Rs 1.25 lakh from listed shares and mutual funds remains tax-exempt. Any gains above Rs 1.25 lakh annually attract a 12.5 per cent tax.

Similar to the previous version, ITR-1 requires individuals to provide information about foreign travel expenses surpassing Rs 2 lakh for themselves or others.

Additionally, it requires disclosure of electricity consumption costs exceeding Rs 1 lakh during the previous fiscal period.

What does the new ITR-1 mean for taxpayers?

New ITR forms for FY 2024-25: The Income Tax Department has issued a new ITR-1 and ITR-4 for tax filing purposes for the assessment year 2025-26, simplifying the process for individuals with long term capital gains up to Rs 1.25 lakh from listed equities.The forms include modifications regarding deductions under sections 80C, 80GG and others, featuring a drop down menu in the utility. Additionally, taxpayers must provide detailed section-wise information for TDS deductions.Tax filing can commence once the I-T department releases the utility for the 2024-25 fiscal year. For individuals and those not requiring account audits, the submission deadline remains July 31.Typically, ITR forms are released before the fiscal year ends, around February/March. This year's delay in form notification and filing utility occurred because revenue department officials were engaged with the new Income Tax Bill, presented to Parliament in February.Also Check | Latest income tax slabs FY 2025-26: What are the new income tax slabs, rates after Budget 2025 announcements? Check new vs old tax regime comparison - FAQs answered ITR Form 1 Sahaj is available for resident individuals with yearly earnings up to Rs 50 lakh, receiving income through salary, single property ownership, additional sources (interest) and farming revenue not exceeding Rs 5,000 annually.Parizad Sirwalla, Partner and Head, Global Mobility Services, Tax, KPMG in India told TOI, “As per the new forms notified for FY 2024-25, salaried individuals and individuals under presumptive taxation, can now use the simplified ITR-1 and ITR-4 respectively, if they only have long-term capital gains (LTCG) from sale of listed equity shares/ mutual funds, which are within the tax-exempted limit of INR 1.25 lakh per annum, assuming all other conditions are satisfied. Earlier, for any capital gains, the taxpayers were mandatorily required to file ITR-2/ITR-3 etc. as applicable”“Further, the new ITR-1/ ITR-4 forms, require the taxpayer to only report the total sales consideration, cost and amount of LTCG, as against the detailed disclosures required In Form ITR-2, ITR-3 etc., even though the LTCG within this limit is not taxable. This is a welcome measure towards simplifying tax compliance and reporting by taxpayers within this category,” she said.According to Samir Kanabar, Tax Partner at EY India, this move reflects a clear shift towards enhancing taxpayer services by allowing individual taxpayers to file simplified tax return where they have long-term capital gains up to Rs 1.25 lacs.“Thereby, it removes the burden of navigating more complex forms. The change is expected to encourage greater voluntary compliance, reduce filing-related stress, and make the system more inclusive and user-friendly for small taxpayers. We hope that this is just the beginning towards better compliance and simplification and expect more to come,” he said.“Forms ITR-1 and ITR-4 for Assessment Year 2025-26 remain largely consistent with the previous year. Notably, the updated forms bring relief to individuals with long-term capital gains taxable under Section 112A of the Income Tax Act provided these gains do not exceed the threshold of ₹1.25 lakhs, as earlier such taxpayers had to file return in ITR 2/ITR 3, which are more detailed forms. This is a welcome move by the Government and marks a positive step toward improving taxpayer services by allowing individuals within this category to file a simplified return which was not allowed till last year,” says Divya Baweja, Partner, Deloitte India.Sandeep Jhunjhunwala, Tax Partner at Nangia Andersen LLP stated that previously, salaried individuals with capital gains income needed to file ITR-2, even when these gains were exempt under Section 112A's threshold limit, necessitating comprehensive disclosures including capital gain accrual or receipt information and securities details.Also Read | Save up to Rs 1.1 lakh! How income tax slab changes will benefit taxpayers at different salary levels under new regime The new ITR-1 form for AY 2025-26 has been modified to include a dedicated portion for reporting LTCG income that is tax-exempt within the limits specified under Section 112A, thus reducing filing complications.""However, in cases, where the taxpayer earns LTCG under Section 112A in excess of Rs 125,000 or where the taxpayer earns any other LTCG other than that taxable under Section 112A or earns short term capital gains or has carried forward or brought forward capital losses or derived income from any combination of the above, the salaried individual would have to resort to Form ITR-2 for filing return of income,"" Jhunjhunwala said.","ITR-1 for income tax return FY 2024-25: Salaried individuals and those under the presumptive taxation scheme can now file ITR-1.

Open till 7pm? RBI panel calls for extending money market hours,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/open-till-7pm-rbi-panel-calls-for-extending-money-market-hours/articleshow/120836433.cms,"MUMBAI: With UPI and other digital rails keeping money in motion round-the-clock - and India's markets becoming more entwined with global ones - an RBI panel has proposed extending money market hours to 7pm from 5pm. The shift would give banks greater flexibility in managing short-term liquidity and accessing interbank and central bank funds.The recommendations come from a working group set up to review trading and settlement hours across RBI-regulated markets. The panel argued that trading hours shape how efficiently markets function, affecting liquidity, volatility, and price discovery. Since the last major review in 2019, India's financial markets expanded in size and complexity, with more participants, a broader range of products, and increased non-resident activity-especially in govt securities and derivatives following regulatory and index changes. Tighter links between onshore and offshore markets, advances in trading infrastructure, and round-the-clock payment systems altered liquidity dynamics, prompting the need to revisit market timings, the panel said.In money markets, the panel proposed extending call money trading to 7pm, with the reporting window for such transactions to close at 7:30pm. It also recommended that market repo and triparty repo (TREP) trade until 4pm, an hour later than the current close.In line with the trading extension, the settlement window for repo deals would shift to 5:30-6:30pm.To align market operations at the start of the day, the panel suggested moving forward the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) auction to 9.30-10am. Fine-tuning operations would continue at the central bank's discretion throughout the day.","The shift would give banks greater flexibility in managing short-term liquidity and accessing interbank and central bank funds.

This was driven by the fastest upturn in exports in 14 years, possibly triggered by production shift to India against the backdrop of global trade tensions.Despite rising marginally from 58.1 in March to 58.2 in April, the HSBC India Manufacturing Purchasing Managers ' Index ( PMI ) showed the strongest improvement in the health of the sector in ten months. The 50-point mark separates expansion from contraction in the survey, which is compiled from responses to questionnaires sent to 400 manufacturing firms.Sub-sector data showed robust expansions, with the fastest increase registered at consumer goods makers. A key factor contributing to the latest improvement in output growth was a sharp rise in new business. Respondents attributed growth to better domestic and international demand. With the sole exception of Jan, new business from overseas grew to the greatest extent in over 14 years at the start of the 2025-26 fiscal year. Participants cited Africa, Asia, Europe, the Middle East, and the Americas as the key areas for robust demand.""The notable increase in new export orders in April may indicate a potential shift in production to India, as businesses adapt to the evolving trade landscape and US tariff announcements,"" said Pranjul Bhandari , chief India economist at HSBC","Growth momentum in the country's manufacturing sector improved in April, with output increasing at the fastest pace since June 2024.

Our focus is on the entire logistics chain for importers and exporters. This includes port logistics, rail, warehousing, trucking, marine services - all of it. The goal is to evolve into a transport utility that can forecast cargo flows not just for the next five years, but for the next 10, 15, or even 20 years,"" Karan (38) told TOI. He, however, added that there are no plans right now to change the name of the company to match the changing business profile.When asked how the revenue will comprise tracking the transformation, he said, ""Ports are still the core of our business and will stay that way for the next five years. Beyond that-say in 10 years-logistics could potentially become larger as we scale.

"After LNG, government may hike fertiliser imports from US",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/after-lng-government-may-hike-fertiliser-imports-from-us/articleshow/120836963.cms,"NEW DELHI: After LNG , govt is exploring the possibility of increasing fertiliser imports from the US as it seeks to address US President Donald Trump 's concerns over the trade balance being in India's favour.The move will also help India reduce its dependence on countries, such as China and Russia, which are among the top sources of shipments. In fact, like oil, fertiliser imports from Russia shot up, following sanctions on Moscow in the wake of the Ukraine war. As a result, India's trade deficit with Russia grew manifold.India relies heavily on imported fertilisers, valued at $8.3 billion during the last financial year, with the US having a minuscule share, with the value of shipments pegged at $300,000. Last year, India had a trade surplus of over $41 billion with the US, while its goods imports were valued at $86.5 billion.While the proposed bilateral trade agreement with the US will focus on bridging the trade gap by lowering tariffs, govt is also looking at importing more American goods, including defence equipment and oil and gas.India is hoping that in return for items of America's interests, including automobiles, whiskey and farm goods, it will be able to get better access for its labour-intensive exports, such as leather and textiles products. Sixteenth Finance Commission chairman Arvind Panagariya said a deal with the US will put India ""incredibly favourably"", helping it attract investment and boost manufacturing, while flagging labour and land reforms.""India, itself, if it actually successfully negotiates a trade agreement with the US, will open a door a little wider to having an agreement with the EU and UK, that will place India in the global trade equation incredibly favourably,"" he said at an event organised by Isaac Centre for Public Policy . He said the trade restrictions by the US on China, Vietnam, and Cambodia will place India in a favourable position.","The move will also help India reduce its dependence on countries, such as China and Russia, which are among the top sources of shipments.

Must be agile to tackle challenges: Finance secretary Ajay Seth,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/must-be-agile-to-tackle-challenges-finance-secretary-ajay-seth/articleshow/120836847.cms,"NEW DELHI: While sounding upbeat about the economy, finance secretary Ajay Seth on Friday underlined the need to ensure fiscal consolidation and remain agile to deal with challenges facing the economy.""India can't remain fixated. We have to be adept and agile, and as things are evolving, we cannot take things for granted. India is close to a $4 trillion economy. We have enough resilience to find whatever the rest of the world is doing, we have to find our way, and I'm hopeful that we can find out,"" he said at an event organised by Isaac Centre for Public Policy The comments come amid expectations of a global economic slowdown triggered by US President Donald Trump 's tariff hikes. Seth said the Indian economy was projected to expand by 6.3-6.8% this year and the numbers pointed to healthy tax collections during the March quarter.Referring to the focus on re-prioritising expenditure through the Centre's focus on capex, the top civil servant in the finance ministry underlined the need for states to tackle revenue deficit. Some of the state govts, including some of the high-income states, are moving towards financing current expenditure rather than investing in people, he cautioned.""One has to remain committed and deliver on that for two reasons, and one of the reasons why credit rating agencies look more cautiously towards India is the elevated debt level,"" he said.Seth also said that rating agencies provided 15% weight to governance and depended on a World Bank index, which was based on a survey. Emerging economies, including India, have asked the World Bank to make its World Governance Index more objective.The second issue was to raise the tax-to-GDP ratio from 18% to around 20%. ""But we are at the sweetest spot at the current level of income. We aspire to be 20%, and that will take five-six years,"" he said.Seth, who just returned from the annual meetings of the World Bank and IMF , said that countries are seeking a rebalancing in the global trade architecture.About energy transition, he said its importance has come down, with countries across the globe now focusing on energy security in the changed world order. ""It was more about energy security, which was being talked about (at the recent World Bank-IMF annual meeting). Of course, there are a few economies that were still very bullish about it, but the general sense was the energy security..."" he said.","India is close to a $4 trillion economy.

"Rupee jumps to 83.78/$ intraday, a 6-month high",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/rupee-jumps-to-83-78/-intraday-a-6-month-high/articleshow/120835971.cms,"MUMBAI: The rupee briefly touched a six-month high on Friday, climbing to 83.78 against the dollar in early trade, before retreating following probably RBI intervention.The domestic currency closed at 84.58, 9 paise weaker than its previous close of 84.49. Traders attributed the initial strength to strong portfolio inflows and the unwinding of bearish rupee bets, but said dollar-buying by state-run banks, likely on behalf of RBI, eroded gains. According to dealers, RBI may be aiming to prevent the rupee from appreciating too sharply against the Chinese yuan , as a stronger rupee could undermine export competitiveness and widen the current account deficit.The rupee appreciated nearly 1% during the week, buoyed by inflows into Indian equities and optimism surrounding a potential US-India trade deal. It has risen over 3% in the past two months, recovering most losses incurred after the US elections.Meanwhile, forex reserves increased for the eighth consecutive week, reaching $688.13 billion as of April 25. This is the highest level in over six months, though still about $17 billion below the Sept 2023 record of $704.9 billion. Reserves rose by $2 billion during the week, and by $47.5 billion cumulatively over the previous seven weeks.These changes reflect both RBI's intervention in the forex market and valuation shifts in foreign assets. During the latest reserve data week, the rupee depreciated 0.1% on a weekly basis, which traders attributed to geopolitical tensions with Pakistan The dollar fell on Friday ahead of jobs data but remained on track for a third straight weekly gain, supported by earlier gains in Treasuries and equities. The yen rose 0.5%, the euro 0.4%, and China's offshore yuan hit a near six-month high. The Australian and New Zealand dollars also strengthened on positive equity moves tied to tariff talks involving China and Japan Dealers said that the dollar came under pressure as hopes of a rate cut in the US are dimming because of tariff-fuelled inflation fears. Historically, hardening of US yields have resulted in global funds moving into US securities resulting in a sharp gain in the dollar. However, this time global funds are wary and the dollar index had fallen to 99.9.","The domestic currency closed at 84.58, 9 paise weaker than its previous close of 84.49.

NEW DELHI: India will be the primary manufacturing country for supplying iPhones to the US beginning June quarter as Apple , the world's biggest electronics seller, rejigs global sourcing locations to factor in the Trump administration's reciprocal tariffs plans, especially on its biggest production hub China, CEO Tim Cook said on Friday.The move will see Taiwanese Foxconn and the Tata group, Apple's two contract manufacturers for iPhones in India, ramp up capacities as their factories will be used for supplies not only for the domestic need here, but also for the large American market, which is one of the company's biggest sales regions.Apple CEO Tim Cook said, ""For the June quarter, we do expect the majority of iPhones sold in the US will have India as their country of origin.""And while India takes charge of iPhones in America, Vietnam will be the ""country of origin"" for almost all iPad, Mac, Apple Watch and AirPods products also sold in the US, Cook added. This way, the company looks to dodge any debilitating tariffs impact on China and insulate itself from major retail price hikes in the US market.So, what happens to China and the vast manufacturing setup in the country? ""China would continue to be the country of origin for the vast majority of total product sales outside the US,"" the Apple CEO said, indicating that demand in 'rest of world' (beyond the US) will be met from there.But while Apple prepares India for a mega manufacturing push, the company also needs to factor in the fast-paced growth it is witnessing in the domestic market itself. India remains on the coveted list of countries where its volumes are creating quarterly records. ""We set a number of quarterly records in countries and regions across the world, including the UK, Spain, Finland, Brazil, Chile, Turkey, Poland, India, and the Philippines,"" Cook said.He said Apple is closer to expanding its physical retail presence in India beyond the two company-owned stores it has in New Delhi and Mumbai. Cook said there will be ""new retail stores in India starting later this year"". Apple's reshuffling of manufacturing schedules comes in as the company tries to protect itself from tariffs shocks, especially in its biggest manufacturing base, China.Cook announced that tariffs could cost the company approximately $900 million in the current quarter. He said the situation is uncertain at this moment as it is yet not clear where the final tariffs on each country will end up, since the US administration has just started negotiations with each country and region. ""We are not able to precisely estimate the impact of tariffs, as we are uncertain of potential future actions prior to the end of the quarter. ""Despite the challenges, Apple posted strong financial results with quarter revenue at $95.4 billion and profits of $24.8 billion, led by iPhone sales.","The move will see Taiwanese Foxconn and the Tata group, Apple's two contract manufacturers for iPhones in India, ramp up capacities.

US President Donald Trump’s 2026 budget proposal outlines sweeping cuts to non-defence domestic spending, totalling $163 billion, while ramping up expenditures on national security, the White House announced Friday.The proposal targets diversity initiatives and climate change programs, reflecting the administration's political priorities. However, it notably omits detailed projections for income taxes, tariffs, or the federal deficit — a sign of the significant political and financial challenges Trump faces as he pledges tax cuts and debt repayment without harming economic growth, according to news agency AP.While presidential budgets are not binding, they serve as key indicators of an administration’s goals for the upcoming fiscal year. This marks Trump’s first budget since returning to the White House and underscores his second-term agenda alongside Republican efforts in Congress.Trump’s proposal comes amid a volatile economic environment triggered in part by his own tariff policies . The White House has imposed what could amount to hundreds of billions of dollars in tax increases through tariffs, raising concerns among consumers, CEOs, and global leaders about the risk of an economic downturn.The top-line figures released by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), now led by Russell Vought — a key figure in Project 2025 — reflect a ""skinny"" version of the budget, with more specifics promised in the coming weeks. “Details soon,” Vought told a Cabinet meeting earlier this week.With the federal budget surpassing $7 trillion, deficits nearing $2 trillion annually, and interest payments on the national debt approaching $1 trillion, the US debt has ballooned to $36 trillion. Much of this stems from pandemic-related spending, tax code changes, and increasing costs tied to aging-related healthcare programs like Medicare and Medicaid.The 2026 proposal reflects prior cost-cutting actions by Trump and the Department of Government Efficiency, now overseen by adviser Elon Musk, including a trimmed-down federal workforce. It may also preview new revenue sources, particularly from tariffs.Democrats are expected to fiercely oppose the plan, calling it a blueprint for slashing vital public programs. At the same time, congressional Republicans are working to draft Trump’s ""big, beautiful bill"" — a comprehensive legislative package combining tax cuts, spending reductions, and increased funding for mass deportations.House Speaker Mike Johnson, who has met with Trump multiple times this week, aims to pass the bill through the House by Memorial Day and forward it to the Senate. “We had a very productive and encouraging meeting at the White House this morning, and the remaining pieces of ‘The One, Big Beautiful Bill!’ are coming together very well,"" Johnson, R-La., said in a statement following Thursday’s meeting with Trump and key committee leaders.Still, divisions persist within the Republican ranks as they try to pass the bill over Democratic opposition. “We are awaiting some final calculations on a few of the tax components, and we expect to be able to complete that work on a very aggressive schedule,” Johnson added.Cabinet officials are now preparing to testify before Congress on their respective budget requests, with Vought expected to appear in the coming weeks to defend the administration’s plan.A veteran of conservative fiscal policy, Vought previously served in the same role during Trump’s first term and authored a chapter in Project 2025 detailing a federal government overhaul. He is also preparing a $9 billion rescission package aimed at cutting current 2025 funding for the US Agency for International Development and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which includes PBS and NPR.On Thursday, Trump signed an executive order instructing federal agencies and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting to halt funding for PBS and NPR — a move that aligns with the rescission package and signals more cuts could follow","US President Donald Trump’s 2026 budget proposal outlines sweeping cuts to non- defence domestic spending, totalling $163 billion.

Driving the news

Why it matters

The big picture: Tariffs start to bite

The official Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) fell to 49.0 in April, marking the worst contraction in 16 months, per China’s National Bureau of Statistics.

New export orders cratered to 44.7, the lowest since December 2022.

The China Containerized Freight Index is down 26% this year.

Export cargo volumes dropped 10% in April versus a 4% increase in March, according to IMF-Oxford’s PortWatch.

Shipping platform Flexport says 25% of Transpacific Eastbound routes were canceled in late April — surpassing even early-pandemic levels.

Zoom in: Pain on the factory floor

In Zhejiang province, one of China’s top export hubs, businesses are struggling to stay afloat.

Yiwu trader Ding Heng, whose firm exports plastic Christmas trees, says US orders have halted completely. “There’s still time now. After two months there won’t be,” Ding told the Economist.

Other businesses share the strain: Shuangma, a plastics manufacturer, says canceled orders have cost it $20 million.

A white-goods company in Ningbo reported 3,000 American orders canceled.

Su Zhan, whose company makes red MAGA hats, said half of his orders vanished after the new tariffs took effect. “Perhaps shipping them to Mexico and scraping off the ‘Made in China’ label might work,” Su quipped.

Still, not all resentment is aimed at Washington. Some exporters acknowledge the US is simply protecting its industrial base.

“Without manufacturing, a country’s power will wane,” one Yiwu trader told The Economist.

Between the lines: Beijing’s quiet retreat?

Created an exemption list for select US goods — such as pharmaceuticals, jet engines, and microchips.

Accelerated domestic stimulus plans to prop up affected sectors.

Held multiple high-level economic meetings, including a Politburo session, to signal readiness for policy support.

At a news conference, officials from the National Development and Reform Commission pledged more stimulus in Q2 to offset export losses.

What they’re saying

President Trump on Wednesday struck a confident tone: “There’s a very good chance we could do a deal with China.”

Treasury secretary Scott Bessent, speaking to Fox Business: “First, we need to de-escalate, and then we’ll start focusing on a larger trade deal.”

Interim national security sdviser Marco Rubio, a longtime China hawk: “The Chinese are reaching out... They want to meet, they want to talk.” Rubio also warned Beijing's recent tone shift is driven by economic necessity, not goodwill.

Market pulse: Traders scent a thaw

Markets responded swiftly to China’s messaging:

Hang Seng China Enterprises Index rose over 1%.

Offshore yuan climbed 0.3% to 7.2566 per dollar.

Even the Australian dollar, seen as a China proxy, extended gains on the optimism.

Bloomberg economists Chang Shu and Eric Zhu noted that while signs of pressure are mounting, “it is critical that China backs up its message with speedy and effective stimulus.”

What’s next: Stalemate or soft landing?

Meanwhile, structural issues persist

Domestic consumer demand remains weak, hobbled by a property crisis.

Many Chinese manufacturers lack easy alternatives to the US market.

Attempts to divert exports to other regions have run into global overcapacity concerns.

“Although the government is stepping up fiscal support, this is unlikely to fully offset the drag,” said Zichun Huang of Capital

“We expect the economy to expand just 3.5% this year.”

Global banks, including UBS and Goldman Sachs, have revised down China’s 2025 GDP growth projections from 5% to as low as 3.8%.

A tipping point?

It has taken almost 100 days. In fact, it has taken nearly seven years, but US President Donald Trump may have finally landed a body blow in his long-running trade confrontation with Chinese President Xi Jinping . This week, a subtle but unmistakable signal emerged from Beijing: China is ""evaluating"" overtures from the US to begin trade negotiations. It’s the first time Chinese officials have publicly acknowledged Washington’s request to talk tariffs since Trump hiked duties to historic levels—145% on some imports.China’s commerce ministry on Friday confirmed it is “evaluating” multiple US overtures to begin trade talks over President Donald Trump’s sweeping new tariffs - which impose duties of up to 145% (even up to 245% in ""rare"" cases) on Chinese goods. The ministry signaled openness to dialogue but warned sharply that “coercion and extortion” won’t yield results.“The US has recently taken the initiative on many occasions to convey information to China... saying it hopes to talk with China,” said the ministry. “Attempting to use talks as a pretext to engage in coercion and extortion would not work.”This is the first public acknowledgment from Beijing that Trump’s tariff pressure may be forcing a recalibration - or at least a rethink - in China’s trade posture.The shift comes amid clear signs that China’s economy is reeling from the trade war's second round. With factory activity shrinking, exports plunging, and supply chains disrupted, Beijing now appears more willing to engage — even if publicly it continues to frame talks as a matter of principle, not pressure.At the same time, markets are interpreting the signals as the first crack in the trade standoff, driving up Asian equities and currency values.“The high level of reciprocal tariffs on China is not sustainable,” said economist Woei Chen Ho of United Overseas Bank. “The beginning of negotiations will likely drive market volatility again because it is not expected to be plain sailing.”The impact of Trump’s tariffs is showing up across China’s economy.The root cause: Trump's ""Liberation Day"" tariff package, which ratcheted up total duties on Chinese goods to 245% in some categories, including electronics, appliances, and machinery.“It’s definitely worse than expected. It shows tariffs started to bite,” said Robin Xing, chief China economist at Morgan Stanley.While China’s official tone remains firm, its actions suggest retreat. Beijing has:Still, China insists it won’t enter talks without “sincerity” from Washington - namely, tariff rollbacks.“If we fight, we will fight to the end; if we talk, the door is open,” the commerce ministry said. “But saying one thing and doing another... will not work on the Chinese side.”Despite the shift in tone, a formal breakthrough remains elusive. Beijing continues to tie any negotiation to the rollback of Trump’s 145% tariffs, which the White House has so far resisted.So where does that leave us? In a familiar place: mutual suspicion, economic pain, and no formal negotiation schedule. But unlike past rounds of this drama, the advantage-for now-appears to be in Washington’s corner.China is not collapsing. But it is blinking.Trump’s tariff escalation has hit its mark. With China’s exports, production, and optimism all sliding, Beijing is now reassessing its options. While it hasn't capitulated, the change in rhetoric and behind-the-scenes moves suggest the pressure is real.Whether this leads to real de-escalation or a new standoff will depend on whether both sides can translate tactical maneuvering into meaningful dialogue - without either appearing to blink.(With inputs from agencies)","The official Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) fell to 49.0 in April, marking the worst contraction in 16 months. 25% of Transpacific Eastbound routes were canceled in late April — surpassing even early-pandemic levels.

Wall Street surged Friday after a stronger-than-expected US jobs report eased investor concerns about the economy, sending the S&P 500 toward its longest winning streak in two decades.As of 1:10 pm Eastern, The S&P 500 rose 1.5% in afternoon trading, on pace for a ninth consecutive day of gains. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 571 points, or 1.4%, while the Nasdaq composite advanced 1.6%.The rally was broad-based, with around 90% of stocks in the S&P 500 moving higher and every sector in the green. Tech led the charge, with Microsoft up 2.7% and Nvidia gaining 2.2%. Apple, however, slipped 4.2% after warning it faces a $900 million tariff hit.Financials also posted strong gains—JPMorgan Chase added 2.5%, and Visa climbed 1.5%.The Labour Department reported that employers added 177,000 jobs in April—slower than March but above economists’ expectations. The data, however, doesn’t fully capture the impact of President Donald Trump’s steep new tariffs, which began hitting global trade in April, though most were delayed by three months.“We’ve already seen how financial markets will react if the administration moves forward with their initial tariff plan,” said Chris Zaccarelli, CIO of Northlight Asset Management.“Unless they take a different tack in July when the 90-day pause expires, we will see market action similar to the first week of April.”Back then, the S&P 500 fell 9.1% amid fears over Trump’s tariff escalation.

With input from AP)

The US nonfarm payroll employment rose by 177,000 in April, while the unemployment rate remained unchanged at 4.2 percent, according to the latest report from the US Bureau of Labour Statistics.Employment continued to trend up in health care, transportation and warehousing, financial activities, and social assistance, although federal government employment declined as businesses navigated the early months of Donald Trump's second presidency.The unemployment rate has remained in a narrow range of 4.0 to 4.2 percent since May 2024. In April, the number of unemployed persons was 7.2 million, showing little change over the month. Among major worker groups, the unemployment rate for adult men was 4.0 percent, for adult women 3.7 percent, for teenagers 12.9 percent, for Whites 3.8 percent, for Blacks 6.3 percent, for Asians 3.0 percent, and for Hispanics 5.2 percent. These rates showed little or no change in April.The number of long-term unemployed—those jobless for 27 weeks or more—increased by 179,000 in April to 1.7 million. This group accounted for 23.5 percent of the total unemployed population.The labour force participation rate was 62.6 percent in April, and the employment-population ratio was 60.0 percent. Both measures changed little over the month and have shown little movement over the year.In April, 4.7 million people were employed part time for economic reasons. This number changed little from the previous month. These individuals preferred full-time employment but were working part time because their hours had been reduced or they were unable to find full-time work.The number of people not in the labour force who currently wanted a job was 5.7 million in April, showing little change from the prior month. These individuals were not counted as unemployed because they had not actively looked for work during the four weeks preceding the survey or were unavailable to take a job.Among those not in the labour force who wanted a job, 1.6 million were marginally attached to the labour force in April, also showing little change. These individuals wanted and were available for work and had looked for a job sometime in the prior 12 months but had not searched in the four weeks preceding the survey. The number of discouraged workers, a subset of the marginally attached who believed no jobs were available for them, stood at 414,000 and also changed little.According to the establishment survey, the increase of 177,000 in nonfarm payroll employment in April was close to the average monthly gain of 152,000 over the prior 12 months. Health care added 51,000 jobs in April, similar to its average monthly gain of 52,000 over the past year. Within health care, hospitals added 22,000 jobs and ambulatory health care services added 21,000.E mployment in transportation and warehousing increased by 29,000 in April, following an increase of 3,000 in March. Within the sector, warehousing and storage added 10,000 jobs, couriers and messengers 8,000, and air transportation 3,000. The sector had averaged 12,000 new jobs per month over the previous year.Employment in financial activities rose by 14,000 in April. Since its most recent trough in April 2024, the industry has added 103,000 jobs.Social assistance employment increased by 8,000 in April, below the average monthly gain of 20,000 over the prior 12 months.Federal government employment decreased by 9,000 in April and is down by 26,000 since January.Yet many economists fear that the US job market will deteriorate if economic growth takes a hit from trade wars.Trump’s massive taxes on imports to the US are likely to raise costs for Americans and American businesses that depend on supplies from overseas. They also threaten to slow economic growth. His immigration crackdown threatens to make it more difficult for hotels, restaurants and construction firms to fill job openings. By purging federal workers and cancelling federal contracts, Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency risks wiping out jobs inside the government and out.“Looking ahead, we expect the steep tariff increases and the surge in uncertainty and financial market volatility will result in a more pronounced labour market downshift than previously anticipated,” Lydia Boussour, senior economist at the accounting and consulting giant EY, wrote this week. “Large cuts to the federal workforce and the cancellations of many government contracts will also be a drag on payroll growth in coming months. ’’A slowdown in immigration “will weigh on labour supply dynamics, further constraining job growth. We foresee the unemployment rate rising toward 5% in 2025.’’","US nonfarm payroll employment rose by 177,000 in April, while the unemployment rate remained unchanged at 4.2 percent.

Japan’s finance minister Katsunobu Kato has for the first time publicly floated the possibility of using the country’s vast US Treasury holdings , worth over $1 trillion, as a potential card in ongoing trade negotiations with Washington, reported Reuters.In a televised interview on Friday, Kato said the primary purpose of holding such large amounts of US government debt was to ensure Japan has enough liquidity for yen intervention if needed.However, when asked if the holdings might be used as a bargaining chip in trade talks with the US, Kato acknowledged, “We obviously need to put all cards on the table in negotiations. It could be among such cards.” He quickly added, “Whether we actually use that card, however, is a different question.”Kato’s remarks mark a shift from his previous stance last month when he ruled out using Japan’s Treasury holdings in trade talks. The comments come after April's global sell-off in US Treasuries, which followed US President Donald Trump’s decision to impose sweeping tariffs on trade partners, including Japan.According to news agency Reuters, the sell-off and its market disruption may have influenced Washington’s tone in bilateral talks.While Kato declined to say whether the Treasury issue was directly discussed with US treasury secretary Scott Bessent during recent meetings, he noted that market developments “likely affected Washington’s approach” in the dialogue.Despite being one of Washington’s closest allies, Japan's enormous presence in the US bond market gives it strategic weight. Analysts believe Japan, which relies heavily on exports to the US, particularly in automobiles, has limited leverage outside of financial markets.“Playing the card early, while the US bond market is in the minds of the administration after recent weeks, is a smart move,” said Martin Whetton of Westpac, quoted by Reuters. “They don’t have to do anything. But they can put themselves in a solid position to negotiate.”Naka Matsuzawa, chief macro strategist at Nomura, was quoted by Reuters that Japan’s Treasury stockpile “should be a card if not an ace card for the negotiation,” especially amid tensions over currency rates . Though Kato said there was no discussion on specific exchange rate targets with Bessent, Tokyo has been under pressure from Trump, who accused Japan of weakening the yen to gain a trade advantage, an allegation Japan denies.Japan’s trade envoy Ryosei Akazawa also said Thursday’s talks in Washington were “frank and constructive” and confirmed a third round is expected in mid-May.Speaking to reporters, he said both sides discussed tariffs, non-tariff measures, and economic security . “We were able to advance concrete discussions,” said Akazawa, according to news agency AFP.Despite no breakthroughs yet, Japan has stressed it is ""firmly defending"" its interests. “We don’t keep (the Treasury holdings) to support the US,” Kato reiterated on TV Tokyo. “We will intervene if our country is in trouble.”","Katsunobu Kato has for the first time publicly floated the possibility of using the country’s vast US Treasury holdings as a potential card in ongoing trade negotiations with Washington.

McDonald’s joined Chipotle and other restaurant chains that have seen customers grow cautious about the economy and inflation.Consumer surveys show pessimism is shooting higher about where the economy heading. On Thursday, a couple reports about the economy came in mixed, following up on several recent updates that suggested it’s weakening.The first of the reports said more US workers filed for unemployment benefits last week than economists had forecast, setting the stage for a more comprehensive report on the job market arriving Friday.The fear on Wall Street is for a possible worst-case scenario called “stagflation,” where the economy stagnates yet inflation remains high. The Federal Reserve has no good tools to fix both such problems at the same time.

Donald Trump tariff impact: Civil disorder and unrest has broken out across China as severe tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump are expected to severely impact the country's export-based economy, leading to business closures, wage defaults and large-scale worker demonstrations, according to a NewsMax report.Demonstrations and civil unrest are expanding throughout China as the economic consequences of Trump's tariffs push manufacturing industries towards collapse, resulting in factory shutdowns and leaving countless workers without wages.From manufacturing regions close to Shanghai extending to distant parts of Inner Mongolia, labourers have organised street protests demanding payment of dues and opposing widespread redundancies. This turmoil comes as Chinese export orders have plummetted to levels not seen since the COVID-19 lockdown period.Near Shanghai, an LED light production facility witnessed thousands of workers demonstrating over salary arrears extending back to January.

Corporate ties and shared history

Fallout at Kohl’s

What’s next for Holt?

Chandra Holt, once considered one of the most promising executives in American retail, is now at the center of a corporate scandal involving her former Walmart colleague, and reported former romantic partner, Ashley Buchanan Buchanan was fired this week as CEO of Kohl’s after the company accused him of engineering a vendor deal riddled with “undisclosed conflicts of interest.”According to a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, Buchanan directed Kohl’s to enter into a multimillion-dollar contract with a vendor that allegedly had “highly suspicious” and “favorable” terms. The filing did not name the vendor or the individual involved, but The Wall Street Journal identified the woman as Chandra Holt.In a statement to The Journal, Holt confirmed she had known Buchanan for a decade but denied any business wrongdoing. “I’ve known Ashley Buchanan for 10 years, but I have not received any compensation for my Incredibrew business from Kohl’s,” she said.Holt is the founder and CEO of Incredibrew, a coffee brand she launched in 2022 that claims to infuse beverages with vitamins and minerals. It remains unclear whether Incredibrew was the vendor involved in the Kohl’s deal under scrutiny.Buchanan and Holt first crossed paths at Walmart, where they worked closely before departing around the same time for other executive roles. Buchanan left in early 2020 to head arts-and-crafts giant Michaels, while Holt exited in 2021 to become CEO of Conn’s HomePlus.Most recently, she served as CEO of Beyond, Inc, the parent company of Overstock.com and Bed Bath & Beyond, between February 2024 and June 2024.Her impressive résumé includes leadership stints at Target, Sam’s Club, and Walgreens. She holds a Bachelor of Arts in advertising, PR, and communications from the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities, and an MBA in strategy and marketing from the Carlson School of Management.Buchanan’s exit comes amid a challenging period for Kohl’s. The company reported a 7.2% drop in annual sales to $15.4 billion and announced plans to close more than two dozen underperforming stores. The firing triggered serious consequences: Buchanan must now forfeit all equity awards granted during his tenure and repay a prorated portion of his $2.5 million signing bonus.While Kohl’s emphasized that the CEO's termination had “no bearing on the company’s financial performance,” the incident adds turbulence to a company already struggling with leadership instability . Buchanan was the third CEO in as many years, following short-lived tenures by Tom Kingsbury and Michelle Gass.Although no formal allegations have been made against Holt, her name is now linked to a boardroom controversy that could complicate her professional path. With her leadership record and entrepreneurial success through Incredibrew, the coming months may determine whether Holt can distance herself from the scandal or whether her past with Buchanan will cast a longer shadow.","Chandra Holt is the founder and CEO of Incredibrew, a coffee brand she launched in 2022 that claims to infuse beverages with vitamins and minerals.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.","Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain.

The Series A funding round was led by Lightspeed Venture Partners , and participants included Silicon Valley billionaire Vinod Khosla’s Khosla Ventures and Peak XV Partners , formerly Sequoia Capital India & Southeast Asia, Sarvam said Thursday.The Bangalore-based startup, until recently in stealth mode, was co-founded by Vivek Raghavan and Pratyush Kumar. It has ambitious plans to build open source foundational AI systems as well as tools for creating apps for the meager compute infrastructure available to developers in India. The startup has a total of 18 employees and is just opening an office in the city.""What we are showing is that you can build large language models with limited resources,” Raghavan said in a phone interview. ""We are building at a smaller scale and demonstrating that these can be extremely cost and energy efficient so they can be accessed by everyone.""Large language models, like OpenAI’s GPT-4 and Meta Platforms Inc.’s Llama, are powerful AI systems that understand by learning from vast amounts of diverse data from the internet and elsewhere to summarize, translate, and create text, audio and video for a wide range of applications. The rivalry to develop ever-more sophisticated models is heating up in Silicon Valley and such efforts have attracted billions of dollars in investments.","Sarvam AI is building large language models targeted at unique uses in Indian languages at price points that the country’s 1.4 billion people can afford.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor ( CEA ) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart.

That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says.

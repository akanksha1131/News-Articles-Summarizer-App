New flashpoint? Trump threatens extra 5% tariff on Mexico,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/new-flashpoint-trump-threatens-extra-5-tariff-on-mexico-heres-why/articleshow/125856771.cms,"Trump Warns India On Rice Dumping As US Farmers Demand Action Against Cheap Imports

US-Mexico water treaty





US President Donald Trump reignited tensions with Mexico, threatening to impose a 5% tariff on Mexico over an ongoing water-sharing dispute, accusing the neighbouring country of withholding supplies guaranteed under a decades-old treaty.Posting on his Truth Social account on Monday (local time), Trump said that he will raise duties on Mexican imports once again if the issue is not resolved.""I have authorized documentation to impose a 5% Tariff on Mexico if this water isn't released, IMMEDIATELY,"" he wrote, claiming that restricted water supplies are severely affecting crops and livestock in Texas.The disagreement stems from a 1944 treaty that governs water sharing between the two neighbours. Under the terms of that pact, the United States releases water from the Colorado River while Mexico sends flows from the Rio Grande.Trump says Mexico has fallen behind, stating that the country owes 800,000 acre-feet of water. He insisted that Mexico must ""release 200,000 acre-feet of water before December 31st, and the rest must come soon after,"" adding, ""The longer Mexico takes to release the water, the more our Farmers are hurt.""Trump’s warning was issued on the same day he announced a $12 billion support package for the US agriculture sector, which has been rattled by the consequences of his own trade and tariff policies.This is not the first time Trump has tied economic pressure to the water issue. In April, he previously issued a threat of consequences, after which Mexico moved to send water and said it would “continue fulfilling its commitments under the 1944 treaty.”Currently, Mexican goods face a 25% tariff unless protected by the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), the free trade deal finalised during Trump’s first term. The United States is preparing to pursue a renegotiation of the agreement in 2026.Last week, Trump met Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney during the 2026 World Cup draw. The future of the USMCA formed part of their discussions, marking the first in-person meeting between Trump and Sheinbaum.","US President Donald Trump threatens to impose a 5% tariff on Mexico over an ongoing water-sharing dispute.

Gold price prediction today: Where are gold prices headed this week and should you 'buy on dips'? Top factors to watch,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gold-price-prediction-today-where-are-gold-rates-headed-on-december-09-2025-and-in-the-near-term-mcx-gold-silver-prices/articleshow/125860611.cms,"Support is at $4160/$4115/$4085/$4050. Resistance is at $4245/$4300/$4381 (all-time high). (AI image)

Gold Performance:

On December 8, spot gold traded in a rather narrow range of $4176-$4219 as US yields spiked higher. At the time of writing this article, the yellow metal was trading at $4192, down 0.1% for the day, while the MCX February gold contract at Rs 129,770 was down 0.36%.

Earlier, in the week ending December 5, the yellow metal closed with a weekly loss of nearly 0.95% at $4198.

US Dollar and yields:

At the time of writing this article, the US Dollar Index, boosted by higher yields, was hovering around 99.20, up around 0.20% for the day.

Ten-year US yields at 4.17% were up by 0.90%, while 2-year yields at 3.59% were up around 1%.

US treasury yields climbed to the highest in more than two months on huge issuance by the Treasury (in total $119 billion this week) and inflation concerns as the Fed cuts rate into elevated inflation.

New York Treasury term premia, a measure of premium creeping higher, has risen to 0.7% -- around September level.

Fed Watch:

The markets are placing 90% odds on the FOMC cutting Fed Fund rate by 25 bps on December 10. Thereafter, markets assign 90% probability of the Fed cutting one more time by April.

ETFs and COMEX inventory:

As of December 5, total known global gold ETF holdings stood at 97.84MOz, highest since October 24. ETF holdings have risen 18% YTD (or 15 MOz, equivalent to 466 tons of net inflow).

Eligible COMEX Gold inventory stood at 18.277 MOz as of December 5, which is down 18.58% from the all-time high level of 22.45 seen in April 2025.

China's central extends its gold buying spree:

China's Central Bank PBoC increased its gold reserves again as it extended its gold buying spree to a 13th straight month as it bought 30,000 Ounces (around 1 ton) of gold.

China's forex reserves surged to the highest level since 2016 to nearly $3.35 trillion.

Bank for International Settlements (BIS) on gold:

According to the BIS, retail investors' gold buying frenzy has pushed the yellow metal out of its traditional safe haven pattern to a more speculative asset. The Bank added that while institutional investors bought gold to hedge their positions in over-extended equities, the retail investors' buying has amplified the trend. It also noted the fact that both equities and gold have been rallying together for the past few quarters, which is a rare occurrence in at least the last fifty years. The Bank cited the case of gold crashing in 1980s.

Data and event roundup:

Japan's 3Q annualized GDP came in at -2.3% as weak housing and exports weighed on the economy. However, this contraction is being seen as a blip. China's November trade surplus widened to $111.70 (forecast $103.10 billion) from $90.10 billion in October.

China's trade surplus exceeded $1 trillion for the first time.

China's Politburo, in its December huddle, has cited boosting domestic demand as its top goal in 2026 as top leaders pledged to strengthen cross-cyclical policy measures as they keep proactive fiscal and moderately loose monetary policies as possible tools to achieve their goals. The budget deficit target for 2026 could be around this year's 4% target.

US data released on Friday did little to change Fed rate cut probability. Real Personal spending in September stagnated Vs forecast of a 0.1% increase m-o-m. PCE Price Index data (Sep.), core PCE Price Index rose 2.8% y-o-y (forecast 2.8%, prior 2.7%). University of Michigan Sentiment (Dec. prel.) came in at 53.3 Vs the estimate of 52; it continues to be mired around historical low. One-year inflation expectations eased from 4.5% to 4.1% Vs the estimate of 4.5%.

Upcoming data:

Major US data on tap this week include JOLTs job openings (December 9), Employment cost index (Dec. 10) and trade balance (Dec. 11). Out of Asia, focus will be on China's new Yuan loans, PPI and CPI (Dec. 10).

However, the most important event of the week is upcoming Fed's monetary policy due on December 10, wherein the central bank is widely expected to cut the Fed Fund rate by 25 bps to 3.50%-3.75% target range. In addition to the rate decision, investors will pay close attention to the Fed's summary of projections which will include the Fed's forecasts of inflation, GDP and unemployment, too.

Gold Price Outlook:

Spot gold is well supported on rate cut expectations, rising fiscal concerns, deteriorating US job market and global trade flows suffering due to tariff wars. Geopolitical tensions remain elevated as the Ukraine talks have failed to make any headway. Also, President Trump calling for revival of Monroe doctrines is positive for the metal in the medium to long term.

Should the US nonfarm payroll report show continuing weakness in the job market, the yellow metal can reach new record highs soon.

Buying the dips is advisable.

Support is at $4160/$4115/$4085/$4050. Resistance is at $4245/$4300/$4381 (all-time high).

Silver Price Outlook:

Silver ETFs have recorded a net inflow of 132.50 MOz YTD as of December 6, which is equivalent to a net inflow of around 4121 tons. ETF holdings are up 18.50% YTD.

One-month LBMA swap rate, although significantly lower than the October frenzy level of 34.95%, is currently at 6.41%, which is quite elevated as compared to historical standards of 0.3%-0.5%.

We continue to remain bullish on silver as Chinese silver inventories in SHFE and SGE warehouses have fallen to around decade-low levels. In addition, huge ETF inflows continue to keep the metal buoyant despite surging US yields. It is advisable to buy the dips with stoploss below $56.40/$54 for a target of $62 in the coming weeks/months.

Netflix–Warner Bros deal: Trump concerned over OTT giant's ‘large market share’; asserts he will be ‘involved’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/netflixwarner-bros-deal-trump-concerned-over-ott-giants-large-market-share-asserts-he-will-be-involved/articleshow/125824450.cms,"Netflix Drops A $72b Bombshell On Hollywood With Mega Warner Bros Discovery Move | WHAT IT MEANS

US President Donald Trump on Sunday raised concerns about the recent Hollywood deal that shook up the media landscape, Netflix acquisition of Warner Bros. The US president, speaking to the media while arriving for the Kennedy Center Honors awards ceremony on Sunday, said that the proposed multi-billion-dollar acquisition raised concerns about market dominance.The streaming service, he argued, already commands significant power in the sector. Netflix has “a very large market share” and “it could be a problem.” He further hinted that the White House would be tied to deal, “I’ll be involved in that decision.”These remarks come as federal authorities weigh whether the nearly $83 billion deal should be allowed to proceed amid pushback from within Hollywood, where the prospect of further consolidation has triggered antitrust concerns.Despite the caution, Trump offered warm words for Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos, who met him at the White House recently, saying “he's done one of the greatest jobs in the history of movies.”The takeover would hand Netflix control of HBO Max in addition to Warner Bros. studios, the home of titles ranging from “Casablanca” and “Citizen Kane” to recent box-office juggernaut “Barbie.”In case the agreement stands as proposed, the streaming platform would also take possession of world-famous franchises including Harry Potter, the Lord of the Rings saga and DC Studios’ superheroes: Batman, Superman and Wonder Woman among them.However, the deal excludes Warner Bros.’ linear television channels. Discovery, CNN and other broadcast properties would be separated from the company before any sale is finalised.Warner Bros. Discovery announced in October that it was open to a sale after fielding multiple unsought bids. Netflix emerged ahead of rival interest from Comcast and from Paramount Skydance, the media business led by David Ellison, a figure known to be a major supporter of Trump.","US President Donald Trump raised concerns about the recent Hollywood deal that shook up the media landscape, Netflix acquisition of Warner Bros.

Govt to run pilot project to link fertiliser demand to farmland size: Nadda,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/govt-to-run-pilot-project-to-link-fertiliser-demand-to-farmland-size-nadda/articleshow/125880587.cms,"PTI file photo

NEW DELHI: The govt will run a pilot project to link the demand for subsidised fertiliser from farmers to the size of their farmland in order to prevent diversion, minister J P Nadda informed Rajya Sabha on Tuesday. The move is significant given the high use in farming of chemical nutrients, which is also affecting soil health.Replying to a supplementary question by BJP MP Kiran Chaudhry, Nadda said, “We are taking a pilot project where we are trying to see that the land area you (farmers) have and the fertiliser you want to have or are asking for have a link. This has to be taken care of. We are providing subsidised fertiliser to farmers. He (farmer) has the capacity to use 10 bags, but he is taking 50 bags. This has to be taken into consideration to prevent diversion and pilferage. ”At present, farmers can buy as many bags of subsidised fertiliser as they want.The minister said attempts are being made to create an impression that there is a shortage of fertiliser, whereas the govt has supplied adequate quantities to all states on time. He added that it is well known that fertiliser is being diverted and dealers are hoarding it.On the crackdown on black marketing, diversion and substandard products, Nadda said that in the past seven months, 5,371 licences of fertiliser firms have been cancelled and 649 FIRs have been registered.Separately, the Fertiliser Association of India (FAI), the apex body of the fertiliser industry, said that the import of soil nutrients—particularly urea—is estimated to jump 41 per cent to 22.3 million tonnes (MT) in 2025–26 due to a surge in domestic demand following good monsoon rains. It said India had imported 14.4 MT of fertiliser during April–Oct, up nearly 69 per cent from 8.6 MT a year earlier.Data show that India imported 136.6 per cent more urea as domestic production dropped 4 per centbetween April and Oct compared to the same period last year. Imports of diammonium phosphate (DAP), the second-most-used fertiliser in the country, rose 69.1 per cent while production fell 7.4 per cent in April–Oct 2025 compared to the same period in 2024.","The move is significant given the high use in farming of chemical nutrients, which is also affecting soil health.

$20Bn New Threshold For Local IPOs, Says JP Morgan I Deals Worth $23-25Bn This Yr

MUMBAI: New-age companies are revving up India's hot IPO market which is set to close the year with an estimated $23-$25 billion worth of deals, higher than the tally of $21 billion last year, bankers at J P Morgan said on Tuesday, adding that $20 billion or so will become the ""new threshold"" for Indian IPOs.New-age tech firms are a big driver for this boost in IPO deal momentum with about 20 more startups across sectors in various stages of preparing for a potential market debut next year, said Abhinav Bharti, managing director and head of India, equity capital markets at J P Morgan.""Roughly about 15%-20% of IPOs this year were driven by new-age tech companies. Going ahead, this share is expected to go up to between 25%-30%,"" said Bharti who is betting on tech startups to lead IPO deals next year alongside healthcare and consumer (traditional firms across durables, FMCG etc). The boom in IPO volumes comes even as the total equity flows into the capital markets are poised to end lower at about $65 billion from $72 billion last year on the back of a lower quantum of qualified institutional placements (QIP).A batch of startups including big players Lenskart, Groww and Meesho (listing on Wednesday) have made their debut on the exchanges this year, giving rich exits to early investors.In fact, PEs and VCs have been involved in about 50%-70% of IPOs this year in all, said bankers at the firm.""India is one of the top two markets in Asia (alongside Japan) where private equity has been more active. Ability to invest and exit assets through cycles has enabled this momentum,"" said Nitin Maheshwari, co-head of India investment banking at J P Morgan.If PEs can exit, they can deploy more capital in India where their annual count of investments have averaged close to $40 billion in the recent years, said Maheshwari. More founders and companies are increasingly looking at IPOs as a credible alternative for an exit, somewhat impacting M&A volumes.PhonePe, Zepto and Flipkart are among new age firms eyeing an IPO next year. ""There's a significant focus on having companies come to market after or when they are about to achieve profitability. Consumer tech companies that went for an IPO this year have recently turned profitable or demonstrated ability to turn profitable. This financial maturity and stable business models are driving the startup IPO boom,"" said Bharti. In all, at least 4-5 companies alone could raise $7-$8 billion through IPOs next year, he added.Even as foreign institutional investors (FIIs) have been selling an almost record amount of Indian equities, their investments in primary markets between IPOs and QIPs have touched $7 billion. The biggest (overall) market theme, though, is strong backing of domestic capital. ""When you have demand to the tune of domestics pumping in $80 billion, supply will react to it. And supply can either be through blocks or IPOs,"" said Bharti.",New-age tech firms are a big driver for this boost in IPO deal momentum. About 20 more startups across sectors are in various stages of preparing for a potential market debut next year. The boom in IPO volumes comes even as the total equity flows into the capital markets are poised to end lower.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125880062,imgsize-576506,width-400,resizemode-4/ipo-boom-startups-lead-charge-20-more-in-queue.jpg"

Housed Under Grasim, Clean Energy Biz Valued At ₹14.6K Cr

MUMBAI: BlackRock, one of the world's largest asset managers, is set to invest Rs 3,000 crore in Aditya Birla Group's renewable energy business for a minority stake. The business, housed under Grasim, has been valued at Rs 14,600 crore, highlighting the growing investor interest in India's clean energy sector.The move mirrors similar strategies adopted by other conglomerates, including Tata Group and Adani Group, which have also brought in external investors into their renewable energy ventures. Earlier, Qatar's Nebras Power had explored acquiring a 49% stake in Aditya Birla Renewables, but that deal did not materialise. At the time, other global investors, including Alberta Investment Management Corporation and BlackRock Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP), had expressed interest in the company.Tuesday's announcement confirms that discussions between Aditya Birla Group and GIP have progressed into a formal agreement, marking a significant step in the group's renewable energy business.Last year, NYSE-listed BlackRock acquired Global Infrastructure Partners, creating an infrastructure platform managing assets worth over $180 billion. Aditya Birla Renewables currently has a portfolio of 4.3 GW across 10 states, spanning solar, wind, hybrid, and floating solar projects, positioning it as one of India's prominent renewable energy players.Aditya Birla Group has been attracting marquee private equity investors across its businesses. These include Advent International and PremjiInvest in Aditya Birla Capital (with Advent exiting in Oct 2025), GIC of Singapore in Aditya Birla Fashion & Retail, and Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA) in Aditya Birla Health Insurance. These investments reflect the group's strategy of leveraging private capital to fuel growth while maintaining operational and strategic control over its businesses.Commenting on the deal, among the largest primary commitments by a private equity player in a renewables platform in India, Aditya Birla Group chairman Kumar Mangalam Birla said: ""GIP's investment marks a pivotal moment in our growth journey, laying a strong foundation for an accelerated buildout of our renewables platform, as we target a capacity of 10GW+ in the coming years. Their global leadership in owning and operating some of the most sophisticated energy assets worldwide brings both rigour and reach to our ambition. We see our renewables business emerging as a powerful growth engine.""","Aditya Birla Renewables currently has a portfolio of 4.3 GW across 10 states, spanning solar, wind, hybrid, and floating solar projects.

Claims of a disturbing message prompt scrutiny over loyalty and silence

Who Stood To Benefit From Charlie Kirk's Assassination? | Candace Ep 276





Allegations surrounding the reported final hours of political commentator Charlie Kirk have sparked a storm of speculation, and Candace Owens is at the center of it. On her show, she claimed that multiple people connected to Turning Point USA (TPUSA) were aware that Kirk believed he was in danger before he died.The statement has unsettled supporters and critics alike, not only because of the seriousness of the claim, but because of the silence Owens says has followed it. As the public awaits answers, her comments have ignited a wider discussion about loyalty, money, and secrecy in powerful political circles.Candace Owens stated that the information was passed to her by someone inside TPUSA and involved a late-night warning Kirk allegedly sent the night before his death. “What I can tell you is we also received a tip from somebody within Turning Point USA that the night before he died, I know for a fact, he messaged a donor and he messaged somebody at Turning Point USA.”She then revealed the most shocking part of the tip: “But I did not know, and this is what was told to me, that he also messaged Dan Flood, the security that's to his right, and allegedly, explicitly said that they are going to kill me tomorrow.”Owens emphasized that several people, including a donor and TPUSA members, allegedly knew Kirk feared he would be murdered. Yet, according to her, none of them have stepped forward with public statements. She challenged this silence, calling it a “massive question mark” and questioning whether fear, loyalty, or money is keeping people quiet.Her closing words suggested that the root of the silence may run deeper than personal loyalty. “And what we can say for certain is, of course, people will betray one another if money is on the line. It could be for 30 pieces of silver, or it could be for billions. But things get complicated when there's a lot of money on the line.”As the mystery deepens, Owens’ claims have placed TPUSA under intense scrutiny and the public is demanding answers that no one has yet been willing to give.Also Read: Candace Owens reignites explosive France controversy after reposting viral “terrorist state” claim","Candace Owens claims Charlie Kirk warned of his impending death to a donor and TPUSA staff the night before he died.

Charlie Kirk Killing Firestorm: Owens Goes To War With TPUSA; Live Showdown Confirmed

Charlie Kirk assassination facts, FBI findings , and Erika Kirk’s response





Candace Owens has stirred strong reactions online after accusing Erika Kirk of helping hide key details connected to the assassination of Charlie Kirk . Her claims came just as an old and emotional video of Charlie Kirk with his then-fiancée, Erika, started trending again on social media. The clip comes from The Charlie Kirk Show. It shows Charlie Kirk walking into a room to interview Erika Kirk. As soon as he sits close to her, she blushes, laughs, and admits she is unable to focus.“I’m not going to be able to focus, sitting this close to him,” Erika says in the video. “I’m just gonna be staring at you [Charlie].”Charlie Kirk then smiles and tries to continue the interview. Erika later calls the moment “mortifying” and struggles to introduce herself. The short video has now crossed 3.7 million views on X, formerly Twitter, with many users calling it a real and honest moment between the couple. At the same time, Candace Owens shared posts on X accusing Erika Kirk of allowing a Turning Point USA livestream that pushed conspiracy theories about Charlie Kirk’s death. Candace Owens also claimed that Erika Kirk approved a letter linked to those theories. One widely shared post came from the X account run by Max Nordau.Candace Owens pointed to odd details, including people in maroon shirts and claims of foreign tracking. However, she did not provide any verified evidence to support these claims.Charlie Kirk was shot and killed on September 10 at Utah Valley University, according to police records. Authorities later arrested 22-year-old Tyler Robinson, who now faces charges for the shooting.The FBI stated clearly that Robinson acted alone. Investigators said his actions were driven by anger toward Charlie Kirk’s political views. The FBI also confirmed there were no foreign connections and no insider involvement, directly contradicting the claims shared online.Since the incident, Erika Kirk has focused on forgiveness and leadership. She has served as Turning Point USA CEO since 2022 and has avoided making aggressive public claims about the case.Earlier this week, Erika Kirk shared another personal video on social media. It showed Charlie Kirk telling their daughter the story of how he met Erika at Bill’s Burgers in New York City in 2018.“Story time: We’re at Bill’s Burgers in New York City, and right near this very table was the first time Dada met Mama,” Charlie Kirk says in the clip. The video received nearly 66 million views and more than 4.7 million likes. Erika Kirk captioned it, “my favorite love story.”Charlie Kirk and Erika Kirk later married in 2021. As the old interview clip spreads, many online say it shows a loving moment, even as public debate around Candace Owens’ claims continues.Also Read: Tim Pool reports shooting at his house as podcast stirs storm over Erika Kirk divorce and Charlie Kirk gay talk","Candace Owens has stirred strong reactions online after accusing Erika Kirk of helping hide key details connected to Charlie Kirk's assassination.

Fed call ahead: Central bank eyes third rate cut amid sharp divisions; why follow-up easing looks uncertain,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/fed-call-ahead-central-bank-eyes-third-rate-cut-amid-sharp-divisions-why-follow-up-easing-looks-uncertain/articleshow/125875291.cms,"The US Federal Reserve is widely expected to lower borrowing costs this week, but deep divisions within the policy-making panel suggest further rate cuts will be harder to secure, analysts say.Policymakers are set to meet on December 9–10 amid a complicated economic backdrop, with inflation still running above the Fed’s 2% target even as hiring weakens and unemployment rises. Economists expect Chair Jerome Powell to back a quarter-point cut — the third this year — though dissent is likely to be unusually high, AP reported.Some analysts believe as many as three officials could vote against the cut, marking the most dissenting votes in six years. Only 12 of the Fed’s 19 rate-setting committee members vote on decisions, and several non-voting officials have also expressed opposition to further easing.“It’s just a really tricky time. Perfectly sensible people can reach different answers,” William English, economist at Yale School of Management and former senior Fed staffer, said, highlighting the challenge of building consensus.The debate has been complicated by sparse official data following the prolonged US government shutdown, which delayed employment and inflation readings.Inflation pressures would normally argue against rate cuts, while signs of labour market weakness point in the opposite direction.Most economists now expect a “hawkish cut” — a rate reduction accompanied by guidance suggesting the Fed may pause to assess economic conditions. Financial markets are increasingly focused on the tone of Powell’s commentary rather than the cut itself.Kansas City Fed president Jeffrey Schmid is expected to dissent again in favour of holding rates steady, potentially joined by St. Louis Fed president Alberto Musalem. Fed governor Stephen Miran may oppose the quarter-point move and instead argue for a larger half-point reduction.Expectations of a December cut firmed after New York Fed president John Williams said the recent rise in inflation appeared to be a temporary effect linked to tariffs, and that he still saw “room for a further adjustment” in rates. Market-implied odds of a cut now stand at about 89%, according to CME Fedwatch.Powell’s leadership is also being tested politically, as President Donald Trump has repeatedly criticised the Fed chair and signalled that a new chair will be appointed when Powell’s term ends in May.While concerns about unemployment — which rose to 4.4% in September — are driving support for a December cut, economists caution that additional easing will depend on upcoming data. The Fed will review a backlog of jobs and inflation reports before its next meeting in January, which could either justify further cuts or compel a pause.","The US Federal Reserve is widely expected to lower borrowing costs this week.

US jobs pulse: Openings stay near 7.7 million in October; layoffs hit highest level since early 2023,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-jobs-pulse-openings-stay-near-7-7-million-in-october-layoffs-hit-highest-level-since-early-2023/articleshow/125874223.cms,"Photo credit- AP

US job openings showed little movement in October, signalling a cooling labour market at a time when the Federal Reserve is weighing another interest-rate cut amid mixed economic cues.Employers posted 7.67 million vacancies in October, almost unchanged from 7.66 million in September, according to the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) released by the Labor Department on Tuesday. Job openings have been steadily declining since peaking at a record 12.1 million in March 2022, as higher interest rates dampened hiring momentum, AP reported.The data also showed that layoffs rose to nearly 1.9 million, the highest level since January 2023, while the number of people quitting their jobs — often seen as a measure of worker confidence — fell. This trend suggests that employers seeking to control labour costs may increasingly rely on layoffs rather than natural attrition, Pantheon Macroeconomics’ chief US economist Samuel Tombs said.The JOLTS release was delayed and combined with revised September data due to a 43-day federal government shutdown, which disrupted economic reporting. The shutdown also forced the Labour Department to skip publishing a standalone unemployment rate for October.The figures come as policymakers at the US Federal Reserve meet this week to decide on interest rates. Inflation remains above the Fed’s 2% target, partly due to tariff-related price pressures, but recent softness in the job market has strengthened expectations that the Fed will cut rates for the third time this year, though dissent among policymakers is possible.The Labour Department is scheduled to release hiring and unemployment data for November next week, later than originally planned. Forecasters surveyed by FactSet expect employers to have added fewer than 38,000 jobs, with the unemployment rate edging up to 4.5%, which would still be low by historical standards but the highest in nearly four years, according to AP.","Employers posted 7.67 million vacancies in October, almost unchanged from 7.66 million in September.

Europe's auto market: Renault & Ford join hands to counter Chinese automakers; 'in a fight for our lives',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/europes-auto-market-renault-ford-join-hands-to-counter-chinese-automakers-in-a-fight-for-our-lives/articleshow/125870585.cms,"Renault and Ford have announced a new partnership aimed at jointly developing small, low-cost electric vehicles and commercial vans for the European market, in an effort to reduce production costs and defend their market share against fast-growing Chinese automakers.Speaking to reporters in Paris on Monday ahead of the announcement, Ford CEO Jim Farley underlined the urgency facing legacy manufacturers. ""We know we're in a fight for our lives in our industry,"" he said, referring to the mounting pressure from more affordable Chinese electric models.""There is no better example than here in Europe,"" Reuters cited.Europe’s established carmakers are facing an influx of competition, with brands such as BYD, Changan and Xpeng expanding rapidly across the region.Under the partnership, the first of two planned compact electric vehicles, designed by Ford and built at a Renault factory in northern France, is scheduled to arrive in European showrooms in 2028. These models will be smaller than any EVs Ford plans to sell in the United States and are expected to fill a major gap in the brand’s European lineup.The agreement also extends to commercial vehicles, with both companies set to co-develop Renault- and Ford-branded vans for Europe.Farley described the collaboration as a strategic way to strengthen their position in the light commercial vehicle segment. ""Together we can create a powerhouse of LCV in Europe that would be very difficult for the Chinese to compete with,"" he said.Although few Chinese van brands have reached Europe so far, Farley argued that the threat is already present. ""We compete with them directly every day"" in emerging markets, he said.Renault CEO Francois Provost echoed the concern, warning that competition will intensify. ""The Chinese will come soon and that's why I don't want to wait,"" he said. The partnership emerged after a Renault team visited Ford’s headquarters in Detroit in March, and both Farley and Provost stressed that the arrangement does not signal a merger, Reuters reported.Ford has been losing ground in Europe, with its passenger car market share dropping from 6.1% in 2019 to 3.3% in the first 10 months of this year, following a pullback from passenger vehicle sales. As part of recent restructuring efforts, the company has cut jobs and shut down its Saarlouis plant in Germany earlier this year.The automaker also faces high investment pressures at home, as the withdrawal of EV incentives under U.S. President Donald Trump forces Ford to continue investing in both combustion-engine models and expensive new electric vehicle technology. Leveraging Renault’s EV platforms, paired with Ford’s own designs, is expected to ease the financial strain and improve competitiveness in Europe.Ford already builds two EV models in Europe on a Volkswagen platform and produces vans with the German manufacturer. Farley noted that the new collaboration with Renault will operate alongside its current partnership with Volkswagen. Renault also has joint van programmes with Nissan and Volvo Group.For Renault, the tie-up strengthens manufacturing scale at a critical moment. As Europe’s smallest mainstream automaker and without a presence in China or the United States, the company has been actively seeking partnerships to make better use of its factories and reduce the cost burden of developing new electric models.The French manufacturer is set to produce two vehicles in Brazil in 2026 using platforms from China’s Geely and is in discussions with additional carmakers, including China’s Chery, to jointly produce and sell vehicles.Provost said Renault remains determined to prove that Europe can stay competitive in electric vehicle manufacturing. ""Our ambition... is to show that in Europe we can produce EV cars in Europe as competitively as anyone, including the Chinese,"" he said.","Ford and Renault will jointly develop electric vehicles and commercial vans for Europe. The move is an effort to reduce production costs and defend their market share against fast-growing Chinese automakers.

Hundreds of H-1B and H-4 visa appointments scheduled for mid- to late-December 2025 are being cancelled and pushed to March 2026 as US consulates overhaul screening procedures, according to immigration firm Fragomen, according to an ET report.Consular posts have cited a new mandatory online presence review for H-1B applicants and their dependents that comes into effect on December 15. Under the revised process, applicants will be required to make their social media accounts publicly accessible for assessment by visa officers.Fragomen said email correspondence from US consulates confirms that interview slots are being reduced to accommodate the expanded vetting process. As a result, posts are cancelling previously scheduled interviews to align with slower daily processing under the new system.“Applicant biometrics appointments abroad are not being cancelled; biometrics are being taken at the scheduled time, but applicants are then informed that their visa appointment will be rescheduled to a later date, sometimes by several months,” the firm said, ET quoted.While aimed at strengthening background checks, the expanded scrutiny introduces additional procedural steps that are expected to delay approvals and potentially deter prospective applicants.The changes come against the backdrop of broader H-1B policy tightening by the US government. Earlier in 2025, new H-1B modernisation rules redefined what qualifies as a specialty occupation, tightened degree relevance requirements and raised compliance expectations for employers, increasing scrutiny of new petitions.Further uncertainty was added in September 2025 with the announcement of a one-time $100,000 fee for all new H-1B petitions. While continuing-employment petitions are exempt, the higher cost is expected to influence hiring and onsite deployment strategies, particularly for Indian IT services firms.Immigration attorneys and industry stakeholders in both India and the US have flagged concerns over the cumulative impact of higher costs, narrower occupational definitions and expanded background checks, signalling a long-term shift in how employers approach H-1B workforce planning.","Hundreds of H-1B and H-4 visa appointments scheduled for mid- to late-December 2025 are being cancelled and pushed to March 2026.

China looks to diversify

US President Donald Trump has given the green signal to tech giant Nvidia to sell its H200 processors to China. The Trump administration has decided to permit exports of Nvidia's H200 processors, their second-best AI chips, to China whilst implementing a 25% tariff on such shipments.This resolves a discussion regarding whether American firms should maintain their AI chip market dominance through Chinese sales or restrict exports, although Beijing has instructed companies to avoid US technology, creating uncertainty about potential new sales.According to a Reuters report, Nvidia's stock went up by 2% in after-hours trading following Trump's Truth Social announcement, building upon a 3% gain during regular trading hours after Semafor's initial report.Trump indicated he had discussed this decision with Chinese President Xi Jinping, who reportedly gave a ""positive response"" regarding the scrutiny of Nvidia chips in China.The US Commerce Department is completing the arrangement details, which will extend to other AI chip manufacturers like Advanced Micro Devices and Intel.The White House confirmed Trump's intended fee as 25%, higher than August's suggested 15% rate.""We will protect National Security, create American Jobs, and keep America's lead in AI,"" Trump wrote on Truth Social. ""NVIDIA's US Customers are already moving forward with their incredible, highly advanced Blackwell chips, and soon, Rubin, neither of which are part of this deal.""The announcement lacked specifics about H200 chip export quantities or conditions, only stating that exports would proceed ""under conditions that allow for continued strong National Security.""Government officials view this decision as a balanced approach between restricting Nvidia's latest Blackwell technology exports to China and maintaining some level of US chip presence to counter Huawei's growing influence in China's AI chip market, according to an informed source.""Offering H200 to approved commercial customers, vetted by the Department of Commerce, strikes a thoughtful balance that is great for America,"" Nvidia stated.A White House representative explained that the 25% fee would be levied as an import duty when the chips travel from Taiwan to the United States for security assessment before their onward journey to China.Security experts in Washington express concerns that providing advanced AI chips to China could enhance their military capabilities, which initially prompted the Biden administration to implement export restrictions.""It's a terrible mistake to trade off national security for advantages in trade,"" stated Eric Hirschhorn, a former Commerce Department official during Obama's presidency. ""It cuts against the consistent policies of Democratic and Republican administrations alike not to assist China's military modernisation.""The Institute for Progress (IFP), a non-partisan research organisation, released findings indicating the H200 would deliver nearly six times the processing power of the H20, currently China's legally permitted most advanced AI semiconductor, following Trump's administration's reversal of its brief export prohibition this year.The upgraded Blackwell chip utilised by American AI companies delivers 1.5 times enhanced training speed compared to H200 chips, according to IFP, whilst offering five times faster inferencing capabilities. Nvidia's research indicates Blackwell chips perform certain tasks ten times quicker than H200 chips.Several Democratic senators criticised Trump's decision as a ""colossal economic and national security failure"", suggesting it would benefit Chinese industry and military advancement.House China Select Committee Chairman, Republican Representative John Moolenaar, expressed concerns to Reuters about China's potential use of these chips for military and surveillance purposes.China's growing determination to reduce dependence on Nvidia's chips coincides with this approval. In July, Chinese cybersecurity regulators raised concerns about possible security vulnerabilities in H20 chips, which Nvidia has contested.Beijing has advised Chinese technology firms against purchasing modified Nvidia chips, including H20, RTX 6000D and L20 models, according to two sources.The H200 policy revision occurred simultaneously with Trump's Justice Department revealing a China-connected chip smuggling operation that handled approximately $160 million worth of restricted Nvidia H100 and H200 chips during late 2024 and early 2025.Former US State Department technology expert Chris McGuire suggests Chinese organisations would likely continue purchasing H200s, given their superior performance compared to domestic alternatives.China's domestic AI chip sector includes prominent manufacturer Huawei Technologies, which released a three-year strategic plan in September, alongside smaller firms like Cambricon and Moore Threads.",US President Donald Trump has given the green signal to tech giant Nvidia to sell its H200 processors to China. Trump indicated he had discussed this decision with Chinese President Xi Jinping.

Chinese soybean purchases lag behind expectations





Aid offers relief, not security

New scrutiny on food supply chain pricing

US President Donald Trump on Monday unveiled a $12 billion relief package for American farmers, aiming to soften the financial blow of the ongoing trade war with China, which has driven up production costs and slashed crop sales. The announcement was made at the White House during a roundtable meeting attended by agriculture secretary Brooke Rollins, lawmakers from key farming states, and growers grappling with tariff-induced market losses.Farmers who attended the meeting told Trump that they see the relief as a crucial lifeline.“With this bridge payment, we’ll be able to farm another year,” Iowa farmer Cordt Holub said as the president unveiled the plan.Rollins said the aid includes $11 billion earmarked for one-time payments to row-crop producers, and an additional $1 billion reserved for specialty crop support while officials study the specific pressures on those farmers. She said the money should start reaching growers before the end of February.Trump said tariff revenue will supply the funds, adding, “We looked at how they were hurt, to what extent they were hurt,” AP cited.A USDA formula based on estimated production costs is set to determine payments later this month, with compensation calculated per acre and capped at $155,000 per farm or individual. The programme excludes anyone earning more than $900,000 a year, a limit that will block the largest commercial farms from receiving the biggest payouts, an issue that drew criticism during Trump’s first term.The political stakes are high. Farmers have been among Trump’s core supporters, yet the volatility of his tariff decisions and the effect on agricultural markets have fuelled frustration. The White House has positioned this latest package as part of its defence of Trump’s handling of the broader economy. He is scheduled to travel to Pennsylvania on Tuesday to speak about affordability, an issue that has increasingly shaped voter concerns.Soybeans and sorghum have suffered the largest blow from the trade conflict because more than half of their annual production normally goes overseas, predominantly to China. Following a meeting between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea in October, the White House said Beijing had pledged to purchase at least 12 million metric tonnes of US soybeans by the year’s end and 25 million metric tonnes annually for the next three years. China already holds the title of the world’s biggest soybean buyer, though it has been expanding its procurement from Brazil and other South American exporters.Since Trump announced the agreement at the end of October, China has purchased just over 2.8 million metric tonnes, around a quarter of the volume administration officials originally said would be bought. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has insisted China is still on pace to meet the target, though not until the end of February, two months later than the White House first signalled.The scale of the $12 billion aid package is roughly equivalent to the total value of US soybean exports to China in 2024, and about half of all US agricultural exports to China that year.Farmers say the government support is welcome but emphasise that it cannot resolve the core structural challenge of soaring costs and unpredictable markets. Trump authorised more than $22 billion in farming aid in 2019 at the start of the trade dispute and nearly $46 billion in 2020, though that total included pandemic-related assistance.“That’s a start, but I think we need to be looking for some avenues to find other funding opportunities and we need to get our markets going. That’s where we want to be able to make a living from,” Caleb Ragland, a Kentucky grower and president of the American Soybean Association told AP.Farmers who rent most of the land they work are in the most vulnerable position because they lack equity to borrow against. The risk is that, if smaller producers cannot stay afloat this year, consolidation within the industry could intensify.Iowa farmer Robb Ewoldt owns only 160 of the 2,000 acres he cultivates and has begun selling non-essential machinery and considering overnight trucking work to generate more income. “It is to the point where I don’t want to saddle my kid with the kind of stress that my wife and I are under right now,” he said.Others remain hopeful that most farms will endure. Minnesota farmer Darin Johnson, whose family operation stretches back four generations, said, “A lot of farms are pretty well-established and they have the equity to be able to still keep borrowing money to get through tougher times like this.”Trump is also facing mounting pressure to act on surging beef prices. He has publicly accused foreign-owned meat packers of artificially inflating prices and has asked the Department of Justice to investigate, although he has not supplied evidence to support his claims.On Saturday, he signed an executive order authorising the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission to examine “anti-competitive behaviour” in food supply chains, including fertiliser, seed and equipment, and to consider enforcement or regulatory action where needed.","US President Donald Trump on Monday unveiled a $12 billion relief package for American farmers, aiming to soften the financial blow of the ongoing trade war with China.

Paramount makes $108.4bn hostile bid for Warner Bros,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/paramount-makes-108-4bn-hostile-bid-for-warner-bros/articleshow/125861585.cms,"Netflix Drops A $72b Bombshell On Hollywood With Mega Warner Bros Discovery Move | WHAT IT MEANS

Paramount Skydance on Monday launched a hostile bid worth $108.4 billion for Warner Bros Discovery, in a last-ditch effort to outbid Netflix and create a media powerhouse that would challenge the dominance of the streaming giant.Netflix had emerged victorious on Friday from a weekslong bidding war with Paramount and Comcast, securing a $72 billion equity deal for Warner Bros Discovery’s TV, film studios and streaming assets. But Paramount’s latest bid means the jockeying for Warner Bros and its prized HBO and DC Comics assets will not come to a conclusion swiftly.Paramount’s $30-per-share cash offer includes financing from Affinity Partners, the investment firm run by Jared Kushner, US President Donald Trump’s son-in-law, the Saudi and Qatari sovereign wealth funds, and L’imad Holding Co, owned by the govt of Abu Dhabi, and is backstopped by the Ellison family.Larry Ellison, the world's second-richest person, is the father of Paramount head David Ellison and has close ties to the White House. The studio argues its bid for the entirety of Warner Bros Discovery is superior to Netflix’s bid, providing shareholders $18 billion more in cash and an easier path to regulatory approval. It also argued that Paramount Warner Bros combination would be in the best interest of the creative community, movie theatres and consumers, who would benefit from enhanced competition.“We believe our offer will create a stronger Hollywood,” Paramount CEO David Ellison said in a statement. Ellison said on several occasions on MondayParamount’s bid includes Warner Bros Discovery’s cable television properties; Netflix’s bid is limited to the Warner Bros film and television studios, HBO and the HBO Max streaming service.Analysts noted that Paramount’s offer comes with its own antitrust scrutiny as a consolidation of two major television operators. Last month, Democratic senators warned that such a transaction would result in “one company controlling almost everything Americans watch on TV.” The combined studio would also have a greater market share than current leader Walt Disney Co, and add to fears of consolidation that have hit the industry hard in recent years. The offer represents a 139% premium over the company’s undisturbed stock price, and bests Netflix’s $27.75 offer that mixes cash and stock. Warner Bros Discovery and Netflix did not immediately respond to requests for comments on Paramount’s deal.

More funding for Pakistan! IMF gives green signal to $1.2 billion tranche; cites ‘macroeconomic stability’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/more-funding-for-pakistan-imf-gives-green-signal-to-1-2-billion-tranche-cites-macroeconomic-stability/articleshow/125858590.cms,"'Tell The World, Expose Pak': Ex-General's Big Advice After Pakistani Leader's Delhi Blast Claim

IMF on Monday approved a disbursement of around $1.2 billion to Pakistan, lifting the country’s total inflows under the Extended Fund Facility and the Resilience and Sustainability Facility to roughly $3.3 billion. The IMF Executive Board cleared the payment during its meeting in Washington, citing the country’s efforts in macroeconomic reforms.Pakistan remains heavily reliant on external financing. The country narrowly avoided default in 2023, helped by a $7 billion IMF bailout in 2024, and is now one of the Fund’s biggest borrowers after Argentina and Ukraine. It also entered a 10-year, $20 billion financing arrangement with the World Bank in January.IMF deputy managing director Nigel Clarke said that the country’s policy implementation had remained consistent with programme goals, even after floods during the recent monsoon season killed more than 1,000 people by September.The Board further added that the strength of the reform drive had helped maintain financial stability and improve external conditions despite the shock.Clarke said ""the implementation of reforms in Pakistan has helped to preserve macroeconomic stability despite recent shocks"".Pointing to summer floods in the country, the IMF said, ""the authorities' commitment to meeting their primary balance target while providing the necessary emergency assistance in response to these severe floods is an important signal of their willingness to strengthen their credibility in fiscal policy"".As part of the review, the Fund highlighted Pakistan’s fiscal performance, noting a primary surplus of 1.3% of GDP in FY25, in line with programme expectations. The IMF reported that gross reserves reached $14.5 billion at the end of FY25, compared with $9.4 billion a year earlier, and are forecast to expand through FY26 and beyond, the Dawn reported. The Board acknowledged that inflation had risen due to flood-driven food price spikes but described the pressure as temporary.Clarke warned that a sustained reform effort would be necessary to secure medium-term growth that is led by the private sector. He emphasised the need “advancing reforms to raise revenues via tax policy simplification and base broadening”, noting that fiscal resilience is essential for investments in climate adaptation, social protection, human development and public infrastructure.He further underlined the energy sector as a priority, stating that “reforms in the energy sector are critical to safeguarding its viability and improving Pakistan’s competitiveness”, and that while power tariff adjustments had “helped reduce the stock and flow of circular debt”, subsequent steps must focus on lowering electricity production and distribution costs and addressing inefficiencies in both the power and gas sectors.The climate-related RSF tranche is aimed at supporting Pakistan’s wider resilience and disaster-preparedness framework. Clarke said it backs work to “strengthen natural disaster response and financing coordination, improve the use of scarce water resources, raise climate considerations in project selection and budgeting, and improve the information on climate-related risks in financing decisions”. The Board said the scale of the recent floods demonstrates why climate reforms must be accelerated, and reported that Pakistan is making progress on these fronts with RSF support, the Dawn reported.The IMF noted the publication of the Governance and Corruption Diagnostic Assessment, describing it as “a welcome step in accelerating governance reforms”.","IMF on Monday approved a disbursement of around $1.2 billion to Pakistan.

Paramount vs Netflix: What’s at stake in Hollywood

Market reaction

NEW DELHI: Paramount has launched a $108 billion hostile bid to acquire Warner Bros Discovery (WBD), directly appealing to shareholders just days after WBD agreed to be acquired by Netflix. The move sets up a rare, high-stakes media battle that could reshape global entertainment.The offer, announced late Monday, comes from Paramount and its CEO David Ellison , who told CNBC the bid aims “to finish what we started.” The all-cash offer of $30 per share is pitched as a more secure alternative to Netflix’s $27.75-per-share proposal made last week.Paramount argues its bid “provides shareholders $18 billion more in cash than the Netflix consideration” and offers “a quicker path to completion,” according to an official statement.Netflix agreed on Friday to buy WBD’s studios and HBO Max after the entertainment giant splits into two companies. Paramount accused Warner of failing to “meaningfully engage” despite submitting six takeover proposals in 12 weeks. The company signalled it is prepared for a prolonged tender battle, despite having a much smaller market value of around $14 billion, compared to Netflix’s $400+ billion.Also read: Warner Bros-Netflix deal - Is the Tudum effect harmful for Indian cinema? 'The risk is two-fold' The Paramount bid is backed by the Ellison family, RedBird Capital, and $54 billion in debt commitments from Bank of America, Citi and Apollo.Paramount warned WBD shareholders that Netflix’s takeover is unlikely to clear global regulators. Netflix, however, has included a $5.8 billion breakup fee in its terms, signalling confidence. Co-CEO Ted Sarandos said he is “highly confident” the deal will be approved.US President Donald Trump weighed in, telling reporters the Netflix deal “could be a problem” due to market dominance and adding, “I’ll be involved in that decision.”If Warner backs out of the Netflix deal to accept another offer, it must pay $2.8 billion to Netflix.Whoever wins will control some of the most valuable franchises in entertainment, including HBO, Harry Potter, DC Comics, and CNN. If Netflix succeeds, analysts say it will cement the company’s control over Hollywood content and accelerate disruptions to theatres and artificial intelligence-driven filmmaking.If Paramount prevails, Warner would become part of a media empire led by Ellison and Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, who are also positioned to take control of TikTok’s U.S. operations under a deal championed by Trump.Warner shares closed at $26.08, below Netflix’s offer price, signalling investor doubt the deal will close. Paramount shares fell nearly 10%, an unusual move as shareholders typically celebrate avoiding massive acquisition costs.The bidding war could escalate, say analysts, noting similar competitive takeovers have occurred only when exceptionally coveted assets hit the market.","Paramount has launched a $108 billion hostile bid to acquire Warner Bros Discovery.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying"".However, a report released by the State Bank of India (SBI) economists on Tuesday dismissed arguments that India is dangerously close to Hindu rate of growth saying such statements are ""ill-conceived, biased and premature"".The term 'Hindu growth rate' was coined by late economist Raj Krishna in 1978 to describe the slow growth in the country.It basically refers to the low pace of economic growth rates during 1950s to 1980s. During this period, the Indian economy averaged 3.5%.A former lecturer at the Delhi School of Economics (DSE), Krishna noted that only if the rate of growth is persistently slow and accompanied by low per-capita GDP, then it will be known as Hindu rate of growth but it has to factor in population growth as well.Before economic reforms of 1991, India's economic growth remained stagnant and low, while per capita income averaged around 1.3%.Krishna termed this low growth situation to be a result of socialist policies of state control and import substitution.However, the economic situation changed when liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation (LPG) reforms came into effect in the year 1991, at a time when India faced balance of payment crisis.Over the years, many economists have strongly opposed the idea of 'Hindu growth rate' and the term never had universal acceptance.The Indian economy plunged into its very first technical recession in FY21 due to the impact of Covid-19 pandemic and the related nationwide lockdowns. GDP shrunk by an unprecedented 23.8% in the first quarter of the financial year 2020-21. However, due to spurt in economic activities in the subsequent quarters, the GDP decline started to narrow.However, if we look at the period before Covid-19 as well, India's growth curve shows a declining trend.From 8.26% in FY17, GDP growth plunged to 3.74% in FY20. Shutdown of economic activities in FY21 in wake of Covid-19 only made matters worse.As lockdowns started to ease and business activities resumed, India's GDP also started rising. In Q1 of FY22, growth jumped to 20.1% mainly on account of low base effect. By the fourth quarter of FY22, growth came down to 4.10%.Similarly, the new financial year 2022-23 brought fresh economic challenges in the form of Russia-Ukraine war that impacted almost all major economies of the world, slowed the pace of growth, pushed inflation to record highs.As a result, the central banks of all advanced economies spurred into action and opted for monetary policy tightening to curb the soaring inflation.With persistently rising interest rates, India's economy grew by 4.4% in Q3 of FY23, as the Centre revised upwards GDP growth for previous year to 9.10% from 8.7% earlier.The report weighed recent GDP numbers against the available data on savings and investments for the past decade and highlighted some interesting points.""Quarterly growth numbers are noisy and should be best avoided for any serious interpretation (on an average, India's GDP growth has witnessed Rs 2 lakh crore upward revision for the 3 year ended FY23),"" the report said.Gross capital formation (GCF) by the government touched a high of 11.8% in 2021-22, up from 10.7% in 2020-21.""This also had a domino effect on private sector investment that jumped from 10 per cent to 10.8% over the same period,"" it said.In fact, Ecowrap added that the trends in GCF to gross output ratio or the plough back of funds for creation of fresh capacity shows that for public administration the ratio attained fresh peak in 2021-22 owing to the emphasis on capital expenditure in recent budgets.At the aggregate level, gross capital formation is supposed to have crossed 32% in 2022-23, the highest level since 2018-19.According to the report, in 2021-22, gross savings have risen to 30% from 29% in 2020-21.""The ratio is supposed to have crossed 31 per cent in 2022-23, the highest since 2018-19. The household savings increased sharply during the pandemic period on account of sharp accretion in financial savings such as deposits,"" said the report by SBI's Economic Research Department.While household financial savings have since then moderated from 15.4% in 2020-21 to 11.1% in 2022-23, savings in physical assets have grown sharply to 11.8% in 2021-22 from 10.7% in 2020-21.The report further analysed Incremental Capital Output ratio (ICOR) -- which measures additional units of capital (investment) needed to produce additional units of output. It said that the ratio has been improving.""ICOR which was 7.5 in FY 12 is now only 3.5 in FY22. Clearly, only half of capital is now needed for next unit of output,"" the report noted.Such reducing ICOR in the current years reflects a relatively increasing efficiency of capital and shows that the economy is on a sound footing, the report said.""From that point of view, future GDP growth rates even at 7% could still mean a decent number by any standards!,"" it added.","India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.

"Find less costly ways to address pension concerns instead of OPS, says Raghuram Rajan",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/find-less-costly-ways-to-address-pension-concerns-instead-of-ops-says-raghuram-rajan/articleshow/98457871.cms,"NEW DELHI: Former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan has expressed his concern over the decision of some states to restart the old pension scheme and suggested that some less costly ways should be found to address the demands of government pensioners.Rajan further said the old pension scheme does involve massive future outlays because of the indexation of pensions to current salaries.""This is an enormous obligation, not necessarily in the short run, but in the long run,"" he said, adding obviously, state governments have to think through the long-term implications for government finances, and whether civil servants are the most in need of help among the constituencies they deal with.Rajan, currently Katherine Dusak Miller Distinguished Service Professor of Finance at The University of Chicago Booth School of Business, said as he understands it, it may be infeasible technically or legally to move back to the old pension scheme.""If so, there may be less costly ways of addressing the concerns that prompt such moves,"" Rajan told PTI in an email interview.In a major move, a select group of central government employees have been given a one-time option to opt for old pension scheme.The employees who joined the central government services against posts advertised or notified before December 22, 2003, the day National Pension System ( NPS ) was notified, are eligible to join the old pension scheme under the Central Civil Services (Pension) Rules, 1972 (now 2021).Under Old Pension Scheme (OPS), employees get a defined pension. An employee is entitled for a 50 per cent amount of the last drawn salary as pension.OPS was discontinued by the NDA government in 2003 with effect from April 1, 2004.Under the new pension scheme (NPS), employees contribute 10 per cent of their basic salary towards pension while the government contributes 14 per cent.Governments of Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand have informed the central government/ Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA about their decision to restart OPS for their employees.The government of Punjab on November 18, 2022, issued a notification regarding implementation of OPS for the state government employees who are being covered under NPS. Jharkhand too has decided to revert to OPS.",Former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan has expressed his concern over the decision of some states to restart the old pension scheme. He suggested that some less costly ways should be found to address the demands of government pensioners.

"‘Not a good indicator, what counts is…’: India overtaking Japan to be 4th largest economy no reason to be smug; WEF ex-MD serves reality check",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/not-a-good-indicator-what-counts-is-india-overtaking-japan-to-be-4th-largest-economy-no-reason-to-be-smug-wef-ex-md-serves-reality-check/articleshow/121706941.cms,"For India to achieve its goal of becoming a $ 7-trillion economy by 2030, the country needs to strengthen its industrial sector, according to Smadja. (AI image)

India overtaking Japan to become the fourth largest economy soon is not something to be complacent about, World Economic Forum’s (WEF) former MD Claude Smadja has said. Giving a reality check, Claude Smadja has pointed to India’s abysmal per capita GDP numbers, comparing them to how poorly they fare to Japan’s per capita income.India’s GDP ($4,187 billion) is set to surpass that of Japan ($4,186 billion) by the end of this year (FY26), according to the IMF's latest World Economic Outlook report. However, the IMF statistics from April 2025 also reveal that India's GDP per capita stands at $2,878.4, which is roughly 8.5% of Japan's $33,955.7. This means that people in Japan earn approximately 11.8 times more than their Indian counterparts!""Yes, it (economy size) is a good indicator because it gives a notion of the economic weight of the country on the global balance. No, it is not a good indicator because what counts is the per capita GDP. In terms of per capita GDP, India is far below Japan. So whether India has achieved this fourth position in the global economic balance... is a good indicator of progress being made, but it is not in any way any reason for complacency,"" Smadja said in his conversation with PTI.In fact, Smadja emphasised that India's enhanced economic position should drive faster reforms, ensuring improved living conditions across all societal segments, beyond just the expanding middle class in both urban and rural regions.The youthful demographic of India remains a significant advantage, but Smadja highlighted the critical requirement to enhance skill development and retraining across the workforce.For India to achieve its goal of becoming a $ 7-trillion economy by 2030, the country needs to strengthen its industrial sector, according to Smadja.He pointed out that manufacturing's contribution to India's GDP is approximately half of China's level. He considers this proportion inadequate considering India's geographical size, population, and economic capabilities.Without substantial growth in manufacturing activities, India's aspirations to reach the $7-trillion economic milestone remain challenging, according to Smadja.Smadja, who heads Smadja and Smadja Strategic Advisory, spoke of India's crucial position in the global technology landscape. He noted the country's exceptional advantage in big data management, which he believes should be safeguarded and utilised effectively to elevate India's status in worldwide technology and innovation.Also Read | Extreme poverty in India sees sharp decline! Number dips from 344.47 million to 75.24 million; poverty rate down to 5.3%, says World Bank He emphasised that India ranks amongst the primary data producers globally, alongside China, Europe, and the US.According to him, India's unique circumstances stem from its widespread internet connectivity, extensive mobile phone usage, and the national ""Aadhaar"" identification system, resulting in substantial data generation that encompasses all aspects of everyday living.In India, safeguarding this vital strategic resource is crucial as it serves as the foundation for advancing technological innovation, fostering breakthroughs in disruptive technologies, and establishing itself amongst the world's leading big data powerhouses.Besides China, India stands alone in possessing such a substantial big data resource, according to Smadja.","India overtaking Japan to become the fourth largest economy soon is not something to be complacent about, World Economic Forum’s (WEF) former MD Claude Smadja has said.

Four public sector banks cut lending rates after RBI move,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/four-public-sector-banks-cut-lending-rates-after-rbi-move/articleshow/121713755.cms,"MUMBAI: Banks led by public sector lenders have started revising their lending rates following the RBI's 50 basis point repo rate cut . However, for a change, old borrowers may benefit more than new ones, as banks are likely to tweak the spreads on home loans, which were already competitive in the quest for market share. Bank of Baroda has reduced its repo-linked lending rate (RLLR) by 50 basis points with effect from June 7. The bank's RLLR now stands at 8.15%. Punjab National Bank has cut its RLLR by 50 basis points to 8.35%, effective June 9, while keeping its MCLR unchanged. Bank of India has also reduced its Repo-Based Lending Rate by 50 bps to 8.35% from June 6.UCO Bank trimmed both its MCLR and RLLR. The bank cut its RLLR by 50 bps to 8.30% from June 9 and lowered its MCLR by 10 bps across tenures. Its one-year MCLR now stands at 9%.HDFC Bank, meanwhile, reduced its MCLR by 10 basis points across tenure, starting June 7. With the reduction, the overnight and one-month rates are down by 10 basis points to 8.9%.According to RBI norms, floating-rate loans must be reset in line with the benchmark repo rate. This means existing borrowers will see an automatic reduction in rates. However, new borrowers may not get the full benefit, as banks are expected to adjust the spread they charge over the repo rate to protect margins.In the case of Bank of Baroda, home loan rates for new borrowers after the revision start at 8%.To preserve profitability, banks are also expected to lower returns on fixed deposits, especially with fresh liquidity being injected into the system. This could make FDs less attractive to savers.The reason why old borrowers will benefit more than new ones is that because of intense competition, many lenders particularly those who were challenging markets leaders, were offering cheaper rates. Among public sector banks, Bank of India, Bank of Maharashtra, Central Bank of India and Union Bank of India were offering loans at 7.85% for up to Rs 30 lakh even before the rate cut.Canara Bank, Indian Bank, Indian Overseas Bank and UCO Bank were offering home loans at 7.90%, with Canara's rate applicable for loans above Rs 75 lakh and others for loans up to Rs 30 lakh. Until last week, South Indian Bank had the lowest rate among private lenders at 8.30% for loans up to Rs 30 lakh. Karur Vysya Bank followed at 8.45%, while PNB Housing Finance and Tamilnad Mercantile Bank offered 8.50%. Bandhan Bank, Axis Bank and Karnataka Bank had rates of 8.66%, 8.75% and 8.78%, respectively.","Bank of Baroda has reduced its repo-linked lending rate (RLLR) by 50 basis points.

""We are trying to, of course, not impose higher pricing, unrealistic pricing to our airlines. But the good thing is, with our platform, we have the most cost-effective platform from an operating cost point of view of the regional market,"" he noted.For a domestic market with many short routes under an hour, ATR aircraft offer a cost-effective solution, making them ideal for such operations, he added.","ATR remains ""very bullish"" on the Indian market and is actively engaged in talks with some of the operators.

(AI image)

Manav Modi, Senior Analyst, Commodity Research at Motilal Oswal Financial services Ltd shares his outlook on gold prices and strategy for gold investors:

Strategy: Gold and Silver Buy on dips.

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market and other asset classes given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)

Gold price prediction today: Gold rates have seen major fluctuations over the last few weeks, ever since the yellow metal prices hit a lifetime high. Gold is seen as a safe haven investment in times of turmoil and uncertainty. The rapidly evolving geopolitical and trade situations have kept gold investors guessing on the direction of gold prices. So, what is the gold rate prediction for this week and what should investors do?Last week, Gold climbed to a near four-week high, while silver surged past ₹1 lakh on the domestic front, driven by a weakening dollar and escalating global uncertainty. Silver posted one the sharpest gains on daily and weekly basis, gaining 2.7% in the previous session, its strongest daily performance in over three weeks, as investors sought refuge amid concerns over the US-China trade deal.The upcoming trade discussions between US and China remains a key event for market direction. The European Commission is also urging the US to reduce tariffs, adding to the broader trade policy uncertainty.Meanwhile, geopolitical tensions intensified with Russia demanding territorial concessions from Ukraine to end the war. On the macro front, weaker-than-expected US manufacturing and services PMI data, coupled with disappointing private payrolls, raised concerns about stagflation.Still, the better-than-expected non-farm payroll data signalled resilience in the labour market, keeping investor sentiment mixed.Silver, after lagging behind gold, saw renewed interest due to improved fundamentals and technical momentum, pushing it to a 13-year high. The Gold/Silver ratio also dropped sharply, signalling silver’s relative strength.ETF inflows into silver added further support, reflecting growing investor appetite for the metal amid continued global economic and political instability. Focus this week will be on US and China CPI data.","Last week, Gold climbed to a near four-week high, while silver surged past ₹1 lakh on the domestic front.

The slowdown is attributed to ongoing volatility in the equity market due to a mix of global and domestic factors.This shift followed a remarkable 2024, in which 91 maiden public issues collectively raised Rs 1.6 lakh crore, driven by robust retail participation, a resilient economy, and booming private capital expenditure.Despite the cautious start to 2025, there are promising signs.

ITC bets on buyouts to grow food business,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/itc-bets-on-buyouts-to-grow-food-business/articleshow/121714097.cms,"NEW DELHI: After the recent acquisitions of Yoga Bar and 24 Mantra Organic, ITC Foods is sharpening its focus on strategic takeovers to accelerate growth, gain rapid entry into high-potential categories, and align with consumer preferences for health, indulgence, convenience, and premium offerings. This move aligns with the 'ITC Next' strategy, which prioritises value-accretive acquisitions as a core expansion driver, Hemant Malik, executive director, ITC, told TOI.The company plans to drive growth through a combination of brownfield and greenfield investments, navigating challenges of subdued urban consumption amid weak household incomes and spiralling inflation.During the year, there was severe inflationary pressure in edible oil, wheat, maida, cocoa, and packaging inputs, which, the company said, was partially mitigated through cost management initiatives, calibrated pricing actions, and a strategic push towards premiumisation.Malik expects the premium category to grow at least twice the pace of the overall FMCG business. ""We are creating offerings for the health-seeking new India, growing per capita India, Gen Z, as well as consumers seeking richer and new experiences. Many of them would have premium pricing. It's all about providing the right value to the consumers... Premium is not limited only to metros; there are premium customers across the country,"" he said.At present, around 30% of the ITC portfolio is premium products. The strategy seems to be paying off.

We are creating a lot of new products based on evolving consumer needs, for every life stage or cohort,"" Malik said.The food category still has significant headroom for growth - especially since a large part of it remains unbranded, according to Malik.","ITC Foods is sharpening its focus on strategic takeovers to accelerate growth.

Cognizant argued that Infosys has not presented evidence suggesting Kumar undermined the progress of its healthcare platform, Helix.Cognizant's legal team maintains that all claims advanced by Infosys pertain solely to Kumar's period at Infosys, not his tenure at Cognizant. The filing further asserts that Infosys's request for documents from Kumar's time at Cognizant-after raising concerns over trade secrets and invoking non-compete agreements-is without legal merit.Cognizant had acquired the healthcare software business TriZetto for $2.7 billion in 2014. TriZetto's flagship products, Facets and QNXT, process health insurance claims for millions across the US, relying on confidential trade secrets.

'Autopen is biggest political scandal in American history': Trump



Trump questions Biden's pardons



Here is a list of the former president's most controversial pardons:

Hunter Biden:

Biden pardons siblings:

Gen. Mark Milley, Dr Anthony Fauci:





The mechanical signature device known as the autopen, which received its first patent many years ago, has recently become a subject of political controversy due to US President Donald Trump 's assertions about Joe Biden 's alleged usage for signing pardons.Trump ordered an investigation Wednesday into whether former President Biden's administration used an autopen machine to sign key presidential documents like pardons.In a memo signed Wednesday night, Trump told Attorney General Pam Bondi and the president's counsel to probe what he claimed was a ""conspiracy"" to ""abuse the power of Presidential signatures through the use of an autopen to conceal Biden's cognitive decline.""An autopen is a mechanical device designed to recreate authentic signatures by physically manipulating a pen. Unlike stamps or digital signature prints, these machines can accommodate various writing instruments, from ballpoint pens to permanent markers, as listed in product specifications for commercially available autopens, Fox News reported.Contemporary autopen systems enable users to store signature patterns on portable devices like smart cards or USB drives for easy transfer to the machine.The signing process begins when a pen is inserted, and the signature is executed by pressing a button or using a foot pedal to activate the mechanism.In March, President Trump contested that if Biden employed an autopen for signing preemptive pardons for House select committee members who investigated the January 6, 2021, Capitol attack, those pardons would be considered ""void"" and ""vacant.""Earlier, President Trump reiterated his concerns on Truth Social, stating ""With the exception of the RIGGED PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION OF 2020, THE AUTOPEN IS THE BIGGEST POLITICAL SCANDAL IN AMERICAN HISTORY!!!""Interestingly, the device was also used to replicate a person’s signature and has been used by past presidents including Thomas Jefferson, John F Kennedy, and Barack Obama to sign ceremonial or routine documents when unavailable.The Heritage Foundation's Oversight Project, a conservative organisation, has also scrutinised this matter, suggesting that Biden's supposed autopen usage, considering his ""clear cognitive decline ... raises additional questions for investigators.""In his concluding weeks as president, Biden extended clemency and pardons to over 1,500 people, which his administration characterised as the most extensive single-day clemency action by any American president. Questioning Biden's mental acuity and decision-making authority, Trump asserted that he was unaware of the documents' contents when using the automated signing device. This raised concerns about his cognitive state during his presidency and his direct involvement in official decisions. administration.While Biden personally signed his son Hunter's pardon, the remaining pardons appear to have been executed using an autopen.In December 2024, former President Joe Biden issued a pardon to his son Hunter, contradicting his earlier promises to the American public. Hunter Biden had been convicted of three felony firearm offences during Special Counsel David Weiss' investigation, alongside federal tax charges for failing to pay over $1.4 million. Prior to his trial, Hunter entered an unexpected guilty plea.On January 19, 2025, just before leaving office, Biden granted clemency to his siblings James, Valerie, and Francis, along with their spouses. The pardons covered potential non-violent offences from January 1, 2014, through to the signing date. The House investigation revealed that Biden family members and associates had received over $27 million from foreign sources since 2014. Additionally, the family allegedly obtained more than $8 million in loans from Democratic supporters during Biden's vice presidency.On January 19, 2025, Biden also pardoned former General Mark Milley, Dr Anthony Fauci, and members of the January 6 House Select Committee. These pardons extended to committee staff and police officers who provided testimony. All pardons appeared to be signed using an autopen.","'Autopen is biggest political scandal in American history': Trump.

What JPMorgan’s letter says to new recruits

Jamie Dimon’s past warnings

Led by CEO Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan has issued a very stern warning to ‘unethical’ junior bankers who start looking at alternate job offers within 18 months of joining. A new letter, leaked on Litquidity's Instagram platform, warns the new recruits against job hopping.According to the letter, junior bankers securing alternative employment opportunities during their initial 18-month tenure risk immediate termination from JPMorgan amidst increasing competition for skilled professionals in Wall Street.The confidential correspondence to newly recruited JPMorgan analysts explicitly states that securing employment elsewhere would result in immediate dismissal from the bank, according to a New York Post report.""If you accept a position with another company before joining us or within your first 18 months, you will be provided notice and your employment with the firm will end,"" states the correspondence dated June 4, bearing signatures of JPMorgan's global banking co-heads Filippo Gori and John Simmons, the report said.The communication from both senior leaders emphasised that complete dedication and engagement are vital for achieving success in the investment banking analyst programme.Also Read | Donald Trump vs Elon Musk: Who has more to lose - US President or world’s richest man?

The executives further stated that ""missing any part of the training programme"" might result in dismissal, whilst highlighting that ""avoiding potential conflicts of interest is crucial to maintaining the trust and confidence our clients place in us.""The leadership also announced a reduction in the timeline to attain associate position by six months, making it 2.5 years, aiming to retain exceptional talent.Whilst their correspondence did not explicitly reference private equity organisations, these firms have historically employed strategies to recruit junior banking professionals following their initial training period, the report said.Jamie Dimon, the 69-year-old chief executive of JPMorgan, has consistently voiced concerns about private equity firms attracting fresh finance graduates with substantial salary packages that major US banks struggle to match.""I know a lot of you work at JPMorgan, you take a job at a private equity shop before you even start with us,"" Dimon had told a crowd of undergraduate business school students, terming it ""unethical.""During his address at Georgetown University's Psaros Center for Financial Markets and Policy in September, he expressed his disapproval, saying, ""It puts us in a bad position, and it puts us in a conflicted position.

Trump-Musk rift rattles Wall Street; Tesla share slide exposes market fragility; major indexes take a hit,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/trump-musk-rift-rattles-wall-street-tesla-share-slide-exposes-market-fragility-major-indexes-take-a-hit/articleshow/121705575.cms,"The public feud between US President Donald Trump and Tesla CEO Elon Musk has turned into both a political and a Wall Street drama, raising investor concerns and exposing the vulnerability of stock markets to sharp moves in major companies.The clash, which played out mostly on social media, triggered a 14% drop in Tesla shares on Thursday, after Trump threatened to cut off government contracts to Musk’s companies.Thursday's decline reduced Tesla's market value by approximately $150 billion, with its weight in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 at 1.6% and 2.6%, respectively.Tesla shares recovered partially on Friday, increasing about 5% by mid-day, reaching a market value of around $970 billion. Microsoft and Nvidia, both valued above $3 trillion, maintained weights of 6.9% and 6.8% in the S&P 500 as of Thursday.Despite a slight recovery on Friday, Thursday's sharp fall weighed heavily on major US indexes, with Tesla alone accounting for nearly half the day’s declines.The company's decline made up nearly half of the day's losses for both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100, which fell 0.5% and 0.8% respectively.The S&P 500 is widely seen as the key benchmark for the US stock market, while the tech-focused Nasdaq 100 underpins the popular Invesco QQQ ETF.""It's a widely held stock,"" said Robert Pavlik, senior portfolio manager at Dakota Wealth told Reuters.""When this big-name company that represents a sizable portion of the index sells off, it has an overall effect on the index, but it also has a psychological effect on investors,"" Pavlk added.The situation highlights long-standing concerns about index concentration in a small number of large-capitalisation stocks.The ""Magnificent Seven"", including Apple, Microsoft and Nvidia, collectively represented nearly one-third of the S&P 500's total weight as of Thursday's close.Though Tesla is the smallest among these tech and growth giants, it played a major role in driving index gains in 2023 and 2024.While 2025 started off uncertain, recent trends suggest signs of recovery.Tesla shares have dropped around 37% since mid-December, while the S&P 500 has fallen just 1% in the same period—reducing Tesla’s overall influence on the index.Tesla is included in about 10% of the roughly 4,200 ETFs, giving it wide market exposure, according to Todd Sohn, ETF and technical strategist at Strategas. Some major funds affected include the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund, which fell 2.5% on Thursday, and the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF, which declined 2.6%.""It's very important to know holistically what is in all your ETFs, because a lot of them are overlapping,"" the analyst noted.","Tesla shares fell 14% on Thursday after Donald Trump threatened to cut off government contracts to Elon Musk's companies.

His outburst came as Wall Street rallied on stronger-than-expected jobs data, with investors weighing the Fed’s next move amid rising political pressure and persistent economic uncertainty.“Too Late” at the Fed is a disaster! Europe has had 10 rate cuts, we have had none,” Trump wrote, insisting the Fed should “go for a full point, Rocket Fuel!” and sharply criticizing the Biden administration’s reliance on short-term borrowing. “There is virtually no inflation (anymore), but if it should come back, RAISE ‘RATE’ TO COUNTER. Very Simple!!! He is costing our Country a fortune.”Meanwhile, the S&P 500 index jumped 1.2% in morning trading, heading for its second straight weekly gain. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 555 points, or 1.3%, to 42,874.34, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite rose 1.3%, lifted by a rebound in major technology names.The rally was broad-based, with all 11 sectors of the S&P 500 in positive territory.Investors appeared to shrug off concerns about economic headwinds, drawing optimism from Friday’s Labour Department data that showed employers added 139,000 jobs in May. While slower than April’s revised figure of 147,000, the pace of hiring suggested continued labour market resilience despite Trump’s trade policies and regulatory crackdowns.Trump’s volatile tariff regime and threats against trading partners have drawn sharp criticism from US businesses. Retailer Lululemon plunged nearly 20% after cutting its annual profit guidance, blaming rising costs linked to Trump’s import taxes. The fallout added to warnings from other sectors, including airlines and consumer goods firms, about margin pressure and potential demand slowdown.Still, Friday’s bounce in equities was helped by hopes that the Trump administration could ease tensions with key partners. A reported “very good” phone call between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping raised optimism for progress in trade negotiations, although Chinese state media adopted a more cautious tone.Bond yields rose, reflecting shifting expectations for interest rate policy. The yield on the 10-year Treasury increased to 4.47% from 4.39% a day earlier, while the 2-year yield rose to 4.00%, up from 3.92%, indicating growing investor bets that the Fed could eventually pivot toward easing.Tesla shares recovered 3.6% following Thursday’s dramatic 14.5% plunge, triggered by Trump’s escalating feud with Elon Musk. The president had threatened to use executive powers to cut off federal contracts to Musk’s companies, wiping out nearly $150 billion in Tesla’s market value within a single session. The rebound came as both sides reportedly agreed to “cool off” amid backchannel talks arranged by White House aides.In global markets, European indexes posted modest gains while Asian equities were mixed. India’s Sensex rose 0.8% after the Reserve Bank of India cut its benchmark interest rate to 5.50%, marking a dovish shift as inflation eases.Oil prices remained stable, with US crude at $63.30 per barrel and Brent crude at $65.31. The dollar strengthened slightly against the yen, while the euro slipped to $1.1414, reflecting lingering caution in currency markets.As the Fed heads into its policy meeting later this month, markets remain on edge. Trump’s aggressive push for a large rate cut and his public criticism of Fed Chair Jerome Powell have reignited debate about central bank independence — and whether political pressure will influence the future trajectory of US interest rates.","The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 555 points, or 1.3%, to 42,874.34.

"Tariff tremors: US adds 139,000 jobs in May even as hiring slows and recession fears grow",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/tariff-tremors-us-adds-139000-jobs-in-may-even-as-hiring-slows-and-recession-fears-grow/articleshow/121676976.cms,"Amid rising concern over the economic fallout of President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs and federal workforce cuts, US employers added 139,000 jobs in May — a slowdown from the previous month, but still a sign of resilience in a jittery economy.Hiring eased from a revised 147,000 in April, while the unemployment rate held steady at 4.2%, the Labor Department said Friday. The monthly figure undershot expectations and added to the uncertainty surrounding Trump’s evolving trade stance and aggressive policy shifts, AP reported.Trump’s “massive taxes on imports — tariffs — are expected to raise costs for US companies that buy raw materials, equipment and components from overseas and force them to cut back hiring or even lay off workers,” the original AP report noted. At the same time, Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has initiated sharp staff cuts and cancelled federal contracts, further clouding the hiring outlook.Still, much of the economic damage hasn’t yet fully emerged in government data. “Any signs of weakness in the data this week would stoke fears of a recession again,” said former Federal Reserve economist Claudia Sahm, now chief economist at New Century Advisors.“It’s too soon to see the full effects of tariffs, DOGE, or other policies on the labor market; softening now would suggest less resilience to those later effects, raising the odds of a recession. ”Employers have added an average of 144,000 jobs per month so far this year — well below the pace of 168,000 in 2024, 216,000 in 2023, and 380,000 in 2022. In 2021, as the economy rebounded from the COVID-19 shock, monthly job creation had peaked at 603,000.The broader data picture remains mixed. Job openings rose unexpectedly to 7.4 million in April, but layoffs ticked up and fewer workers quit their jobs — a sign of reduced confidence in the labour market. Meanwhile, the number of new unemployment claims hit an eight-month high last week, even as overall levels remain historically low.Trump’s tariff moves — and the erratic way he rolls them out, suspends them and reintroduces new ones — have already left a mark. The nation’s GDP shrank at a 0.2% annual rate in the first quarter. Imports surged as firms rushed to bring in goods ahead of duties, then plunged 16% in April once tariffs took effect. That sharp decline, said Roosevelt Institute economist Michael Madowitz, could depress jobs in warehousing and logistics.Despite the headwinds, the US economy and labour market have, until now, defied expectations. “Whether it’s the ISM surveys, the ADP figures, or the jobless claims, the tone is clearly one of a weakening economic momentum,” noted Barclays Private Bank strategist Julien Lafargue.","Hiring eased from a revised 147,000 in April, while the unemployment rate held steady at 4.2%.

The S&P 500 also advanced, climbing 58 points to 5,997.59, up 0.98%, putting the benchmark index on the cusp of the key 6,000 level.At 9:40 am, Tesla Inc’s stock price rose sharply to $299.46, gaining $14.76 or 5.19% compared to the previous close.Markets were buoyed by improving investor sentiment, even as the US 10-year Treasury yield rose to 4.472%, up 7.7 basis points, reflecting shifting expectations on inflation and interest rates. Despite the uptick in yields, equities remained resilient.Earlier, Futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.3%, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq futures gained 0.4% each, signalling a cautious optimism ahead of fresh labor market data from the US Labour Department later in the day.Job growth slowed in May, with employers adding a solid but reduced 139,000 jobs, down from a revised 147,000 in April. The unemployment rate remained steady at 4.2%, underscoring a resilient labour market despite headwinds. Economists caution that Trump’s sweeping tariffs on imports, aimed at reducing trade deficits but raising costs for US companies, could eventually slow hiring and potentially tip the economy toward recession.Trump’s unpredictable trade war and his crackdown on illegal immigration — which may limit the available workforce — have clouded the economic outlook. However, the effects of these policies have yet to fully register in the government’s economic data.Adding to market jitters this week was a public spat between Trump and Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla and SpaceX. Tesla shares rebounded early Friday, climbing 4.7% after plunging 14.5% on Thursday following the heated exchange, which saw Trump threaten to use federal powers against Musk’s companies. The confrontation erased roughly $150 billion of Tesla’s market value in a single day, a loss larger than the market caps of many major US companies.Retail sector woes also surfaced as Lululemon shares plunged over 20% after the athletic apparel maker cut profit forecasts, citing tariff-related cost pressures and growing competition from start-ups. Consumer confidence appears to be wavering amid the ongoing tariff turmoil, weighing on discretionary spending.Investor hopes for a trade détente received a boost after Trump reported a “very good phone call” with China’s President Xi Jinping, with plans for their teams to meet soon. However, Chinese state media offered a more cautious assessment, tempering optimism.Global markets showed mixed reactions: Europe’s DAX and CAC 40 slipped modestly, while Asian indexes mostly advanced. India’s Sensex gained 0.8% following a key interest rate cut by the Reserve Bank of India to 5.50%.In the bond market, the yield on the US 10-year Treasury held steady near 4.39%, after falling earlier this week on speculation that the Federal Reserve may need to ease rates later this year to cushion the economic impact of tariffs.Energy prices showed little change, with US crude oil down slightly to $63.30 per barrel and Brent crude near $65.31.Currency markets reflected some risk-off sentiment: the US dollar strengthened against the yen, while the euro slipped to $1.1414.","The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) jumped 431 points to 42,750.83, a gain of 1.02%.

US holds off on labeling China a currency manipulator; warns Beijing on currency practices; keeps future action open,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-holds-off-on-labeling-china-a-currency-manipulator-warns-beijing-on-currency-practices-keeps-future-action-open/articleshow/121671663.cms,"US- China flags

The US treasury department on Thursday stopped short of labeling China a currency manipulator, but criticised Beijing for its lack of transparency in exchange rate policies. The decision came in the treasury’s semi-annual report to Congress on the foreign exchange and macroeconomic practices of major trading partners.While the report did not officially accuse China of manipulating its currency, it noted that China stood out for not being open about how it manages the renminbi (RMB). A Treasury official told reporters that the US may still make a determination in the fall, depending on new evidence that could emerge.During Donald Trump ’s first term, then-treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin had labeled China a currency manipulator in 2019, the first time the US had done so since 1994.US treasury secretary Scott Bessent said the administration “has put our trading partners on notice that macroeconomic policies that incentivize an unbalanced trading relationship with the United States will no longer be accepted.”He added that the treasury would use all available tools to counter unfair currency practices.The report comes as the Trump administration seeks to ease tensions with China and avoid a full-blown trade war. Trump said his first phone call with Chinese President Xi Jinping since returning to office was “very positive.”He announced that trade negotiations would resume soon, though a meeting location is yet to be determined.Following the call, Trump agreed to temporarily reduce tariffs on Chinese goods from 145- 30% per cent for 90 days to make room for talks. In response, China lowered its tariffs on US goods from 125- 10 per cent.The tariff adjustments have caused major swings in global markets and raised concerns about ongoing disruption to international trade, especially in critical sectors like rare earth minerals.","The US treasury department stopped short of labeling China a currency manipulator, but criticised Beijing for its lack of transparency in exchange rate policies. The decision came in the treasury’s semi-annual report to Congress on the foreign exchange and macroeconomic practices of major trading partners.

Trump vs Musk: How Donald Trump can cripple SpaceX and Tesla—if he chooses to pull the plug,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/trump-vs-musk-how-donald-trump-can-cripple-spacex-and-teslaif-he-chooses-to-pull-the-plug/articleshow/121675254.cms,"Built on billions: The scale of public support

Trump’s leverage: Political feud meets financial power

Regulatory chokehold: How else Trump could strike

‘We earned that’: Musk’s companies respond

Can Musk survive without Washington?

As political tensions flare, experts warn that Elon Musk’s empire, built on public funding, could face steep fallout. At the intersection of ambition and politics, Elon Musk’s multibillion-dollar space and electric vehicle empire may soon be at the mercy of President Donald Trump Despite being a vocal critic of government subsidies, Musk’s companies—SpaceX and Tesla—have long depended on them. And now, Trump’s public feud with the billionaire threatens to upend a financial relationship that has fuelled some of the most significant technological advances in America’s recent history.An in-depth investigation by The Washington Post revealed that Musk’s ventures have received at least $38 billion in government contracts, subsidies, loans and tax credits, much of it in just the past five years. That includes at least $6.3 billion pledged in 2024 alone. Tesla and SpaceX—two of the world’s most prominent tech companies—have not only thrived on this backing but, in many cases, owe their very survival to it.With Trump threatening to slash federal support over their growing differences, the question now being asked in Washington and Wall Street alike is: Could he actually destroy Musk’s business empire?Tesla’s journey from a cash-strapped start-up to the world’s leading EV manufacturer has been paved with government help.According to The Post, a $465 million low-interest loan from the Department of Energy in 2010 allowed Tesla to engineer its flagship Model S and purchase a major California factory. The company repaid the loan by 2013, but not before it became central to Tesla’s survival and eventual IPO.In total, Tesla has earned $11.4 billion in regulatory credits from federal and state programs incentivising zero-emission vehicles—enough to offset years of operating losses. As The New York Times notes, those credits were instrumental in turning Tesla’s first annual profit in 2020. Without them, the company would have reported a loss of $718 million.Meanwhile, SpaceX has grown into the most vital contractor in America’s space program. NASA alone has invested nearly $15 billion in the company, which now operates the only crew and cargo transport to the International Space Station. The Pentagon and US intelligence agencies have also poured billions into SpaceX launches and secure satellite deployments.Under a $5 billion contract, SpaceX’s Dragon capsule remains the only American vehicle capable of crewed missions to the ISS. Musk’s threat—and Trump’s counter of potential contract terminations—now raises alarms about how political retaliation could upend US space programs.NASA press secretary Bethany Stevens told Reuters, “We will continue to work with our industry partners to ensure the president’s objectives in space are met.”As the relationship between Musk and Trump deteriorates, so do the prospects for continued public support. Trump has already proposed slashing key tax credits and subsidies, including the $7,500 consumer EV credit. According to analysts at JPMorgan, this could cost Tesla $1.2 billion in annual profit.Worse still, The New York Times reports that Trump has publicly threatened to cancel federal contracts to Musk’s companies. While that might seem unlikely given SpaceX’s dominant position, experts warn it’s not out of the question.As Ars Technica reports, such a move could set back the US space program by a decade. SpaceX is currently the only provider of crewed space flights for NASA and is contracted to safely de-orbit the International Space Station in 2030. It is also critical to America’s Moon mission via NASA’s Artemis program.While SpaceX’s market dominance may buffer it from complete collapse, analysts say the damage would still be immense.“It fortunately wouldn’t be catastrophic... but there’s no question that it would result in significant lost revenue and missed contract opportunities,” said Justus Parmar, CEO of SpaceX investor Fortuna Investments, reported Reuters.Former NASA deputy administrator Lori Garver said pulling contracts would likely be illegal. But she warned Musk’s actions were dangerous: “A rogue CEO threatening to decommission spacecraft, putting astronauts’ lives at risk, is untenable.”Even without tearing up contracts, Trump could take a more insidious route: the regulatory bottleneck. As Ars Technica notes, agencies like the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) could slow or stall key Musk projects.The FAA could restrict Starship launch expansions, while NHTSA could ramp up scrutiny of Tesla’s Full Self Driving and Autopilot features—putting product development at risk.These tools are under Trump’s executive branch influence and could be weaponised without needing Congressional approval. “If the Trump government does in its feud with Musk is attack his financial interests,” said Paul Levinson, a professor at Fordham University, “Musk is very likely to not only survive but continue to thrive. But regulatory delays could reshape timelines and margins.”Despite the heavy reliance on public funding, Musk and his executives have defended their role in serving government interests. “We earned that,” SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell said recently of federal contracts, pointing to the company’s track record in cutting costs and delivering results.Indeed, many in Washington see Musk’s ventures as having advanced key US goals—from decarbonising transport to dominating low-Earth orbit. “NASA is working with partners like SpaceX… for the benefit of all,” said NASA spokeswoman Cheryl Warner.Still, the contrast between Musk’s anti-subsidy rhetoric and the billions his companies receive hasn’t gone unnoticed. Yale professor Jeffrey Sonnenfeld told The Post, “With DOGE [Department of Government Efficiency], there does seem to be a paradox there. He has been a big beneficiary of national industrial policy.”In the short term, the answer is: possibly. Tesla has repaid loans and now generates billions in profit. SpaceX’s commercial Starlink service is booming. But long-term survival without government support is far less certain—particularly in the face of regulatory headwinds or a cancelled lunar contract.“Elon Musk is undeniably the architect of his empire,” said George Washington University’s John Helveston to NPR. “But government scaffolding helped build the skyscraper. If Trump starts pulling pieces out, the whole thing doesn’t collapse—but it shakes.”For now, Musk appears publicly defiant. But behind closed doors in Washington and Silicon Valley, the calculations are more cautious. The fate of America’s most iconic tech visionary may yet hinge on politics more than engineering.","Elon Musk’s multibillion-dollar space and electric vehicle empire may soon be at the mercy of President Donald Trump.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume.

It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran Udaan until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.Udaan built an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business still accounts for a very small part of India’s overall retail market but can balloon to $150 billion in sales and yield a 100% return on capital invested in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co. estimates published in the Mint newspaper.Bengaluru-based Udaan has also ventured into financing through its fintech unit which helps shopkeepers get working capital loans to buy inventory. That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says. Udaan competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods. The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-105001128,imgsize-151312,width-400,resizemode-4/105001128.jpg"

How India's GDP has been growing

What SBI report said on savings and investment

Incremental capital output ratio

NEW DELHI: India's gross domestic product (GDP) data for the third quarter (October-December 2022) received a word of caution from the former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan In an interview with news agency PTI, Rajan that India is ""dangerously close"" to the Hindu rate of growth in view of subdued private sector investment, high interest rates and slowing global growth.India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying"".However, a report released by the State Bank of India (SBI) economists on Tuesday dismissed arguments that India is dangerously close to Hindu rate of growth saying such statements are ""ill-conceived, biased and premature"".The term 'Hindu growth rate' was coined by late economist Raj Krishna in 1978 to describe the slow growth in the country.It basically refers to the low pace of economic growth rates during 1950s to 1980s. During this period, the Indian economy averaged 3.5%.A former lecturer at the Delhi School of Economics (DSE), Krishna noted that only if the rate of growth is persistently slow and accompanied by low per-capita GDP, then it will be known as Hindu rate of growth but it has to factor in population growth as well.Before economic reforms of 1991, India's economic growth remained stagnant and low, while per capita income averaged around 1.3%. Krishna termed this low growth situation to be a result of socialist policies of state control and import substitution.However, the economic situation changed when liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation (LPG) reforms came into effect in the year 1991, at a time when India faced balance of payment crisis.Over the years, many economists have strongly opposed the idea of 'Hindu growth rate' and the term never had universal acceptance.The Indian economy plunged into its very first technical recession in FY21 due to the impact of Covid-19 pandemic and the related nationwide lockdowns. GDP shrunk by an unprecedented 23.8% in the first quarter of the financial year 2020-21. However, due to spurt in economic activities in the subsequent quarters, the GDP decline started to narrow.However, if we look at the period before Covid-19 as well, India's growth curve shows a declining trend.From 8.26% in FY17, GDP growth plunged to 3.74% in FY20. Shutdown of economic activities in FY21 in wake of Covid-19 only made matters worse.As lockdowns started to ease and business activities resumed, India's GDP also started rising. In Q1 of FY22, growth jumped to 20.1% mainly on account of low base effect. By the fourth quarter of FY22, growth came down to 4.10%.Similarly, the new financial year 2022-23 brought fresh economic challenges in the form of Russia-Ukraine war that impacted almost all major economies of the world, slowed the pace of growth, pushed inflation to record highs.As a result, the central banks of all advanced economies spurred into action and opted for monetary policy tightening to curb the soaring inflation.With persistently rising interest rates, India's economy grew by 4.4% in Q3 of FY23, as the Centre revised upwards GDP growth for previous year to 9.10% from 8.7% earlier.The report weighed recent GDP numbers against the available data on savings and investments for the past decade and highlighted some interesting points.""Quarterly growth numbers are noisy and should be best avoided for any serious interpretation (on an average, India's GDP growth has witnessed Rs 2 lakh crore upward revision for the 3 year ended FY23),"" the report said.Gross capital formation (GCF) by the government touched a high of 11.8% in 2021-22, up from 10.7% in 2020-21.""This also had a domino effect on private sector investment that jumped from 10 per cent to 10.8% over the same period,"" it said.In fact, Ecowrap added that the trends in GCF to gross output ratio or the plough back of funds for creation of fresh capacity shows that for public administration the ratio attained fresh peak in 2021-22 owing to the emphasis on capital expenditure in recent budgets.At the aggregate level, gross capital formation is supposed to have crossed 32% in 2022-23, the highest level since 2018-19.According to the report, in 2021-22, gross savings have risen to 30% from 29% in 2020-21.""The ratio is supposed to have crossed 31 per cent in 2022-23, the highest since 2018-19. The household savings increased sharply during the pandemic period on account of sharp accretion in financial savings such as deposits,"" said the report by SBI's Economic Research Department.While household financial savings have since then moderated from 15.4% in 2020-21 to 11.1% in 2022-23, savings in physical assets have grown sharply to 11.8% in 2021-22 from 10.7% in 2020-21.The report further analysed Incremental Capital Output ratio (ICOR) -- which measures additional units of capital (investment) needed to produce additional units of output. It said that the ratio has been improving.""ICOR which was 7.5 in FY 12 is now only 3.5 in FY22. Clearly, only half of capital is now needed for next unit of output,"" the report noted.Such reducing ICOR in the current years reflects a relatively increasing efficiency of capital and shows that the economy is on a sound footing, the report said.""From that point of view, future GDP growth rates even at 7% could still mean a decent number by any standards!,"" it added.","India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.

An employee is entitled for a 50 per cent amount of the last drawn salary as pension.OPS was discontinued by the NDA government in 2003 with effect from April 1, 2004.Under the new pension scheme (NPS), employees contribute 10 per cent of their basic salary towards pension while the government contributes 14 per cent.Governments of Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand have informed the central government/ Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA about their decision to restart OPS for their employees.The government of Punjab on November 18, 2022, issued a notification regarding implementation of OPS for the state government employees who are being covered under NPS. Jharkhand too has decided to revert to OPS.",Former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan has expressed his concern over the decision of some states to restart the old pension scheme.

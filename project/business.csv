TOI Correspondent from Washington:

In a sweeping reset during Xbox’s 25th anniversary year, Satya Nadella-led Microsoft has named Asha Sharma as CEO of Microsoft Gaming, pitching another Indian-American into a leadership position at a time of intense xenophobia in MAGA circles. Wisconsin-born Sharma, 43, succeeds Phil Spencer, the widely admired Xbox chief who is retiring after nearly four decades at the company.Sharma, who has wheeled though Instacart and Meta among other companies as a senior executive, most recently served as President of CoreAI at Microsoft, where she led efforts to embed advanced models into the company’s cloud and developer stack. Before returning to Microsoft, where she had an earlier stint, Sharma was Chief Operating Officer at Instacart, helping steer the delivery platform through its IPO and a volatile post-pandemic reset. Earlier, at Meta, she oversaw product and engineering for Facebook Messenger and Instagram Direct, guiding communications products used by billions.A graduate of the Carlson School of Management at the University of Minnesota, Sharma’s resume reads like a map of the modern tech economy: marketplaces, social platforms, cloud, and AI. Microsoft Chairman and CEO Satya Nadella praised her “deep experience building and growing platforms,” signaling that the company sees operational discipline and AI integration as critical to Xbox’s next chapter.The appointment immediately ignited debate across gaming forums and social media, with critics arguing she lacks direct experience in game development at a moment when Microsoft Gaming faces declining revenues and the complex integration of the $69 billion Activision Blizzard acquisition. Fans accustomed to Spencer’s gamer-first persona questioned whether an “AI specialist” might privilege algorithms over artistry.Sharma moved quickly to address the concerns in her first memo to staff and in an interview with Variety, acknowledging she has “a lot to learn” about the creative side of the business and vowed to “earn the right to be trusted.” She promised a “return of Xbox,” insisting the company would not chase short-term efficiencies or flood the ecosystem with what she called “soulless AI slop.” Games, she wrote, “are and always will be art, crafted by humans. ”Sharma’s elevation places her among a cadre of Indian-American leaders running major US tech companies, including Nadella at Microsoft and Sundar Pichai at Alphabet/Google, whose subsidiary YouTube is also helmed by Indian-American Neal Mohan. For many, it is another milestone in the continued ascent of Indian-origin executives in Silicon Valley who remain uninhibited in the face of MAGA paranoia.Still, the appointment has unfolded in a fraught political moment. Online, some MAGA-aligned voices have recycled claims of corporate nepotism and “favoring their own,” casting Sharma as part of an “Indian tech-bro” archetype. The backlash comes at a time of heightened scrutiny over H-1B visas and the ""America First"" movement, even as Sharma’s background remains firmly rooted in the American Midwest; she was born and raised in Racine, Wisconsin, and built her career through mainstream US institutions and companies.Industry observers say the backlash reflects broader anxieties—about globalization, immigration, and the dominance of tech—rather than Sharma’s credentials. “In this era, a gaming CEO needs to protect creatives while navigating AI and scale,” one analyst wrote on Reddit. “You don’t need to be a hardcore gamer; you need to be a platform architect.”Microsoft Gaming is valued at roughly $80 billion and spans consoles, PC, cloud gaming, and a portfolio of studios that now includes Activision Blizzard. The mandate before Sharma is formidable: stabilize revenue, extract value from blockbuster acquisitions, and define how AI augments—rather than supplants—creative work.","Asha Sharma, 43, succeeds Phil Spencer, the widely admired Xbox chief who is retiring after nearly four decades at the company.

'Extraordinarily anti-American decision': Donald Trump unleashes fury at US Supreme Court after hiking global tariffs from 10% to 15%,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/countries-ripping-the-us-off-trump-hikes-worldwide-tariff-to-15-after-supreme-court-setback/articleshow/128650288.cms,"US President Donald Trump (File photo)

Explained: How US tariffs on India evolved amid Supreme Court ruling and trade disputes

Supreme Court's ruling on Trump tariffs



US President Donald Trump on Saturday increased the global tariff he had announced a day earlier from 10% to 15%, in a strong reaction to the US Supreme Court’s landmark ruling that dealt a stinging blow to his second tenure as president.In a post on Truth Social, the MAGA supremo blasted the Supreme Court’s ruling as “ridiculous and poorly written” and declared it “extraordinarily anti-American.” A furious Trump wrote, “Based on a thorough, detailed, and complete review of the ridiculous, poorly written, and extraordinarily anti-American decision on tariffs issued yesterday, after MANY months of contemplation, by the United States Supreme Court, please let this statement serve to represent that I, as President of the United States of America, will be, effective immediately, raising the 10% Worldwide Tariff on Countries, many of which have been ‘ripping’ the US off for decades, without retribution (until I came along!), to the fully allowed, and legally tested, 15% level. ”“During the next short number of months, the Trump Administration will determine and issue the new and legally permissible tariffs, which will continue our extraordinarily successful process of Making America Great Again — GREATER THAN EVER BEFORE!!!,” he added further.The move came after the US Supreme Court declared Trump’s tariff actions illegal and questioned his authority to impose sweeping import duties without congressional approval.Immediately after the ruling, Trump expressed his “deep disappointment” in an agitated tone and said he was “ashamed” of the Supreme Court. He alleged that the judgment had been influenced by “foreign interests.”Taking a jibe at the bench that delivered the 6–3 ruling, Trump said, “They’re so happy. And they’re dancing in the streets, but they won’t be dancing for long. That I can assure you. The Democrats on the court are thrilled, but they will automatically vote no. They’re an automatic no, just like in Congress. They’re an automatic no. They’re against anything that makes America strong, healthy, and great again.”The enraged US president also declared, “I can do anything I want.” Moving ahead using tariff as weapon, Trump invoked Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974 to impose a fresh 10 per cent global tariff on imports, which he revised on Saturday to 15 per cent.In a strong rebuttal to Trump, chief justice John Roberts, writing for the majority, said the President does not have the authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) of 1977 to impose tariffs. The court stated that “had Congress intended to convey the distinct and extraordinary power to impose tariffs, it would have done so expressly.”The ruling supports earlier decisions by the US Court of International Trade and a federal appeals court. Both courts had found that IEEPA, a law usually used to freeze assets or block financial transactions during national emergencies, does not automatically give the President the power to impose tariffs.Three conservative justices, Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, and Brett Kavanaugh, disagreed with the majority opinion. In their dissent, they argued that the law’s broad language allowing the President to “regulate” economic transactions during a declared emergency should be understood to include the power to impose tariffs.","US President Donald Trump on Saturday increased the global tariff he had announced a day earlier from 10% to 15%.

Gold, Silver Under Pressure After Peaks: Should You Invest And Hold Precious Metals Or Sell Off?

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market, other asset classes or personal finance management tips given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)

Gold and silver have delivered eye-popping returns over the last one year. In contrast, Sensex and Nifty have delivered a muted performance. Gold and silver have already delivered an exceptional run over the past year, with silver posting gains of around 160% and gold posting over 80% gains domestically in 2025. Over the past one year, precious metals have clearly outpaced equities.Gold in India is hovering around Rs 1.55–1.60 lakh per 10 grams and silver is near Rs 2.60–2.70 lakh per kg after a sharp rally driven by geopolitical tensions, strong central bank buying, inflation concerns and currency weakness. In comparison, the Nifty 50 and Sensex have delivered relatively moderate single-year returns, reflecting a more measured earnings environment.This has prompted investors to wonder if their portfolios should be oriented more towards gold and silver, than equities. But gold and silver have also seen a brutal selloff in the recent weeks, dropping from their record highs, though the precious metals are still sitting on decent returns. Before you make the decision on which asset class to invest in, experts believe it’s prudent to look at historical data to understand how returns in gold, silver and equities shape up over longer time periods.A commonly asked question in the minds of investors is: where should the hard earned money be put to earn the best returns? Over a 1-year, 5-year and 10-year time period, which asset class has offered the highest returns - gold, silver or equities?Looking at performance across time periods gives useful perspective, and a deeper understanding into investments should ideally be allocated.According to Somil Mehta, Head of Retail Research at Mirae Asset Sharekhan, equity markets tend to be volatile. Stocks can outperform sharply in good years, but also see corrections. Gold and silver usually provide stability, especially during global uncertainty, he tells TOI.Over a 5-year time frame, equities (Nifty and Sensex) generally outperform precious metals, supported by earnings growth and economic expansion. Gold performs well during risk-off phases, while silver remains more volatile, Mehta says.However, according to Mehta, over a decade, equities clearly emerge as the strongest wealth creators. Gold delivers steady returns, acting more as a hedge than a growth asset. Silver’s performance is uneven due to its industrial demand cycle.Experts note that the last one year has been an outlier for precious metals as they significantly outperformed equities, with silver and gold delivering strong gains amid safe-haven demand due to global trade concerns (US tariffs) and geopolitical uncertainty, while Nifty returns remained relatively muted.An analysis by TOI on gold, silver and stock markets over various time-frames notes that annual averages smooth out the ups and downs within the year — closer to how most people actually experience prices.On a 3-year horizon check the TOI analysis notes: “A top stock outpaces metals by a wide margin, and category-leading mid/small-cap funds compete strongly. The takeaway: one ‘best asset’ rarely stays best across cycles.”For a 5-year period the winners look different: strong equity funds (mid/small-cap leaders near the high-20s CAGR) look better than metals, and the top-performing NSE-100 stock is in a different league. Message: metals can be easy; equity wealth often comes from riding volatility, says the TOI analysis.Akshat Garg, Head of Research and Product at Choice Wealth notes that when the time frame is expanded, equities continue to demonstrate the power of compounding. “Businesses grow revenues, expand margins and reinvest profits, which creates sustainable wealth over long periods. Gold and silver, on the other hand, do not generate earnings; they primarily act as stores of value and crisis hedges. They outperform during uncertainty, but over full economic cycles equities tend to lead,” he tells TOI.According to Somil Mehta, Head of Retail Research at Mirae Asset Sharekhan, this year equities are likely to outperform precious metals, provided economic growth remains stable.“Gold may deliver moderate returns if global uncertainty, geopolitical risks, or currency volatility persist. Silver could underperform gold due to higher volatility and dependence on industrial demand,” he tells TOI.However, Maneesh Sharma, AVP - Commodities & Currencies, Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers still sees gold and silver outperforming equites.“As far as equity outlook is concerned, fundamental growth numbers remain crucial for the current year. This is evident from the fact that as the Nifty's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio hovers around 22.5 as of mid-February 2026, it trades near its 3-year average of 25.2x, but with the Sensex P/E exceeding its 15-year average, it leaves little room for multiple expansion without fundamental earnings acceleration. Hence cautious optimism persists for Nifty returns this year,” he tells TOI.“Gold & Silver are still expected to outperform equities amid persistent global uncertainties, including geopolitical tensions & structural imbalances in developed economies leading to growing deficits. Central bank demand remains a bullish pillar for gold prices, with many central banks indicating plans to increase their holdings this year although pace of increase is expected to moderate,” he says.While anticipating a good year for gold and silver, Sneha Poddar, VP-Research, Wealth Management, Motilal Oswal Financial Services sees equities giving a 10% return.“Broader commodities space, especially precious metals, could continue to stay resilient in 2026, though not in a one-way rally like last year; instead, may see phases of consolidation with the price levels subject to revision as per evolving macro and liquidity conditions,” she says.The expert anticipates that equities will return to the forefront with an expected 10% price return for Nifty over one year, considering improving earnings trajectory with PAT expected to grow at around 12% CAGR over FY25-27E.“We anticipate improved earnings growth, given the supportive domestic policies (both fiscal and monetary) and strengthening global trade opportunities following recent announcements of trade deals (US, EU) and foreign trade agreements,” she told TOI.Akshat Garg, Head of Research and Product at Choice Wealth sees volatility in the prices of gold and silver this year. “Metals may remain supported if global risks and liquidity trends persist, but after a strong rally volatility cannot be ruled out,” he says.“The bigger lesson for investors is that leadership rotates. Instead of chasing the recent outperformer, diversification and disciplined rebalancing work better,” he tells TOI.Taking a different view, Jateen Trivedi, VP Research Commodity, LKP Securities sees both gold and silver performing due to ongoing global uncertainties.“Given continued geopolitical tensions, trade uncertainties, currency volatility, and sustained central bank buying, bullion may remain structurally supported into 2026. At the same time, equity markets could face sectoral challenges, particularly from global AI disruption and earnings pressures,” Trivedi tells TOI.Broadly he sees gold in the Rs 1,75,000 – Rs 1,85,000 range; silver in the Rs 3,00,000 – 3,25,000 range and Nifty at around 27,000 (assuming no major geopolitical escalation).“Metals may continue to outperform if uncertainty persists, though volatility will remain high,” he says.The biggest lesson from the historical performance of gold, silver and equities is clear: don’t chase the recent winner, don’t bet blindly on last year’s outperformer!“This is perhaps the oldest mistake in investing, and also the most common. Investors who rushed into silver after its 2025 rally are taking on far more risk than they realise. Those who ignored gold for years before 2025 paid a price too. The data across decades tells us clearly: no single asset stays on top forever,” says InCred Money.Somil Mehta, Head of Retail Research, Mirae Asset SharekhanFor a 5-10 year time horizon, Somil recommends a portfolio that has 55-65% in equities (focus on quality large caps and structural sectors); 10-15% for gold and silver with gold as the main hedge; 20-30% in debt or fixed income for stability and liquidity.Somil Mehta says: “Equities remain the best long-term wealth creator, while gold plays a supporting role. A balanced portfolio, not chasing short-term winners, is the most reliable way to build wealth over time.”For Sneha Poddar of MOFSL the sure-shot way to win in the long-term is that investing ultimately hinges on discipline, diversification and a clear understanding of the asset class.“While metals often outperform during volatile macro phases, equities deliver steadier returns and should remain the core long-term allocation, with gold and silver serving as strategic hedges within a well-balanced portfolio,” she says.“For a balanced and relatively stable portfolio, gold should ideally carry a slightly higher weight than silver depending on investors risk profile and tenure of investment. Therefore, portfolios can ideally comprise 85-90% equities and 10–15% gold/silver. Over longer periods, equities historically deliver steady wealth creation, while metals act as portfolio stabilisers rather than return drivers,” she says.Akshat Garg of Choice Wealth is of the view that a portfolio with roughly 60–70% equities, 20–30% debt and 5–10% allocation to gold and silver offers a balanced blend of growth, stability and protection for a 5-10 year time period.The important thing to understand is that equities, metals, bonds — all carry cycles of outperformance and correction. “The key lesson is diversification. Chasing recent winners without balance increases portfolio risk. A balanced mix helps capture upside while managing long-term volatility,” says LKP Securities’ Jateen Trivedi.InCred Money notes that there is no one-size-fits-all allocation, but a simple rule of thumb is this: over a 5-year horizon, lean balanced, around 50–60% equities and 40–50% high-quality fixed income, so you participate in growth without exposing near-term goals (like a home down payment or business capital) to excessive volatility.Over a 10-year horizon, you can afford to tilt more toward growth, 60–75% equities and the rest in bonds or other stable assets, because time smooths out market cycles and compounds returns.The real driver is your risk appetite and goal clarity: if a 15–20% drawdown keeps you up at night, dial down equities; if your goals are long-term wealth creation and you can stay invested through volatility, lean into growth. Allocation should protect your sleep first, and then grow your wealth, says InCred Money.As InCred Money concludes: Gold is your safety net. When stock markets fall, gold tends to hold its ground or rise. It doesn't make you rich overnight, but it protects what you already have. Silver is more of a wild card, unfortunately, because of speculators. It can shoot up in good times, but it can fall just as hard. Stocks, over time, are the real wealth builders, but they demand patience.The investor who wins over the long run is rarely the one who picked the hottest asset of the year. It's the one who stayed diversified, stayed calm, and didn't let headlines drive their decisions.",Gold and silver have delivered eye-popping returns over the last one year. Sensex and Nifty have delivered a muted performance. Gold in India is hovering around Rs 1.55–1.60 lakh per 10 grams and silver is near Rs 2.60–2.70 lakh per kg.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128646524,imgsize-49908,width-400,resizemode-4/gold-silver-or-stocks.jpg"

NEW DELHI: The Adani Group and Embraer have deepened their resolve to set up a final assembly line (FAL) in India. Taking the next step from an initial pact last month, Adani Defence & Aerospace and Embraer Saturday exchanged an “enhanced” MoU for an E175 FAL, in the presence of Brazil president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and commerce minister Piyush Goyal. The MoU was exchanged between Adani Defence & Aerospace director Jeet Adani and Embraer president & CEO Francisco Gomes Neto. The 76-88 seater E175 regional jet is used for short to medium-haul flights and at present in India, eight of them are flying with Star Air and one is in Reliance Industries fleet.“This advancement from the initial MoU signed in January 2026 represents a significant step forward and forms part of a broader roadmap to develop an integrated regional transport aircraft (RTA) ecosystem in India…. for the E175. Both companies are already working together to progress all aspects of the MoU, including opportunities in aircraft manufacturing, supply chain, aftermarket services, and pilot training, and securing orders to support the proposed FAL,” Embraer said in a statement.Jeet Adani said: “Regional aviation is the backbone of economic expansion. With initiatives like UDAN transforming air connectivity across Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities, the need for an indigenous regional aviation ecosystem has become critical.This partnership will also strengthen strategic relations between India and Brazil, bringing complementary capabilities together.”Francisco Gomes Neto said: “The E175 has a global track record of enabling efficient, high-frequency regional operations and India is a key growth market in that segment. This signing represents a critical milestone for our partnership, as we continue to work together on all aspects of the proposed aerospace ecosystem, including securing orders for a FAL in India.”As one of the world’s fastest growing aviation markets in terms of passenger traffic, India is expected to require at least 500 aircraft in the 80-to-146 seat segment over the next 20 years. This reflects a strong demand for efficient regional and short-haul connectivity driven by smaller, efficient jets.Embraer has a growing footprint and long history in India, with nearly 50 Embraer aircraft and 11 aircraft types currently operating across commercial, defence and business aviation.",The Adani Group and Embraer have deepened their resolve to set up a final assembly line (FAL) in India.

CMDs of NTPC, NHPC, SECI, PFC, Grid-India and PGCIL are also expected to participate.Power secretaries from various state governments and heads of selected state-owned power generation, transmission and distribution utilities will join the discussions.“Taking into consideration the landscape of the sector with crucial projects, the role of central and state governments in planning and regulation as well as the recent developments in the functions of generation, transmission and distribution of power, the CAG's institution has planned to organise a one-day All India Conference of Power Secretaries,” the CAG office said.The institution said deliberations at the conference would help shape audit strategies for different segments of the power sector.According to the CAG, the event aims to provide a strategic platform for senior stakeholders to exchange views on sectoral challenges, with discussions expected to focus on digitalisation, renewable energy integration and the financial sustainability of distribution companies (DISCOMs).A background paper prepared jointly by the CAG’s office, the Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad and Vasudha Foundation highlighted the rapid transformation of India’s electricity ecosystem over the past decade.It noted that the sector has doubled generation capacity, achieved universal electrification, transitioned into a net exporter of electricity and moved towards near-zero outages.India also met its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) target of achieving 50 per cent non-fossil fuel capacity in 2025, five years ahead of schedule.As of December 2025, total installed power capacity stood at 514 GW, of which 267 GW — or 52 per cent — came from non-fossil sources, while solar power alone accounted for 136 GW, or 26 per cent of the capacity mix.The background paper said these developments underpin the Viksit Bharat vision, positioning the power sector as a central pillar for achieving a developed economy by 2047.The Draft National Electricity Policy 2026 (NEP 2026), released in January, outlines a long-term roadmap for generation expansion, pricing reforms, distribution improvements and grid management, while supporting India’s net-zero target for 2070.The policy proposes increasing per capita electricity consumption from the current 1,460 kWh to 2,000 kWh by 2030 and further to 4,000 kWh by 2047.“It is clear that clean energy is India's strategic advantage, but only if markets, finance and institutions evolve together,” the paper added.","The daylong National Conference on Power Sector, to be held in the capital, will bring together senior officials from the Centre and states.

NEW DELHI: Union minister Pralhad Joshi on Saturday said the Centre will study the recent US Supreme Court ruling on tariffs before making any official statement, stressing that the matter will be handled by the Piyush Goyal-led commerce ministry and Jaishankar's ministry of external affairs (MEA).Speaking to reporters here, Joshi said, ""I have read in the media that the US top court has given some judgment and the Indian government will study that, and whatever the reaction needs to be given, that will be given by the commerce ministry and MEA, not by me.""His remarks come after the US Supreme Court, in a 6–3 ruling, said the Trump administration had exceeded its authority by using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) of 1977 to impose sweeping import tariffs.Chief Justice John Roberts , along with Justices Neil Gorsuch, Amy Coney Barrett and the three liberal justices, ruled that IEEPA does not allow the president to impose tariffs, as that power is constitutionally given to Congress.However, US President Donald Trump called the verdict a ""terrible decision"" and announced a fresh 10 per cent global tariff under Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974, which permits temporary import surcharges for up to 150 days.He also said that he is ""ashamed"" of the Supreme Court, after it handed him the stinging defeat in the second stint of his presidency.Meanwhile, Joshi also criticised the Indian Youth Congress for staging a shirtless protest during the India AI Summit. ""It is the most shameful thing that the Congress party is behaving like this when 20 heads of state, 45 ministers and important functionaries from nearly 150 countries participated,"" he said.""Instead of celebrating India's performance, they are trying to create a ruckus. They are trying to become a hurdle for the growth of India,"" he added.The protest on Friday saw Youth Congress members removing their shirts at the summit venue, accusing Prime Minister Narendra Modi of being ""compromised."" Police later detained the protesters. In a statement, the Youth Congress said the demonstration was against a ""compromised Prime Minister who has traded the identity of the country at the AI Summit.""","Union minister Pralhad Joshi says the Centre will study the recent US Supreme Court ruling on tariffs before making any official statement.

Eighty-six countries and two international organisations have signed the AI Impact Summit declaration, signalling broad global support for shared principles on responsible and inclusive artificial intelligence, IT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said on Saturday.The declaration was adopted at the conclusion of the India AI Impact Summit held in New Delhi, with signatories including the US, UK, Canada, China, Denmark and Germany, the minister said.Speaking to reporters, Vaishnaw said participating nations have formalised principles centred on “welfare of all, and happiness of all”.“Prime Minister Narendra Modi's human-centric AI vision been accepted by the world. Democratising Artificial Intelligence resources so AI facilities, services and technology can reach everyone in society has been accepted by all,” he said, PTI quoted.The minister added that the framework emphasises balancing economic growth with broader societal goals.“Not just economic growth, even social harmony has to be kept in mind. Safety and trust are at the centre, they have been brought among the main points,” Vaishnaw said, adding that efforts are focused on building a secure, trustworthy and robust AI ecosystem.He noted that innovation and development of human capital were among the other key areas identified for cooperation.“For all these areas, all countries have agreed to work together. Almost all countries that participated, including the US, the UK, Canada, China, Denmark, Egypt, Indonesia, and Germany... everyone has participated,” the minister said.The AI Impact Summit secured investment commitments exceeding $250 billion in infrastructure, which Vaishnaw on Friday described as a “grand success”.Participation at the event crossed five lakh visitors, reflecting strong domestic and global engagement with India’s artificial intelligence initiatives, he had said earlier.The summit brought together global policymakers, industry leaders and technology experts, positioning India as an important player in discussions on international AI governance and infrastructure development.“More than five lakh visitors participated in the exhibition, learnt a lot, and interacted with many experts from around the world. We had practically every major AI player in the world participating in large numbers. We had so many startups getting the opportunity to showcase their work. Overall, the quality of the discussion was phenomenal,” Vaishnaw said.He added that participation across ministerial dialogues, leaders’ plenaries and the inaugural sessions reflected high-quality engagement throughout the summit.Investment pledges crossed $250 billion in infrastructure-related capital and about $20 billion in venture capital and deep-tech investments, underscoring global confidence in India’s role in the emerging AI ecosystem.The summit also saw participation from global technology leaders including Google CEO Sundar Pichai, OpenAI chief Sam Altman, Microsoft vice-chair Brad Smith and Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei, with discussions covering AI opportunities and risks, artificial general intelligence, governance frameworks and the future of jobs.","The declaration was adopted at the conclusion of the India AI Impact Summit held in New Delhi.

Regenerative Orthopaedics offers biologic, image-guided alternatives that aim to repair and regenerate rather than remove and replace.At the centre of this movement is Dr Venkatesh (Ven) Movva, Founder of RegenOrthoSport . A fellowship-trained Sports Medicine physician with board certification and over three decades of experience across Dallas, Mumbai, Bengaluru, and Hyderabad, Dr Movva has pioneered precision-based, non-surgical treatments using autologous bone marrow stem cells, high-concentration platelets, and growth factors to stimulate targeted tissue repair.Dr Movva was among the early physicians to introduce this paradigm shift to India nearly a decade ago - a philosophy that is already mainstream worldwide and now rapidly growing across India.A new era in Orthopaedics“Orthopaedics traditionally focused on cutting, replacing, or permanently altering anatomy,” Dr Movva says. “Regenerative Orthopedics asks whether we can activate the body’s own repair pathways before making irreversible decisions.”This approach now addresses conditions that were once considered surgical-only in many cases, including:“In appropriately selected patients, we are not just managing pain - we are supporting tissue repair and helping patients return to activity sooner,” he explains.Dr Movva, tell us about your journey and what led you to regenerative Orthopedics.My path into regenerative Orthopedics began with a simple question: Can we help the body heal itself before moving to surgery?After years of treating athletes and active individuals with joint and spine injuries, it became clear that many patients wanted solutions that preserved their natural anatomy whenever possible. That shift in perspective led to a focus on biologic therapies designed to support the body’s own repair systems.The body already contains powerful healing elements - platelets, bone marrow stem cells, and growth factors. When carefully concentrated and precisely delivered, they can stimulate repair in a way that works with the body rather than replacing it.At RegenOrthoSport , the philosophy is straightforward and patient-centered:Repair. Regenerate. Preserve.For patients, that means exploring thoughtful, stage-based options aimed at reducing pain, restoring function, and potentially delaying or avoiding surgery - while helping them return to the activities they love with confidence.Regenerative Orthopedics uses a patient’s own bone marrow stem cells, platelets, growth factors, and cytokines to repair damaged joints, tendons, ligaments, and discs without surgery. These cells are harvested, concentrated, and injected precisely into the injured area using live ultrasound and fluoroscopic X-ray guidance.The goal is to regenerate tissue while preserving natural structures instead of cutting or replacing them. Only autologous (self-derived) cells are used, in accordance with ICMR guidelines - no donor tissue, no implants, and no hospital admission. Patients typically return home the same day, followed by structured rehabilitation.High-Concentration Platelets are derived from a patient’s own blood and concentrated 16–18 times to release growth factors that accelerate tissue repair. They are often ideal for early inflammation, tendonitis, and mild soft-tissue injuries.Bone Marrow Stem Cell therapy uses concentrated stem cells harvested from the iliac crest to support repair in structural damage - such as cartilage degeneration, meniscus tears, disc pathology, or early arthritis - where platelets alone may not be sufficient.The choice depends on clinical evaluation, biomechanics, and MRI analysis. Treatment must be tailored to the patient, not just the scan.The knee remains the most commonly treated joint, including cartilage injuries, meniscus tears, ACL injuries, and early-to-moderate osteoarthritis.Spine conditions such as disc bulges, herniations, degeneration, and sciatica are increasingly seen in younger adults. Shoulders, hips, ankles, and smaller joints are also addressed.In India, early-to-mid-stage AVN of the hip - often steroid-related - can be managed biologically before collapse occurs, potentially delaying or preventing joint replacement.These treatments preserve natural tissue, avoid implants, and do not cause permanent structural changes. They are minimally invasive, performed under local anesthesia, and generally carry lower risks compared to surgical intervention.Recovery is often measured in weeks rather than months. Importantly, if outcomes are not optimal, surgical options remain available.RegenOrthoSport is guided by the following clinical standards:Standardised biologic preparation across all centres.Image-guided, diagnosis-driven treatment with structured rehabilitation.Exclusively patient-derived biologics; no donor or foreign materials.Ongoing evaluation of safety and efficacy.Strict adherence to governmental and ICMR guidelines.Systematic tracking of functional and patient-reported results.Protocols continuously updated based on scientific literature and real-world data.Regenerative Orthopedics is no longer a theoretical concept. It is a rapidly expanding, research-backed field with increasing global adoption. The next decade is expected to bring bioengineered scaffolds, cell-seeded injectables, targeted biologic delivery systems, and 3D bioprinting using a patient’s own cells.As musculoskeletal disease increases alongside longer life expectancy, regenerative Orthopedics is no longer viewed as a fringe alternative, but as an integrated, evidence-supported approach to joint preservation.For patients facing the prospect of irreversible surgery, the question is no longer simply, “What can be removed or replaced?” - but rather, “Can this be repaired and preserved?”In many cases, modern regenerative medicine suggests the answer is yes.","Regenerative Orthopedics uses a patient’s own bone marrow stem cells, platelets, growth factors, and cytokines to repair damaged joints, tendons, ligaments, and discs without surgery. These are harvested, injected into the injured area using live ultrasound and fluoroscopic X-ray guidance.

'Modi Is A Great...': Trump’s HUGE UPDATE On India-US Trade Deal Amid ‘Tariff War’ With SCOTUS

Trump responds with new tariffs

Impact on importers and global trade

Will tariffs be paid back?

What’s next?

The US Supreme Court ruled that President Donald Trump cannot legally use emergency powers under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose tariffs. The decision blocks part of his trade strategy but does not end his trade war.The ruling mainly affects “reciprocal tariffs,” which Trump announced last April in the Rose Garden. These tariffs had raised average rates to about 15%, but the court’s decision could cut that by more than half.Other tariffs, such as sector-specific levies on steel, pharmaceuticals, and autos under trade deals like the UK agreement, remain in place. Overall, the average tariff rate is still above 6%, about three times higher than at the start of 2025.For importers, the immediate impact may be limited. Many have already adapted supply chains to avoid heavily tariffed countries like China, or absorbed extra costs themselves. Last year, tariff revenues reached $240 billion, helping soften the effect on US households.Despite the ruling, Trump is pressing ahead. Hours after the decision, he announced a 10% global tariff and further investigations into unfair trade practices using the Trade Act of 1974.“We have other ways, numerous other ways,” he said.“While I am sure that they did not mean to do so, the Supreme Court's decision today made a president’s ability to both regulate trade and impose tariffs more powerful and more crystal clear, rather than less.”US treasury secretary Scott Bessent said the new measures are expected to “result in virtually unchanged tariff revenue in 2026.” However, these legal routes are more complex, with caps on tariff amounts and durations, and procedural steps such as investigations and hearings.Section 122 of the Trade Act allows tariffs of up to 15% for 150 days to address “fundamental international payments problems,” while other sections require investigations to determine if tariffs are needed for national security or to correct unfair trade practices.Donald Trump acknowledged that the new process takes longer. “The process takes a little more time, but the end result is going to get us more money,” he said. On existing trade deals, he added: “Many of them stand. Some of them won’t, and they’ll be replaced with the other tariffs.”Smaller US importers face ongoing uncertainty. Last year’s tariffs pushed companies to shift supply chains, benefiting countries like Thailand and Vietnam, while China remained strong due to IT hardware imports.The ruling also raises questions about whether the US will have to refund tariffs already collected.Economist Erin McLaughlin, as quoted by The Guardian, said that “many studies show that US firms have paid 90% of that,” often passing costs on to consumers.Trump dismissed the idea of refunds: “It’s not [being] discussed. We’ll end up being in court for the next five years.”The Supreme Court ruling removes one tool from Trump’s arsenal, but his broader trade strategy remains.The administration now faces a more complicated legal path to enforce tariffs, which may take time and involve investigations.Meanwhile, global trading partners may continue to seek more stable alliances, shifting supply chains and trade flows in response to ongoing uncertainty.","The US Supreme Court ruled that President Donald Trump cannot legally use emergency powers to impose tariffs.

"The $170Bn question: US SC junks Trump tariffs, but who will get the refunds?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/the-170bn-question-us-sc-junks-trump-tariffs-but-who-will-get-the-refunds/articleshow/128634212.cms,"Big Tariff Relief Likely For India Despite Trump's Defiance, White House Signals Global Trade Reset

What the SCOTUS said

After the US Supreme Court delivered a ruling invalidating the tariffs, the Trump administration has yet to give a clear response on what will happen to the billions of dollars US companies paid after Trump imposed tariffs on countries last year.This comes as the administration - both formally and informally - has promised refunds of duties collected. However, neither the administration nor the justices have specified how the process would work.With more than 3,00,000 businesses seeking refunds of $170 billion in tariffs, Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote during the hearing: “Refunds of billions of dollars would have significant consequences for the US Treasury.”“The Court says nothing today about whether, and if so how, the Government should go about returning the billions of dollars that it has collected from importers. But that process is likely to be a ‘mess,’ as was acknowledged at oral argument,” he added.That effectively means individual importers may have to file their own lawsuits for a chance at refunds, despite the government maintaining detailed records of tariff payments.Speaking to CNN, trade attorney Ted Posner, a partner at Baker Botts, said: “The case was never about refunds, and it was inconceivable that the Supreme Court would get into the weeds of how you apply refunds.”“We’re now talking to companies about the next steps, which means more waiting, this time for the Court of International Trade. Any refund process is going to require meticulous submissions, and for now, companies and even countries are left in limbo,” he added.Earlier, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Reuters that the agency has enough cash on hand to refund importers, but warned the process could take up to a year.“It won’t be a problem if we have to do it, but I can tell you that if it happens — which I don’t think it’s going to — it’s just a corporate boondoggle,” Bessent said.This would not be the first time the government has had to issue tariff refunds following a Supreme Court decision. A 1998 ruling resulted in $730 million in refunds to American companies, though the process took two years.Earlier on Friday, the US Supreme Court struck down President Donald Trump’s far-reaching global tariffs, handing him a significant setback on an issue central to his economic agenda.The 6–3 decision centred on tariffs imposed under an emergency powers law, including the sweeping reciprocal tariffs Trump levied on nearly every country.The majority held that the Constitution clearly grants Congress the power to impose taxes, including tariffs.Trump, however, said “nothing changes” in the trade deal with India following the verdict and responded by announcing an additional 10 per cent global levy on imports.Trump also lashed out at the justices who ruled against him, calling them “fools and lapdogs.”“The Supreme Court’s ruling on tariffs is deeply disappointing, and I’m ashamed of certain members of the Court — absolutely ashamed — for not having the courage to do what’s right for our country,” Trump said at a White House news conference.","The US Supreme Court struck down President Donald Trump’s far-reaching global tariffs, handing him a significant setback on an issue central to his economic agenda.

Warren Buffett's company invests in The New York Times 6 years after he sold all his newspapers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/warren-buffetts-company-invests-in-the-new-york-times-6-years-after-he-sold-all-his-newspapers/articleshow/128631977.cms,".

OMAHA: Six years after Warren Buffett sold off all of Berkshire Hathaway's newspapers and predicted unending declines for most of the industry, Berkshire disclosed a new $350 million investment in The New York Times on Tuesday.The somewhat surprising move highlighted the quarterly update Berkshire filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission about the company's stock holdings in Buffett's last quarter as CEO. Berkshire also increased its investment in Chevron just before President Donald Trump ordered the arrest of Venezuela's president, and the Omaha-based company continued selling off more of its Bank of America and Apple shares.At the time Buffett sold off Berkshire's dozens of newspapers in 2020 he concluded the industry was ""toast."" But even then he suggested that newspapers with a national brand like the Times or The Wall Street Journal might still do well.""It's a full circle moment for Berkshire Hathaway in reinvesting in news and a huge vote of confidence by Berkshire in the business strategy of The New York Times,"" said Tim Franklin, a professor and chair of local news at Northwestern University's Medill School of Journalism.Franklin said the Times may have its roots in the newspaper business, but today it's a thriving digital business with popular games like Wordle, a well-known sports platform called The Athletic and more than 12 million digital subscribers. He said maybe struggling local newspapers can draw some lessons from the ""digital news powerhouse"" the Times has become and find ways to offer online games and showcase the local sports coverage that readers can't get elsewhere.These quarterly stock portfolio filings don't make clear whether Buffett made every move or whether one of Berkshire's other investment managers did. Buffett generally handled any investments worth more than $1 billion, so at the size of this Times investment it's not certain whether this was one of his bets.But many investors will still try to copy it because of Buffett's remarkable track record over the decades before he handed the CEO title over to Greg Abel in January after six decades of leading Berkshire. Shares of the Times jumped nearly 3% in after hours trading after Berkshire disclosed the stake.Berkshire also picked up about 8 million more Chevron shares in the quarter to give it more than 130 million shares in the oil giant. That was a particularly well-timed bet because Chevron's stock has soared since Trump promised to reinvigorate Venezuela's oil business, but Buffett has long been bullish about the oil business and Berkshire has been a major investor in Chevron and Occidental Petroleum for several years.Chevron is the only major American oil company with significant operations in Venezuela, where it produces about 250,000 barrels a day. Chevron, which first invested in Venezuela in the 1920s, does business in the country through joint ventures with the state-owned company Petroleos de Venezuela SA, commonly known as PDVSA. Chevron's stock is up nearly 19% since the start of 2026 just before the US captured Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro in a raidThe other notable moves Berkshire made in the last three months of 2025 included selling off roughly 50 million Bank of America shares although it still holds nearly 81 million shares of the bank that he first started buying in 2011 while Bank of America was struggling with the effects of the subprime mortgage crisis. And Berkshire trimmed about 10 million shares off its massive Apple stake but continued to hold nearly 228 million shares at the end of last year.In addition to stocks, Berkshire owns dozens of companies outright including insurance giants like Geico, a collection of major utilities, BNSF railroad and many manufacturing and retail companies with brands like Dairy Queen and See's Candy.",Berkshire Hathaway disclosed a new $350 million investment in The New York Times on Tuesday.

Court blocks sweeping tariffs

Trump targets justices, including his own appointees

Defiant tone, new tariffs announced

Markets and global trade face renewed uncertainty

In a sharp rebuke to his trade agenda, US President Donald Trump lashed out at the Supreme Court of the United States on Friday after it struck down his sweeping global tariffs, calling the decision “ridiculous” and accusing some justices of undermining the country’s economic interests.In a strongly worded response, Trump said those members of the court who voted against what he described as a “very acceptable and proper method of tariffs should be ashamed of themselves,” adding that he would pursue alternative measures to impose new duties.The Supreme Court, in a 6–3 ruling written by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr, held that Trump had exceeded his legal authority when he imposed tariffs on nearly all US trading partners last year. The decision dealt a major blow to a cornerstone of Trump’s economic and trade policy, which relied heavily on tariffs to pressure foreign governments and reshape global supply chains.The majority found that the president’s use of emergency powers to justify the tariffs went beyond what Congress had authorized, effectively invalidating the broad measures that had targeted dozens of countries.Lashing out at the decision, the US president added in his series of Truth Social posts, ""To show you how ridiculous the opinion is, the Court said that I’m not allowed to charge even $1 DOLLAR to any Country under IEEPA, I assume to protect other Countries, not the United States which they should be interested in protecting — But I am allowed to cut off any and all Trade or Business with that same Country, even imposing a Foreign Country destroying embargo, and do anything else I want to do to them — How nonsensical is that? They are saying that I have the absolute right to license, but not the right to charge a license fee.What license has ever been issued without the right to charge a fee? But now the Court has given me the unquestioned right to ban all sorts of things from coming into our Country, a much more powerful Right than many people thought we had.""Read more: Trump reacts to US Supreme Court verdict invalidating his tariffs Trump singled out two justices he had appointed, Neil Gorsuch and Amy Coney Barrett, expressing frustration that they ruled against him despite his nomination.“What happened today with the two justices that I appointed against great opposition… never seems to happen with Democrats,” Trump said.He also criticised Chief Justice Roberts, accusing him of leading an effort that would allow foreign countries to continue “ripping us off,” while praising dissenting justices including Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, and Brett Kavanaugh for what he called their “strength, wisdom, and love of our country.”Further doubling on tariffs, Trump said, ""In actuality, while I am sure they did not mean to do so, the Supreme Court’s decision today made a President’s ability to both regulate Trade, and impose TARIFFS, more powerful and crystal clear, rather than less. There will no longer be any doubt, and the Income coming in, and the protection of our Companies and Country, will actually increase because of this decision. Based on longstanding Law and Hundreds of Victories to the contrary, the Supreme Court did not overrule TARIFFS, they merely overruled a particular use of IEEPA TARIFFS. The ability to block, embargo, restrict, license, or impose any other condition on a Foreign Country’s ability to conduct Trade with the United States under IEEPA, has been fully confirmed by this decision. In order to protect our Country, a President can actually charge more TARIFFS than I was charging in the past under the various other TARIFF authorities, which have also been confirmed, and fully allowed.""Also read: Why US Supreme Court struck down Donald Trump's trade tariffs; explained in 10 points Despite the setback, Trump struck a defiant tone, insisting his administration would move forward with new tariffs using alternative legal authorities. Within hours of the ruling, he announced plans to impose a fresh across-the-board 10 per cent tariff, signaling his intent to continue using trade measures as a central tool of economic policy.""Those members of the Supreme Court who voted against our very acceptable and proper method of TARIFFS should be ashamed of themselves. Their decision was ridiculous but, now the adjustment process begins, and we will do everything possible to take in even more money than we were taking in before!"" said Trump.Trump described tariffs as vital to national security and economic strength, claiming they had helped boost markets, reduce illicit drug flows, and pressure foreign governments.He also took digs at Democrats saying, ""The Democrats on the Court are thrilled, but they will automatically vote “NO” against ANYTHING that makes America Strong and Healthy Again. They, also, are a Disgrace to our Nation. Others think they’re being “politically correct,” which has happened before, far too often, with certain Members of this Court when, in fact, they’re just FOOLS and “LAPDOGS” for the RINOS and Radical Left Democrats and, not that this should have anything to do with it, very unpatriotic, and disloyal to the Constitution. It is my opinion that the Court has been swayed by Foreign Interests, and a Political Movement that is far smaller than people would think — But obnoxious, ignorant, and loud!""The ruling and Trump’s swift response injected fresh uncertainty into global markets and trade relations. Businesses and trading partners now face questions about the scope and legality of future US tariff actions, as well as the broader direction of American trade policy under Trump’s leadership.While the court’s decision represents a significant legal constraint on presidential tariff powers, Trump made clear that his administration would explore “methods, practices, statutes, and other authorities” to continue imposing trade barriers.The confrontation marks one of the most direct clashes between Trump and the Supreme Court, underscoring the high stakes surrounding tariffs and executive power in shaping US economic strategy.","US President Donald Trump lashes out at the Supreme Court of the United States after it struck down his sweeping global tariffs.

US President Donald Trump has announced to have imposed a global tariff of 10% on all international imports into the United States. This comes the US Supreme Court struck down his sweeping and often arbitrary duties, delivering a stinging rebuke of his signature economic policy.Announcing the move on his social media platform, Truth Social, Trump said the order would be “effective almost immediately.”He wrote, ""It is my Great Honor to have just signed, from the Oval Office, a Global 10% Tariff on all Countries, which will be effective almost immediately.""Expressing his displeasure with the Supreme Court's order, he ridiculed the decision, stating he shall begin the ""adjustment process"" and will be incorporating measures to ""take in more money than before.""On his Truth Social, he wrote, ""Those members of the Supreme Court who voted against our very acceptable and proper method of TARIFFS should be ashamed of themselves. Their decision was ridiculous but, now the adjustment process begins, and we will do everything possible to take in even more money than we were taking in before!""Earlier, while outlining his decision, Trump cited Section 122 and said he would also initiate investigations under Section 301 of the US Trade Act, which allows tariffs in response to unfair foreign trade practices.Speaking at a press conference, he said, ""Today, I will sign an order to impose a 10% global tariff under Section 122, over and above our normal tariffs already being charged, and we're also initiating several Section 301 and other investigations to protect our country from unfair trading practices.""The new tariff is set to take effect on February 24 and will remain in place for 150 days. Exemptions will continue for sectors currently under separate investigations, including pharmaceuticals, as well as for goods entering the US under the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement, according to a White House factsheet.Trump’s latest move follows a year in which he imposed varying tariff rates to pressure and penalise countries, both allies and adversaries.However, the conservative-majority Supreme Court ruled 6–3 on Friday that a 1977 law Trump had relied on to impose sudden tariffs on individual countries, reshaping global trade flows, “does not authorise the President to impose tariffs.” Notably, Trump had nominated two of the justices who joined the majority opinion against him.Reacting angrily to the ruling, Trump alleged, without providing evidence, that the court had been influenced by foreign interests. ""I'm ashamed of certain members of the court, absolutely ashamed, for not having the courage to do what's right for our country,"" Trump told reporters.He further insisted that the judgment had, in fact, strengthened his authority. ""In order to protect our country, a president can actually charge more tariffs than I was charging in the past,"" Trump said, adding that the ruling left him ""more powerful.""Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, speaking at the Economic Club of Dallas, defended the alternative approach, saying it ""will result in virtually unchanged tariff revenue in 2026.""",US President Donald Trump has imposed a global tariff of 10% on all international imports into the United States. This comes after the US Supreme Court struck down his sweeping and often arbitrary duties.

‘Historic Embarrassment’ For Trump; US Supreme Court Blocks Global Tariffs In Shock Ruling

Why the court struck down Trump tariffs





1. The emergency law does not mention tariffs



2. No president had used IEEPA this way before



3. Tariffs are different from other emergency tools



4. Government reading would give sweeping power



5. Majority relied on the major questions doctrine



6. All six majority justices agreed on the core point



7. Roberts’ central conclusion



8. Some justices noted other tools exist in the law



9. Tariffs had broad economic effects



10. Decision creates legal and practical fallout



The US Supreme Court on Friday struck down many tariffs imposed by Donald Trump, ruling that a key emergency law he relied on does not give presidents the authority to impose such duties. The 6–3 decision was a major defeat for Trump and a relatively rare instance of the court checking his efforts in a second term that has relied heavily on tariffs as economic and foreign policy leverage against both allies and adversaries.The majority coalition brought together Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan, Neil Gorsuch, Amy Coney Barrett and Ketanji Brown Jackson. Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Brett Kavanaugh dissented.At the center of the case was the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), a 1977 statute that allows the president to regulate imports to address national security, foreign policy or economic threats. Trump had invoked the law to justify sweeping tariffs on nearly every country, citing “large and persistent” trade deficits and failures by China, Canada and Mexico to stem the flow of illicit fentanyl and other drugs into the United States.The court, however, concluded the law does not authorize tariffs.The ruling has wide economic and political implications. It raises the prospect that the administration may have to refund more than $100 billion in tariff revenue to importers and leaves unresolved how businesses or consumers affected by higher prices could be compensated. Trump reacted angrily and quickly moved to impose new tariffs under different laws, including the 1974 Trade Act, signaling the fight over presidential tariff powers is likely to continue.Also read | Nothing changes for India: Donald Trump's big statement on trade deal Trump also said the court decision would not affect the ongoing India–US trade deal. Speaking after announcing a new 10% global tariff, he said the arrangement with India would remain unchanged and that New Delhi would continue paying tariffs while the United States would not.“Nothing changes, they'll be paying tariffs, and we will not be paying tariffs. So, the deal with India is they pay tariffs. This is a reversal for what it used to be. I think Prime Minister Modi is a great gentleman, a great man, actually, but he was much smarter than the people that he was against in terms of the United States. He was ripping us off, India. So we made a deal with India, it's a fair deal now, and we are not paying tariffs to them and they are paying tariffs. We did a little flip,"" said Trump.IEEPA authorises the president to “regulate … importation” to address unusual and extraordinary threats to national security, foreign policy or the economy. But the statute does not use the words tariff, duty, levy or tax, which the court said was significant.The majority stressed that before Donald Trump, presidents had not understood IEEPA to allow tariffs. That history supported the view that Congress never granted such power in the law.The court said tariffs differ from actions like quotas or embargoes because they “operate directly on domestic importers to raise revenue for the Treasury,” placing them outside the statute’s intended scope.Under the administration’s interpretation, the court said, a president could impose duties “of unlimited amount and duration, on any product from any country,” a level of authority the justices said Congress had not clearly granted.Three conservative justices in the majority — Roberts, Gorsuch and Barrett — applied the principle that major economic or political powers claimed by the executive must be clearly authorised by Congress.Despite differences in reasoning, all six concluded that IEEPA is silent on tariff authority and historically was not understood to include it.Chief Justice John Roberts wrote: “Our task today is to decide only whether the power to ‘regulate … importation,’ as granted to the president in IEEPA, embraces the power to impose tariffs. It does not.”The opinion said IEEPA allows measures such as quotas or embargoes on imports during emergencies, but that does not mean tariffs — a separate and revenue-raising instrument — are included.The struck-down tariffs had pushed up prices of imported goods including furniture, apparel and electronics. Economists said prices may not fall quickly because Trump is already pursuing replacement tariffs and companies may keep prices high amid uncertainty.The ruling opens the door to possible refunds of more than $100 billion in tariff revenue to importers, with lower courts, the US Court of International Trade, Customs and Border Protection and the Treasury Department expected to oversee the process. Importers are directly eligible, while other businesses may seek reimbursement through lawsuits; compensation for consumers is unclear.Within hours of the decision, Trump announced he would impose a new 10% tariff on all imports starting February 24 by invoking Section 122 of the 1974 Trade Act, a provision no president had previously used, and said he would pursue further tariffs through Section 301 investigations into other countries’ trade practices.","The US Supreme Court on Friday struck down many tariffs imposed by Donald Trump.

MEA Clears India's Position On Russian Oil After US Envoy Conveys Trump's Wish On Venezuelan Oil

New Delhi: Crude oil imports from Saudi Arabia have hit their highest levels since Nov 2019, clocking nearly 1-1.1 million barrels per day (bpd) in Feb, and overtaking Russia temporarily to emerge as the biggest supplier to India.According to data shared by Kpler, a global data and analytics service provider, crude imports from the West Asian country peaked at 1.3 million barrels on Feb 20 (Friday), eclipsing Russian supplies of about 1.1 mbd. Saudi Arabia has consistently held the third or fourth position in India's crude import basket over the past couple of years, with Russia remaining on top and Iraq and the UAE occupying the other two spots.The recent surge has significantly narrowed the gap between Riyadh and Moscow that widened after India ramped up Russian oil purchases following the Ukraine invasion. The numbers come amid mounting pressure from the US to reduce Russian crude purchases.""We expect some moderation in the coming weeks, with a few parcels likely slipping into early March. On a full-month basis, our predictive flows model currently indicates Saudi imports averaging closer to 1-1.1 mbd in Feb, still a multi-year high,"" said Sumit Ritolia, lead research analyst at Kpler.He said Russian crude imports are expected to be 1-1.2 mbd in Feb and may fall to 0.8-1 mbd a day in next month. ""However, we continue to see this as a short-term stabilisation. .. we expect Russia's share in India's crude slate to gradually stabilise at a lower range in 2026 compared to 2024 and 2025 as commercial and policy frictions build,"" he said. The analyst added Russian imports are expected to dip further in April as Nayara's Vadinar refinery, heavily dependent on Russian crude following EU sanctions, is scheduled for maintenance in April-May.","Crude oil imports from Saudi Arabia have hit their highest levels since Nov 2019, clocking nearly 1-1.1 million barrels per day in Feb.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor (CEA) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country. CEA said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-105332515,imgsize-39018,width-400,resizemode-4/v-anantha-nageswaran.jpg"
E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran Udaan until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.Udaan built an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business still accounts for a very small part of India’s overall retail market but can balloon to $150 billion in sales and yield a 100% return on capital invested in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co. estimates published in the Mint newspaper.Bengaluru-based Udaan has also ventured into financing through its fintech unit which helps shopkeepers get working capital loans to buy inventory. That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says.

Explainer: What is 'Hindu rate of growth' and why Raghuram Rajan's remarks may be 'premature',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/explainer-what-is-hindu-rate-of-growth-and-why-raghuram-rajans-remarks-may-be-premature/articleshow/98482598.cms,"What is meant by Hindu growth rate

How India's GDP has been growing

What SBI report said on savings and investment

Incremental capital output ratio

NEW DELHI: India's gross domestic product (GDP) data for the third quarter (October-December 2022) received a word of caution from the former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan In an interview with news agency PTI, Rajan that India is ""dangerously close"" to the Hindu rate of growth in view of subdued private sector investment, high interest rates and slowing global growth.India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying"".However, a report released by the State Bank of India (SBI) economists on Tuesday dismissed arguments that India is dangerously close to Hindu rate of growth saying such statements are ""ill-conceived, biased and premature"".The term 'Hindu growth rate' was coined by late economist Raj Krishna in 1978 to describe the slow growth in the country.It basically refers to the low pace of economic growth rates during 1950s to 1980s. During this period, the Indian economy averaged 3.5%.A former lecturer at the Delhi School of Economics (DSE), Krishna noted that only if the rate of growth is persistently slow and accompanied by low per-capita GDP, then it will be known as Hindu rate of growth but it has to factor in population growth as well.Before economic reforms of 1991, India's economic growth remained stagnant and low, while per capita income averaged around 1.3%.Krishna termed this low growth situation to be a result of socialist policies of state control and import substitution.However, the economic situation changed when liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation (LPG) reforms came into effect in the year 1991, at a time when India faced balance of payment crisis.Over the years, many economists have strongly opposed the idea of 'Hindu growth rate' and the term never had universal acceptance.The Indian economy plunged into its very first technical recession in FY21 due to the impact of Covid-19 pandemic and the related nationwide lockdowns. GDP shrunk by an unprecedented 23.8% in the first quarter of the financial year 2020-21. However, due to spurt in economic activities in the subsequent quarters, the GDP decline started to narrow.However, if we look at the period before Covid-19 as well, India's growth curve shows a declining trend.From 8.26% in FY17, GDP growth plunged to 3.74% in FY20. Shutdown of economic activities in FY21 in wake of Covid-19 only made matters worse.As lockdowns started to ease and business activities resumed, India's GDP also started rising. In Q1 of FY22, growth jumped to 20.1% mainly on account of low base effect. By the fourth quarter of FY22, growth came down to 4.10%.Similarly, the new financial year 2022-23 brought fresh economic challenges in the form of Russia-Ukraine war that impacted almost all major economies of the world, slowed the pace of growth, pushed inflation to record highs.As a result, the central banks of all advanced economies spurred into action and opted for monetary policy tightening to curb the soaring inflation.With persistently rising interest rates, India's economy grew by 4.4% in Q3 of FY23, as the Centre revised upwards GDP growth for previous year to 9.10% from 8.7% earlier.The report weighed recent GDP numbers against the available data on savings and investments for the past decade and highlighted some interesting points.""Quarterly growth numbers are noisy and should be best avoided for any serious interpretation (on an average, India's GDP growth has witnessed Rs 2 lakh crore upward revision for the 3 year ended FY23),"" the report said.Gross capital formation (GCF) by the government touched a high of 11.8% in 2021-22, up from 10.7% in 2020-21.""This also had a domino effect on private sector investment that jumped from 10 per cent to 10.8% over the same period,"" it said.In fact, Ecowrap added that the trends in GCF to gross output ratio or the plough back of funds for creation of fresh capacity shows that for public administration the ratio attained fresh peak in 2021-22 owing to the emphasis on capital expenditure in recent budgets.At the aggregate level, gross capital formation is supposed to have crossed 32% in 2022-23, the highest level since 2018-19.According to the report, in 2021-22, gross savings have risen to 30% from 29% in 2020-21.""The ratio is supposed to have crossed 31 per cent in 2022-23, the highest since 2018-19. The household savings increased sharply during the pandemic period on account of sharp accretion in financial savings such as deposits,"" said the report by SBI's Economic Research Department.While household financial savings have since then moderated from 15.4% in 2020-21 to 11.1% in 2022-23, savings in physical assets have grown sharply to 11.8% in 2021-22 from 10.7% in 2020-21.The report further analysed Incremental Capital Output ratio (ICOR) -- which measures additional units of capital (investment) needed to produce additional units of output. It said that the ratio has been improving.""ICOR which was 7.5 in FY 12 is now only 3.5 in FY22. Clearly, only half of capital is now needed for next unit of output,"" the report noted.Such reducing ICOR in the current years reflects a relatively increasing efficiency of capital and shows that the economy is on a sound footing, the report said.""From that point of view, future GDP growth rates even at 7% could still mean a decent number by any standards!,"" it added.","India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.

An employee is entitled for a 50 per cent amount of the last drawn salary as pension.OPS was discontinued by the NDA government in 2003 with effect from April 1, 2004.Under the new pension scheme (NPS), employees contribute 10 per cent of their basic salary towards pension while the government contributes 14 per cent.Governments of Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand have informed the central government/ Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA about their decision to restart OPS for their employees.The government of Punjab on November 18, 2022, issued a notification regarding implementation of OPS for the state government employees who are being covered under NPS. Jharkhand too has decided to revert to OPS.",Former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan has expressed his concern over the decision of some states to restart the old pension scheme.

The meeting was chaired by Food Secretary Sanjeev Chopra.Out of the total wheat procurement target for the 2022-23 marketing year (April-March), Punjab will aim to procure 2.5 million tonnes wheat, Haryana 1.5 million tonnes and Madhya Pradrsh 2 million tonnes, the food ministry said in a statement.Wheat procurement had declined last year due to a fall in domestic production and higher exports.However, the government has projected a record wheat production at 112.18 million tonnes in the 2023-24 crop year (July-June) as per the second estimate of the agriculture ministry.Besides wheat, the government has also fixed rabi (winter) rice procurement target at 10.6 million tonnes in the 2022-23 marketing year.States have been advised to enhance rice milling capacity so that milling of one season gets completed before the commencement of next season and recycling of rice may be avoided.Whereas procurement of millets and coarse grains is estimated to be 7,50,000 tonnes this year, higher than 6,30,000 tonnes in 2021-22. Karnataka will procure 6,00,000 tonnes of millets this year, the statement added.Separately addressing the conference, food minister Piyush Goyal urged all state governments to implement smart-PDS at the earliest.He lauded Andhra Pradesh government's Command Control and stated that the central government will work together for implementing it in other states also.On the storage front, the Union minister said FCI is upgrading godowns into five-star rated ones and state governments can also upgrade their godowns.In the conference, all the state governments were told to learn from the best practice of using millets in schemes like mid-day meal and PDS in Karnataka, which is helpful in adding nutrition and promoting healthy diet.States were encouraged to procure more millets and coarse grains. All the state governments were asked to open procurement centres for coarse grains in producing districts, especially, in tribal areas. State governments were asked to encourage consumption of coarse grains as well.The conference also deliberated on fighting anaemia and nutritional deficiencies in various parts of the country by suitably creating awareness on benefits of fortified rice.The issues related to smart Public Distribution System (PDS) and One Nation One Ration Card scheme for seamless delivery of foodgrains to migrant beneficiaries were also discussed.FCI (Food Corporation of India) is the government's nodal agency that undertakes procurement and distribution of foodgrains for the PDS and welfare schemes.The best practice of command control centre by Andhra Pradesh for real time data on procurement, storage, quality and distribution of foodgrains was also discussed, for which all states have been urged to learn and adopt the methods to make their systems effective and efficient.Further, implementation of additional minimum threshold parameters for online procurement operations, i.e. integration of power validation of milled rice quantity with electricity consumption and tracking of vehicles used for transporting food grains were also deliberated upon for improving efficiency and transparency in procurement operations.During the discussion, it emerged that sufficient jute bags are available as per requirement of ensuing season. Issues related to finalisation of audited accounts, food subsidy claims and rationalisation of food subsidy was also deliberated upon.State governments have also been asked to submit their pending bills to FCI so that those can be settled in March 2023.",The government has fixed a wheat procurement target of 34.15 million tonnes for the 2023-24 marketing year starting April. The target was fixed in the meeting of state food secretaries held alongside state food ministers' conference here to discuss procurement arrangements.Wheat procurement had declined last year due to a fall in domestic production and higher exports.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-98373075,imgsize-189632,width-400,resizemode-4/98373075.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Consumption of petrol, diesel and jet fuel continued to gallop apace in February, prompted by early onset of summer and harvesting pushing up demand from the farm sector and increased mobility prompted by expanding economic activities.Early trade data shows petrol consumption rising 13%, diesel 12% and jet fuel almost 41% over the same month a year ago. Consumption of LPG , mostly used by households for cooking, grew maintained the usual modest growth at 2.4%.The growth in consumption was substantially higher than in the same month of 2021 when the economy began firing up after the pandemic.

Since diesel a key indicator economic activities, this indicates lingering pandemic overhang.In contrast, petrol sales show a sharp uptick at 20% versus February 2020 as people’s preference for personal vehicles during the post-pandemic unlock period continues as reflected in robust automobile sales.Similarly, jet fuel sales have gradually recovered but still remains 10% short of the February 2020 level, indicating some resistance at this level. Industry is banking on the summer travel season for full recovery.Sequentially also, the sales in February were higher by 13.5% for petrol, 9.2% for diesel and just 3.3% for jet fuel, the data shows.Early onset of summer and absence of winter rains have pushed up demand from the farm sector due to increased use of diesel pumps for irrigating late standing crops such as mustard. Harvesting in states that have early harvesting further boosted the demand.","Petrol consumption rose 13%, diesel 12% and jet fuel almost 41% over the same month a year ago.

India's manufacturing PMI shows steady growth in February,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/indias-manufacturing-pmi-shows-steady-growth-in-february/articleshow/98327500.cms,"NEW DELHI: The growth momentum in India's manufacturing sector was maintained in February, with new orders and output increasing at similar rates to January, according to a monthly survey. The seasonally adjusted S&P Global India Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) was at 55.3 in February, little-changed from 55.4 in January.The February PMI data pointed to an improvement in overall operating conditions for the 20th straight month. In PMI parlance, a print above 50 means expansion while a score below 50 indicates contraction.""India's manufacturing industry sustained robust growth of output and new orders halfway through the final fiscal quarter, albeit with a notable slowdown in the rate of international sales expansion,"" the survey released on Wednesday said.Companies signalled only mild pressure on their own operating capacities, with outstanding business increasing marginally in February and accordingly job numbers expanded only fractionally.As per the survey, 98 per cent of panellists reported no change in employment. Job creation failed to gain meaningful traction as firms reportedly had sufficient staff to cope with current requirements, said Pollyanna De Lima, Economics Associate Director at S&P Global Market Intelligence.The domestic market was the main source of new business growth, as new orders from abroad increased only fractionally. The rise in international sales was the weakest in the current 11-month period of expansion.""... most of the upturn in new orders welcomed by firms was domestically driven as international sales rose at a marginal pace that was the weakest in almost a year,"" Lima said.On the prices front, input cost inflation accelerated to a four-month high, with firms mentioning higher prices for electronic components, energy, foodstuff, metals and textiles.""After slipping to a 26-month low last November, input cost inflation surged in every month since. The latest rise was historically subdued, however, and among the weakest in around two years.""The survey showed some reluctance among manufacturers to pass on cost increase to clients, with output charge inflation easing since January,"" Lima said.Meanwhile, business confidence improved in February, with firms expecting demand strength, new product releases and investments to bode well for growth prospects.The S&P Global India Manufacturing PMI is compiled by S&P Global from responses to questionnaires sent to purchasing managers in a panel of around 400 manufacturers.

Sam Bankman-Fried acknowledges 'mistakes' but testifies he did not defraud anyone,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/cryptocurrency/sam-bankman-fried-acknowledges-mistakes-but-testifies-he-did-not-defraud-anyone/articleshow/104761929.cms,"Sam Bankman-Fried (File Photo- Reuters)





NEW YORK: Sam Bankman-Fried, testifying in his own defense at his fraud trial on Friday, acknowledged that a ""lot of people got hurt"" when the FTX cryptocurrency exchange he founded collapsed, but said he did not defraud anyone or take customer funds.Shortly after taking the witness stand in Manhattan federal court, Bankman-Fried said he made ""a number of small mistakes and a number of larger mistakes"" while running the now-bankrupt exchange. The biggest mistake, he said, was not implementing a dedicated risk management team.""We thought that we might be able to build the best product on the market,"" Bankman-Fried said. ""It turned out basically the opposite of that. A lot of people got hurt - customers, employees - and the company ended up in bankruptcy.""Prosecutors accuse Bankman-Fried of using FTX customer funds to prop up his crypto-focused hedge fund, Alameda Research, make speculative venture investments and donate more than $100 million to US political campaigns. He also faces charges of scheming to cheat Alameda's lenders and FTX investors.He has pleaded not guiltyBankman-Fried's trial, which began on October 3, is drawing to a close nearly a year after FTX collapsed amid a wave of customer withdrawals.The company declared bankruptcy in November 2022 and Bankman-Fried was indicted the following month.His testimony marked the first time the dozen jurors and five alternates have heard directly from the 31-year-old former billionaire after 12 trial days.Bankman-Fried, who was jailed in August after US District Judge Lewis Kaplan found he likely tampered with witnesses, wore a suit and spoke with two water bottles placed in front of him on the witness stand. The former mogul once known for wearing shorts and T-shirts and sporting an unkempt mop of curly locks cut his hair before his trial began.Responding to questions posed by his defense lawyer Mark Cohen, Bankman-Fried spoke in calm, measured tones during the first portion of his testimony as he recounted founding Alameda in 2017, shortly after graduating from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, despite knowing little about crypto.But Bankman-Fried - who had studied physics and worked as a quantitative trader at Jane Street - said he saw opportunities for ""arbitrage"" in the market for digital assets. He said Alameda's first office was in a small Airbnb in Berkeley, California, before he later moved the firm to Hong Kong.""We wanted to be under the radar at that point in time,"" he said on the stand, adding he named the hedge fund after the California county where it was founded in part so competitors would not discover what they were doing.Jurors have heard from three of his closest confidantes at FTX and Alameda, all of whom have pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors. They testified earlier this month that they committed financial crimes at Bankman-Fried's behest.For criminal defendants, taking the stand is a risky proposition because it opens them up to potentially probing cross-examination by prosecutors.But given Bankman-Fried's penchant for risk, legal experts say he likely viewed taking the stand as his best shot to counter the allegations made by members of his inner circle, which were backed up by spreadsheets the three said demonstrated how customer funds were stolen and text messages in which they discussed FTX's shortfall of funds with Bankman-Fried.","Sam Bankman-Fried says he made ""a number of small mistakes and a number of larger mistakes"" He acknowledged that a ""lot of people got hurt"" when the FTX cryptocurrency exchange he founded collapsed, but said he did not defraud anyone or take customer funds.

"Crypto isn’t dead, it’s evolving rapidly to create a new world",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/cryptocurrency/crypto-isnt-dead-its-evolving-rapidly-to-create-a-new-world/articleshow/101324954.cms,"Regulatory landscape



There are few technologies as confusing to most people as crypto and blockchain. The tech and regulations underpinning it are evolving so rapidly, it is difficult for even technologists to often make sense of it.Crypto assets and crypto currencies are based on blockchain tech, which is a form of distributed ledger technology that stores data on thousands of data servers around the world, as opposed to today where data is stored only in one place or clustered in a few locations. This data is open, meaning it can be viewed and verified by anyone taking part in that particular system. What this means practically is that an individual can transfer crypto assets without the help of intermediaries, say, banks or government agencies, thereby ensuring privacy, speed and lower costs.The first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin , was created with anonymity in mind, it was a way for people to conduct financial transactions away from the prying eyes of governments. While it went on to become a speculative asset, today, crypto, and the underlying blockchain technology, has a far more ambitious goal – the transformation of the internet.CoinDCX CTO Vivek Gupta says this technology can help usher in Web 3. 0 – a decentralised form of the internet where users can actually monetise their time spent online.“Whatever Web3 use case you may be driving, the value that comes from it must be distributed, and you cannot distribute that without crypto. For something as simple as depositing money in a pool and getting a receipt token, that receipt token is a crypto. That’s the proof that I have deposited the money. Without crypto there is no Web3 use case,” he says.Decentralised finance (DeFi) is a huge part of what makes blockchain tech so disruptive. Imagine being able to lend your money to strangers on the internet and get paid an interest. Or imagine spending time on socialmedia platforms or playing video games and getting paid for your time spent by someone who needs data about you. Web3 makes this possible because the data isn’t controlled by any one company or country.Decentralised apps (dApps) are another Web3 feature. Unlike traditional apps hosted on centralised servers, dApps operate on a peer-to-peer network and utilisethe consensus mechanism and transparency features of blockchain technology.“I see a big disruption coming, especially in the DeFi tokenisation space and the whole content creator economy,” says Ravi Chamria, co-founder & CEO of Zeeve, a blockchain automation platform.Ashish Singhal, co-founder & CEO of CoinSwitch, says the tech can revolutionise how we conduct business, store data, and even vote, since the tech allows people to verify data of any kind efficiently.Governments are worried about what crypto could mean for monetary policy, for their ability to regulate people’s lives. But disruption hardly ever requires consensus. If a new technology proves to be better than an old one, people will drift towards it.Central banks have recognised the importance of the technology and some are creating Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) that are based on blockchain technology. “There’s a lot of activity happening in the regulated DeFi space. Looking at the future, we think guardrails are probably a good thing to have around these sorts of technologies,” says Andrew Vranjes, VP of sales at Blockdaemon, a blockchain infrastructure platform.Cryptocurrencies too are rapidly changing. Where before the value of cryptocurrencies were based on what people were willing to pay for them, today there are crypto assets that are backed by real world assets like equity and real estate. Silvina Moschini’s Unicoin is one of them. “It is an assets backed, audited, SEC-compliant cryptocurrency,” she says.","Crypto assets and crypto currencies are based on blockchain tech, which is a form of distributed ledger technology.

Bank Holidays September 2025: For those looking visit their bank branches on specific days in the upcoming month, it is important to note that several bank holidays could lead to extended weekends in some states. Planning ahead for your financial and branch-related work is advisable to avoid any inconvenience.All banks across India — both scheduled and non-scheduled — remain closed on the second and fourth Saturdays and all Sundays in general. Apart from these regular closures, a number of regional festivals and events will also be observed as holidays, according to RBI calendar.While physical branches will be closed on these days, customers can continue to use digital banking platforms including UPI, IMPS, NEFT, RTGS and ATMs without interruption.In September, major festivals such as Karma Puja, Onam, Id-e-Milad, Indrajatra, Navratra Sthapna and Durga Puja will impact bank operations in different states.However, since holidays differ across states, not every bank branch will be closed on the same day. For example, festivals such as Onam or Durga Puja are observed in certain regions and may not affect operations in others. This makes it important for customers to be aware of local holiday schedules to avoid last-minute disruptions in banking plans.These holidays vary from state to state and not all bank branches will remain shut on all the dates. Customers are advised to check with their local branch for clarity before planning visits.","All banks across India — both scheduled and non-scheduled — remain closed on the second and fourth Saturdays and all Sundays in general.

"Auto industry GST slabs: First-time buyers, middle-income families to gain; sector seeks clarity on cess",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/auto-industry-gst-slabs-first-time-buyers-middle-income-families-to-gain-sector-seeks-clarity-on-cess/articleshow/123695419.cms,"Diwali Gift for Consumers: Govt Slashes GST Across Sectors, Prices to Drop from Sept 22





The automobile industry has welcomed the GST Council’s decision to reduce tax rates on vehicles, calling it a timely step that will lift demand, make cars and two-wheelers more affordable, and particularly benefit first-time buyers and middle-income families.The new two-tier structure, announced on Wednesday, simplified levies to 5% and 18% from September 22, coinciding with the start of Navaratri.Industry leaders said the changes would inject fresh momentum into the sector and urged the government to quickly clarify rules on compensation cess on unsold vehicles to ensure a smooth transition.Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) President Shailesh Chandra said the industry is pleased with the decision to reduce GST on vehicles to 18% and 40%.“This timely move is set to bring renewed cheer to consumers and inject fresh momentum into the Indian automotive sector,” he told PTI.“Making vehicles more affordable, particularly in the entry-level segment; these announcements will significantly benefit first-time buyers and middle-income families, enabling broader access to personal mobility.”C S Vigneshwar, President of the Federation of Automobile Dealers’ Associations (FADA), described the changes as “bold and progressive reforms” that simplify the tax structure and create consensus across states.“This is a decisive step that will boost affordability, spur demand, and make India’s mobility ecosystem stronger and more inclusive,” he said. “As the country heads into the peak festive season, glitch-free and implementation will be the key to ensuring that the benefits seamlessly reach customers.”TVS Motor Company chairman Sudarshan Venu said the cut was a major move to turbocharge growth.“It will significantly boost consumption across segments of the society. For our industry especially, it is a welcome move as it will help two-wheelers become more accessible and also help those looking to upgrade,” he was cited by PTI.Chandra also welcomed the continuation of the 5% GST rate on electric vehicles, saying it “will help sustain the ongoing momentum towards sustainable mobility”. He added that resolving classification issues and correcting the inverted duty structure would streamline business processes and support ease of doing business.He further expressed confidence that “the government will also soon notify suitable mechanisms for the utilisation of compensation cess on unsold vehicles, ensuring a smooth and effective transition”.Vigneshwar expressed similar concern, pointing out that “one area that may need earliest clarification is about levy and treatment of cess balances currently lying in dealers’ books, so that there is no ambiguity during transition”.Under the revised slabs, petrol, LPG and CNG vehicles with engines up to 1,200 cc and under 4,000 mm in length, as well as diesel vehicles up to 1,500 cc and 4,000 mm, will be taxed at 18%, down from 28% plus cess.Motorcycles up to 350 cc will also be taxed at 18% instead of 28%, PTI reported.Larger vehicles – above 1,200 cc and longer than 4,000 mm – along with motorcycles above 350 cc and racing cars, will face a 40% levy. Small hybrid cars will benefit from lower rates, while electric vehicles will continue at the 5% slab.","The automobile industry has welcomed the GST Council’s decision to reduce tax rates on vehicles.

Stock market recommendations:Benchmark Indices witnessed a recovery in the first half of the current week and formed a high of 24,980 in Thursday session as the Government introduced significant changes to the GST structure aimed at boosting consumption. The earlier 12% and 28% tax slabs have been eliminated, with most items shifted into lower 5% and 18% brackets. In addition, a new 40% category has been created, which effectively absorbs the previous compensation cess, except for tobacco products. These revisions will be effective from 22 September.Indexes witnessed profit booking at higher levels around 25,000 levels on Thursday session and closed the session around 24,750 levels.Index in the immediate short term is likely to consolidate in the range of 24,400-25,000 amid stock specific actions. On the higher side a move above 25,000 levels will open further upside towards the key resistance area of 25,200-25,250 levels.Immediate support is placed at 24,400-24,337 levels being the confluence of the recent lows and the key retracement area. A breach below the same will signal acceleration of decline towards the key support area of 24,000-23,800 levels in the coming week being the confluence of the 52-week EMA and the previous major lows and the previous major breakout area.Bank Nifty is seen consolidating around 200 days EMA amid stock specific actions.Going ahead, we expect the index to move above Thursday's high (54,450) and open further upside towards a major breakdown area of 54,800-55,000. Overall, we expect the index to extend consolidation in the range 53,300-55,000 in the coming sessions.Bank Nifty has immediate support at 53,500-53,300 levels being the confluence of the 200 day EMA and the low of May 2025. A breach below the same will signal acceleration of decline towards the key support area of 52,500-52,000 levels in the coming weekThe stock after the recent corrective decline is forming base at the 200 day EMA and the previous breakout area thus offers fresh entry opportunity with favorable risk-reward set up.In the smaller time frame, it has generated a falling channel breakout containing the last 6 sessions corrective decline thus offers fresh entry opportunity. Strong support is placed in the range of 1290-1270 levels being the confluence of last month’s low and 200 days EMA.We expect stocks to head higher towards 1438 levels, being the 80% retracement of the previous July-August decline (1474-1291).The stock is in a strong up trend and is seen taking support at the 20 days EMA. We expect the stock to extend the up move thus offering a fresh entry opportunity.The stock has outperformed the overall market and is likely to extend its current outperformance.We expect the stock to head towards 67 levels in the coming month being the 123.6% external retracement of the previous decline (65-57). The daily stochastic remains in an up trend thus supports the positive bias.","According to Bajaj Broking Research, the top stock picks for September 5, 2025 are Adani Ports, and Jayaswal Neco Industries.

Diwali Gift for Consumers: Govt Slashes GST Across Sectors, Prices to Drop from Sept 22





The central government’s revenue loss from the recent GST rate cuts is projected to be only around Rs 3,700 crore in FY26, cushioned by stronger consumption and higher tax collections, according to a report by the State Bank of India (SBI).As per news agency ANI, the report noted that while the government, based on FY24 estimates, had earlier projected a gross revenue loss of Rs 93,000 crore from GST rationalisation, higher collections reduced the net loss to Rs 48,000 crore.For FY26, SBI expects the gross loss to rise to Rs 1.11 lakh crore, but with buoyant consumption and better compliance, the net loss is seen sharply lower at Rs 25,794 crore, including Centre and states’ share.For the Centre alone, the loss is significantly smaller. Using the FY24 baseline, the Centre’s share was Rs 6,960 crore, while for FY26 it is projected at Rs 3,740 crore, SBI said. “Based on the trend growth and consumption boost, we expect Rs 3,700 crore revenue loss in GST,” the report added, noting the fiscal impact is just about 1 basis point of the deficit.SBI highlighted that past GST rate cuts have often led to additional revenues of nearly Rs 1 trillion.It argued the latest reforms should be viewed as structural rather than a temporary stimulus, as the simplified framework is expected to reduce compliance burdens, widen the tax base, and encourage voluntary compliance.On inflation, the report estimated that reducing GST rates on around 295 essential items, many now under 5% or Nil, would lower CPI inflation in this category by 25–30 basis points in FY26. Further, rationalisation in services is expected to ease CPI by another 40–45 basis points, taking the overall moderation to 65–75 bps over FY26–27.Experts said the reforms, part of GST 2.0 approved by the GST Council on September 3, reflect a shift to demand-led growth. Essentials will now attract 5%, other goods 18%, and luxury/sin items 40%.As per news agency PTI, HSBC Global Research said the combination of GST changes, income tax cuts and benign inflation will create conditions for “sustained growth,” with GDP rising by up to 0.2 ppt.Jefferies said the GST cuts would help both consumers and companies at a time of weak demand, while Kotak Institutional Equities noted they could revive FMCG consumption. Standard Chartered said the GST reduction could lower inflation by 40–60 bps annually, while adding 0.1–0.16 ppt to GDP growth.Overall, analysts expect the reforms to spur consumption in sectors including consumer goods, retail, automobiles, cement, insurance, and renewables, while also giving a push to private capex after years of sluggishness.","The central government’s revenue loss from the recent GST rate cuts is projected to be only around Rs 3,700 crore in FY26.

Diwali Gift for Consumers: Govt Slashes GST Across Sectors, Prices to Drop from Sept 22





The sweeping GST reforms announced this week will give a major push to India’s cooperative and farm sectors by reducing costs, boosting demand, and raising incomes, the Ministry of Cooperation said in a statement.The ministry noted that the reforms will particularly benefit rural enterprises, farmer producer organisations (FPOs), and women-led self-help groups engaged in food and milk processing. “GST rate reductions will benefit cooperatives in farming and animal husbandry, promote sustainable farming practices, and benefit small farmers and FPOs. The NextGenGST reforms brought under the leadership of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi Ji has been hailed by the entire dairy cooperative sector, including the big cooperative brands like AMUL,” it said, ANI quoted.In the dairy sector, milk and paneer—whether branded or unbranded—have been exempted from GST, while the tax on butter, ghee, and similar products has been cut from 12% to 5%. GST on milk cans made of iron, steel, or aluminium has also been reduced from 12% to 5%. The ministry said these changes will make dairy products more competitive, provide direct relief to farmers and consumers, and strengthen women-led rural enterprises.Food processing has also received a major boost, with GST on cheese, namkeens, butter, and pasta lowered to 5%. Jams, jellies, yeasts, bhujia, and fruit pulp or juice-based drinks now attract 5% GST, while chocolates, corn flakes, ice creams, pastries, cakes, biscuits, and coffee have also seen a reduction from 18% to 5%. “Lower GST will reduce household expenditure on food items, stimulate demand in semi-urban and rural areas, and promote growth in the food processing and dairy cooperative sectors,” the ministry added.The reforms extend to agriculture inputs and logistics. GST on key fertiliser inputs such as ammonia, sulphuric acid, and nitric acid has been reduced from 18% to 5%, correcting the inverted duty structure and lowering input costs for fertiliser companies. Bio-pesticides and micronutrients have also seen a cut to 5%, which the government said will promote eco-friendly farming and benefit organic farmers under the Natural Farming Mission.Tractors below 1800 cc and their components such as tyres, tubes, and hydraulic pumps will now attract only 5% GST, down from 18%. The GST on commercial goods vehicles such as trucks and delivery vans has been lowered from 28% to 18%, which the ministry said will reduce freight costs and improve export competitiveness. In addition, GST on third-party insurance of goods carriage has been cut from 12% to 5% with input tax credit.The government described the reforms as “next-generation GST changes,” announced just days after Prime Minister Narendra Modi referred to them in his Independence Day speech. The GST Council approved the sweeping rate cuts, which the government has described as a Diwali gift for citizens.","The government described the reforms as “next-generation GST changes,” announced just days after Prime Minister Narendra Modi referred to them in his Independence Day speech.

For most Indians, the fear of outliving retirement savings looms larger than ever as life expectancy rises and medical costs climb. Picture this: your morning coffee in retirement, bills paid, lifestyle intact — and all of it supported by a steady Rs 1 lakh monthly income. Financial planners say this is possible, but the secret lies in building the right retirement corpus and matching it with your risk appetite.Depending on the investment route you choose, the required savings range from Rs 1 crore to Rs 2 crore. Safe options like annuities and fixed deposits can work with Rs 2 crore, while those willing to take higher risks may target the same income with just Rs 1 crore in diversified equity funds.To generate Rs 12 lakh annually, the required corpus depends on the rate of return. With Rs 2 crore, investors can choose safer instruments like annuities, debt funds or fixed deposits, which typically offer around 6% returns, according to an ET report. For those with Rs 1.5 crore, instruments offering 8% returns, such as the Senior Citizens’ Savings Scheme, balanced hybrid funds or equity savings funds, may be enough.According to Value Research data (September 2, 2025) quoted in the ET analysis, balanced hybrid and equity savings funds have delivered 8.80% and 8.10% CAGR respectively over the last decade.Risk-tolerant investors with Rs 1.2 crore can aim for products that generate about 10% returns, such as aggressive hybrid, large-cap or large-and-midcap funds, which have delivered 11.98%, 12.75% and 14.69% CAGR respectively in the last 10 years. At the highest-risk level, those with Rs 1 crore can still target Rs 12 lakh annual income by investing in flexicap or multicap funds, which have historically returned over 12% CAGR. Flexicap funds, for instance, gave 13.64% CAGR in the past decade.Table source: ETSome planners recommend strategies that preserve capital while providing inflation-adjusted returns. Rohan Goyal of MIRA Money suggests a 4–5% withdrawal rate, requiring Rs 2.4–3 crore to sustainably generate Rs 12 lakh annually. “A 4–5% withdrawal rate is low enough that portfolio growth should outpace withdrawals, making the corpus last decades,” he was quoted as saying.Arun Kumar of FundsIndia advises an 85:15 split between aggressive hybrid and arbitrage funds, with systematic withdrawal plans (SWPs) starting after one year. Withdrawals should pause if the market corrects sharply and shift temporarily to arbitrage funds, resuming later.Elever’s Karan Aggarwal suggests a glide-path approach: begin with a 50:50 split between debt and arbitrage funds, then shift 10% annually towards equity until the sixth year, when equity allocation reaches 50%.Tax treatment varies across instruments. Equity funds attract 15–20% short-term capital gains tax and 10–12.5% long-term capital gains tax, while debt funds face 20% with indexation or 12.5% without. Hybrid funds are taxed according to their asset mix, said CA Suresh Surana.A fixed withdrawal of Rs 1 lakh today may lose significant value over 10 years. SWPs that allow part of the corpus to remain invested and continue compounding can help balance current income with future security.Experts say there is no universal formula for securing Rs 1 lakh a month. “Start early, diversify across equity, debt and hybrid options, and review periodically,” one planner said. “What matters most is matching investments with risk appetite and keeping income inflation-adjusted.”","For most Indians, the fear of outliving retirement savings looms larger than ever as life expectancy rises and medical costs climb. Financial planners say this is possible, but the secret lies in building the right retirement corpus and matching it with your risk appetite. Depending on the investment route, the required savings range from Rs 1 crore to Rs 2 crore.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123738309,imgsize-1148737,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

NEW DELHI: GST cuts by govt have started to result in lower prices for consumers as companies cut prices across segments to pass on the benefits of reduced taxation. Car and two-wheeler companies as well as online platforms and FMCG sellers have started to pass on the benefits, especially as the tax cut has happened during the festive period.SUV major Mahindra & Mahindra on Saturday announced that it would ""pass on the full GST benefits to customers"" across its entire petrol/diesel portfolio. It said customers could avail of the lower prices, with a peak benefit of Rs 1.6 lakh on XUV3XO (diesel) from Saturday itself, instead of Sep 22 when the new tax rates come into effect.Price cuts have also been announced on company models such as Thar (upwards of Rs 1 lakh), Scorpio-N (Rs 1.45 lakh), and XUV700 (Rs 1.4 crore). Tata Motors on Friday announced price cuts from Sep 22. Renault has said it will slash prices, starting with Rs 53,695 on the Triber and the Kiger (higher on premium versions), and Rs 40,095 on the Kwid. ""We believe this timely initiative will not only make our cars more accessible but also energise demand during the festive season,"" Venkatram Mamillapalle, MD of Renault India, said.Classic Legends, which sells iconic bike brands such as Yezdi and Jawa, has also announced price cuts.""Govt's bold and timely GST reforms will bring a tectonic shift... We will pass on 100% of the GST benefit to our customers,"" Anupam Thareja, co-founder of Jawa Yezdi Motorcycles, said. Luxury brand BMW has also announced price cuts. For example, the BMW 3-Series will be priced lower by Rs 3.4 lakh and 5-Series by Rs 4.1 lakh.Flipkart has asked sellers on its platform to plan price revisions and pass on the GST cut benefits. ""You are required to plan revision of prices of the notified goods and services, wherein the rate of tax is proposed to be reduced. Failure to do so is an offence that can attract scrutiny from regulatory authorities,"" it said in a note. Queries sent to an Amazon spokesperson did not elicit a response.Flipkart and Amazon are launching their annual festive sales this year from Sep 23 (early access for members). Consumers have been deferring big ticket purchases to avail of the benefits of the new GST rates. FMCG companies, meanwhile, are awaiting guidelines from the govt on re-stickering, packaging and internally figuring out ways through which they will implement the changes on the ground.In consumer goods, a large part of the GST benefits will be passed through increase in grammage given that a lot of consumption in the industry happens through small packs where prices can't be meaningfully reduced.

"Rice exporters call GST reform economic catalyst; agri sector gains from quicker refunds, consumers to benefit",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/rice-exporters-call-gst-reform-economic-catalyst-agri-sector-gains-from-quicker-refunds-consumers-to-benefit/articleshow/123737545.cms,"



The next-generation Goods and Services Tax (GST) reforms will act as an economic catalyst, with significant benefits for agriculture and rice exports, according to Indian Rice Exporters Federation’s Vice President Dev Garg. Calling the move “not just a tax reform, it is an economic reform,” Garg said the measures would unlock growth opportunities, create jobs and strengthen the sector.Speaking to ANI, he highlighted that exporters had long faced bottlenecks in GST registration, which earlier took more than a month. “Firstly, the time limit for GST registration has now been reduced to three days. Earlier, it used to take more than 30 to 40 days and this was a very challenging aspect for any large exporter,” Garg said.He added that the reform would make exports more viable across multiple ports. “If we specifically talk about rice, an exporter may export from Kandla port, Vizag port, Mumbai port or Kakinada port… Earlier, if I didn’t have GST registration in Andhra Pradesh, it was very difficult to aggregate large quantities at the port warehouse and export it.”Another critical change is quicker refunds. “Any exporter would get provisional 90% refund within one week, which has been reduced from earlier 60 days to seven days.If we talk about the rice industry, more than Rs 1,230 crore of the rice industry are stuck under GST refunds. By bringing in this enabling provision, this amount will be unlocked for the industry which will reduce the working capital cycle,” Garg said.He also noted that GST rate cuts would stimulate demand. “This new change will also bring in a wave of fresh consumer demand as we have seen that for most consumer goods, the GST slab has been cut down. This will lead to increased demand from the consumer side,” he said.With India expecting a record rice harvest this Kharif season, Garg stressed the timing was crucial. “We anticipate that the crop for high value basmati and other varieties of Indian rice will result in a huge surplus stock situation. When there is a surplus, we need enhanced consumer demand to uplift the prices and keep the prices for paddy high during the harvest season so that farmers get their due,” he said.He argued that consumers will now have more purchasing power. “If earlier somebody was purchasing a low value rice variety of Rs 25 to 35 per kg, today because of this GST rate rationalisation, he will be able to shift to a higher variety of rice… basmati and other premium types.”On behalf of around 7,500 rice exporters, Garg thanked Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the government for implementing the reform, which was described by the GST Council as a “Diwali gift” after approving sweeping rate cuts across sectors including food staples, agriculture, education, healthcare, automobiles, electronics and insurance.","GST reforms will act as an economic catalyst, with significant benefits for agriculture and rice exports, says Indian Rice Exporters Federation’s Vice President Dev Garg.

India’s diesel exports to Europe surge

August Export Spike





The European Union’s new restrictions on Russia’s crude oil have led to a massive surge in diesel shipments from India. India's diesel shipments to Europe jumped 137% year-on-year, reaching 242,000 barrels per day (bpd) in August, as customers prepared for the European Union's upcoming restrictions on fuels processed from Russian crude starting January 2026.According to an ET report, the new rules could potentially restrict the market for Reliance Industries, India's primary processor of Russian oil and leading fuel exporter.Industry experts attributed this significant increase to several factors: an unexpected early maintenance schedule at a major refinery, anticipated winter requirements, and forthcoming EU regulations that might restrict Indian supplies. They anticipate European demand for Indian diesel to maintain strong levels throughout 2025.Also Read | The 50% misfire: How Trump made Russian oil cheaper for India - And Putin a winner According to Kpler, a global data and analytics service, August diesel exports to Europe increased 73% from last month and surpassed the past year's monthly average by 124%.Vortexa, another energy shipment monitoring firm, reported Indian diesel exports to Europe in August at 228,316 bpd, showing a 166% increase year-on-year and 36% growth from July.Different shipping data monitors often provide varying export figures.The surge in late August shipments, particularly to Rotterdam, seems to be compensating for the shortfall caused by unexpected refinery maintenance, Sumit Ritolia, lead research analyst, refining and modelling at Kpler was quoted as saying by ET. ""Exports rose sharply as Shell's Pernis (Netherlands) refinery advanced its planned turnaround from 2026. This has surprised the market,"" he said.One industry expert suggested that the early maintenance schedule could be a strategic move anticipating the post-January situation, when European markets may cease accepting Indian petroleum products refined from Russian crude.Also Read | 'One-sided' trade myth: Why Donald Trump is wrong - How US profits big from India US officials have strongly criticised India, alleging that its refineries are generating excessive profits by purchasing Russian crude at discounted rates and selling the processed products to Western nations, thus indirectly supporting Moscow's military operations.India has dismissed these allegations, stating that Western nations have the option to stop purchasing Indian fuel products if they have concerns.India's exporters anticipate robust demand from Europe throughout this year. ""European buyers may accelerate liftings from India given that Middle Eastern refineries will be having a high maintenance in October-November, echoing the stockpiling seen ahead of the February 2023 EU ban on Russian products,"" Ritola said.Europe relies heavily on Middle Eastern refineries as crucial suppliers.India's diesel exports witnessed a significant increase, reaching 603,000 bpd in August, showing an approximate 17% rise compared to both July and the previous year's figures, as reported by Kpler, primarily due to increased European shipments.The EU's July sanctions announcement stipulated that importers must present proof of crude origin used in refined products from third countries. However, the practical implementation of these import restrictions remains unclear.Also Read | Reality check for Trump! Why blame India for Russian crude trade?

Employment data for August revealed significant weakening in US job market conditions, with unemployment climbing to 4.3%, marking a nearly four-year peak.This development strengthens expectations for a Federal Reserve interest rate reduction this month, according to Reuters.The Friday employment report further disclosed June's first job losses in four and a half years, raising concerns about economic stagnation. Job creation has declined since April, with analysts attributing this to governmental policies, including import tariffs, stricter immigration controls, and substantial public sector redundancies.""The economy is skating as close to the edge of recession as you can get,"" said Christopher Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS. ""Companies are clearly hunkering down and refusing to hire and the blame can be traced back to Washington's economic agenda. The only medicine to help is a rate cut from the Fed,"" he added, quoted by Reuters.August recorded only 22,000 new nonfarm positions, following July's revised increase of 79,000, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.Data revisions indicated June experienced a 13,000 job decrease, contrary to the previously reported 14,000 increase, marking the first decline since December 2020.These adjustments validated concerns raised by substantial downward revisions to May and June figures in July's report, leading to the dismissal of BLS Commissioner Erika McEntarfer. The president alleged data manipulation without providing evidence.Analysts attribute these revisions to the BLS ""birth-and-death"" calculation method, which estimates employment changes from business openings and closures.The president maintained his criticism of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell regarding interest rates, though avoiding direct comments on the employment figures.""Jerome 'Too Late' Powell should have lowered rates long ago. As usual, he's 'Too Late!'"" the president had posted on Truth Social.The situation reflects broader economic uncertainties, with import duties raising average tariff rates to levels unseen since 1934, whilst recent court rulings questioning their legality have created additional business uncertainty.Notably, August’s initial payroll numbers may be revised higher, as seasonal factors often cause a weak bias in the first estimate. Nonetheless, employment growth has slowed considerably, averaging 29,000 jobs per month over the last three months, compared with 82,000 in the same period in 2024. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) is expected to publish preliminary revisions to employment levels for the 12 months through March, which could reinforce the trend of slower job growth.Based on the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW) data, economists estimate employment could be revised down by as much as 800,000. The QCEW draws from employer reports to state unemployment insurance programs.Healthcare added the most jobs in August, with payrolls rising by 31,000, though this was below the 12-month average of 42,000. Social assistance jobs grew by 16,000, while federal government payrolls fell by 15,000, bringing total federal employment down 97,000 since January amid spending cuts. More declines are expected in October when employees on severance pay drop off the rolls.Manufacturing lost jobs for the fourth consecutive month, highlighting the impact of tariffs. Other sectors—including wholesale trade, information, financial activities, construction, and professional and business services—also shed positions.Wages remain a bright spot, supporting economic expansion for now. Average hourly earnings rose 0.3% in August, matching July, while annual wage growth slowed slightly to 3.7% from 3.9%. However, declining hours worked raise concerns about overall economic growth.“Today’s news probably raises more questions about the growth outlook than about the Fed outlook,” said Michael Feroli, chief economist at J.P. Morgan. “Private hours worked appear to be contracting at about a 0.5% annual rate this quarter. We remain cautious about growth prospects next quarter.”Financial markets are pricing in a quarter-percentage-point rate cut at the Fed’s September 16-17 meeting, with two more expected before the end of 2025. The central bank has maintained its benchmark overnight interest rate at 4.25%-4.50% since December. Stocks traded lower on Wall Street, the dollar weakened against a basket of currencies, and U.S. Treasury yields fell.The unemployment rate edged up from 4.2% in July to 4.3%, the highest since October 2021. The household survey indicated 436,000 people entered the labor force, but only 288,000 found employment. Economists noted that the termination of temporary legal status for hundreds of thousands of immigrants and longer bouts of unemployment contributed to weaker labor force outcomes.The average duration of joblessness increased to 24.5 weeks, the longest since April 2022. “The labor market has hit stall speed,” said Nicole Cervi, economist at Wells Fargo, highlighting the slowdown and persistent challenges in job growth.","Unemployment climbs to 4.3%, marking a nearly four-year peak.

President Trump has identified three candidates as frontrunners to replace Jerome Powell as Federal Reserve chair: his advisor Kevin Hassett, former Fed governor Kevin Warsh, and sitting Fed governor Christopher Waller.At the White House, Trump told reporters that Scott Bessent was initially considered, but the Treasury secretary declined interest. “I had four,” Trump said. “Now I'm talking about three. He (Bessent) told me: 'I'm not leaving.'”currently serves as Director of the National Economic Council in the United States. He was previously the 29th Chairman of the President’s Council of Economic Advisers from 2017 to 2019 and was later recalled to the White House as a Senior Advisor to President Trump to guide data-driven decisions in response to the Coronavirus.was sworn in as a member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System on February 24, 2006, and served until March 31, 2011. Born in Albany, New York, Warsh earned a bachelor’s degree with honors in public policy, focusing on economics and statistics, from Stanford University in 1992. He then attended Harvard Law School, where he studied the intersection of law, economics, and regulatory policy, receiving his law degree in 1995.took office as a member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System on December 18, 2020, filling an unexpired term ending January 31, 2030. Before joining the Board, Dr Waller was executive vice president and director of research at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis from 2009. He also served as a professor and held the Gilbert F. Schaefer Chair of Economics at the University of Notre Dame.Trump is reportedly seeking a Fed chairman who will support his agenda for faster interest rate reductions, according to Reuters. He has repeatedly criticised Powell for delaying action on borrowing costs, which he says has contributed to higher mortgage rates for homebuyers.Powell’s Federal Reserve has maintained steady rates throughout the year—initially due to concerns that Trump’s tariffs could fuel inflation, and more recently in response to a weakening employment market.Kevin Warsh has long advocated for fundamental changes in Federal Reserve leadership, while Waller, who led research at the St. Louis Fed before being appointed Fed governor in 2020 by Trump, is considered a conventional choice.Bessent, on Friday, launched a comprehensive critique of the Federal Reserve, calling for a thorough review of its personnel, research functions, and monetary policy decisions.","President Trump has identified three candidates as frontrunners to replace Jerome Powell as Federal Reserve chair.

'Unfair, Unjustified, Unreasonable': India Slams Trump’s 25% Additional Tariff Over Russian Oil





US President Donald Trump lashed out at the European Union on Friday for imposing a $3.5 billion antitrust fine on Google, calling it “unfair” and warning of retaliatory action if the bloc does not withdraw the penalty.“Europe today 'hit' another great American company, Google, with a $3.5 Billion Dollar fine, effectively taking money that would otherwise go to American Investments and Jobs,” Trump said in a post on Truth Social.“Very unfair, and the American taxpayer will not stand for it! As I have said before, my Administration will NOT allow these discriminatory actions to stand.”Trump added, “We cannot let this happen to brilliant and unprecedented American Ingenuity and, if it does, I will be forced to start a Section 301 proceeding to nullify the unfair penalties being charged to these Taxpaying American Companies.”His remarks came a day after he hosted Google chief executive Sundar Pichai and co-founder Sergey Brin at the White House, where he praised them for a US court decision rejecting the government’s attempt to force the sale of Google’s Chrome browser in a separate antitrust case.The European Commission had fined Google 2.95 billion euros ($3.5 billion) on Friday, ruling that the company abused its dominant position by favoring its own digital advertising services.Regulators also ordered the company to end “self-preferencing practices” and resolve “conflicts of interest” across the ad-tech supply chain.Google rejected the decision, saying it would appeal. “It imposes an unjustified fine and requires changes that will hurt thousands of European businesses by making it harder for them to make money,” said Lee-Anne Mulholland, the company’s global head of regulatory affairs.“There’s nothing anticompetitive in providing services for ad buyers and sellers, and there are more alternatives to our services than ever before,” she added.The EU ruling follows a three-year investigation launched in 2021. While regulators had raised the possibility of forcing a breakup of Google’s ad business, they stopped short of taking that step.The company also faces ongoing scrutiny in the United States, where the Justice Department has sought the divestment of its AdX and DFP platforms.","US President Donald Trump lashed out at the European Union on Friday for imposing a $3.5 billion antitrust fine on Google.

"Elon Musk package: Tesla board files $1 trillion Musk pay plan if 12 goals met; targets include robotaxis, AI bots",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/elon-musk-package-tesla-board-files-1-trillion-musk-pay-plan-if-12-goals-met-targets-include-robotaxis-ai-bots/articleshow/123720440.cms,"



Tesla CEO Elon Musk could be in line for a payout worth as much as $1 trillion if the electric carmaker meets a series of highly ambitious targets over the next decade, according to a regulatory filing released on Friday, the news agency AP reported.The proposed package includes a dozen share tranches linked to goals ranging from vehicle deliveries to market valuation. Tesla would need to hit a $2 trillion market cap, deliver 20 million cars, deploy one million robotaxis, and roll out one million AI-powered bots early in the plan. Musk must stay with the company for at least seven and a half years to cash out on any stock, and 10 years to receive the full amount.The filing also noted that the 11th and 12th tranches require Musk to present a framework for succession planning. The EV maker’s annual shareholders’ meeting is scheduled for November 6. At its last meeting in June 2024, investors restored Musk’s earlier $44.9 billion pay package that had been struck down by a Delaware court.The targets come as Tesla battles declining sales, intensifying competition from Detroit rivals and China’s BYD, and a sharp erosion in its European market share. The European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association reported Tesla sales in the EU plunged 40% year-on-year in July, dropping its market share to 0.7% while BYD rose to 1.1%.Tesla’s financials have also faltered. Quarterly profit fell to $409 million from $1.39 billion a year earlier, with revenue missing Wall Street’s lowered forecasts. Investors have expressed concern about Musk’s focus, with the billionaire spending much of this year in Washington as a prominent figure in President Donald Trump’s administration.Despite the turbulence, Tesla said the package was designed to “retain and incentivize Elon” and align his performance with shareholder value. Last month, Tesla awarded Musk a $29 billion stock grant as a “first step” in retaining him, even as a Delaware judge revoked his 2018 pay deal for a second time. Tesla has appealed the ruling.Tesla shares rose nearly 2% in premarket trading on Friday following the filing.","Tesla CEO Elon Musk could be in line for a payout worth as much as $1 trillion if the electric carmaker meets a series of highly ambitious targets over the next decade.

Japan Dumps Trump Before Modi Visit? Tokyo Walks Away From $550 Billion U.S. Trade Deal | Details





US President Donald Trump on Thursday signed an executive order implementing tariff cuts under an agreement with Japan announced in July, lowering duties on Japanese automobile imports and formalising a $550 billion investment pledge.According to news agency Reuters, the order reduces the tariff on Japanese autos from 27.5% to 15%, with the change taking effect within seven days of its publication in the Federal Register.The modifications will also apply retroactively to goods shipped from August 7, the date higher duties on dozens of economies took effect, as per news agency AFP.Other imports from Japan that previously faced tariffs above 15% will not be subject to an additional levy, while goods below that rate will be adjusted to 15%.Japan’s top negotiator Ryosei Akazawa welcomed the move, telling reporters in Washington that the step was a “steady implementation of the agreement reached on July 22.” Akazawa’s trip marked his 10th round of talks with US officials. “Finally,” he posted on X, signalling relief after months of negotiations.But he also cautioned that the 15% tariff would “still cause damage to our nation’s industries,” adding that Tokyo would take “swift and necessary measures, like financing assistance” to support affected sectors, as per AFP.According to Japan Today, the order also granted Japan “reciprocal” treatment on duties, correcting an earlier omission when similar provisions were extended to the EU.A memorandum of understanding was signed between Akazawa and US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick, covering Japan’s planned “strategic investments” in the United States. “This is historic,” Lutnick said at the signing.The deal commits Japan to invest $550 billion in US projects through equity, loans, and guarantees from state-backed banks, with Washington retaining authority to select projects.Trump has said the United States will keep 90 percent of the profits from these investments, which Japan clarified will largely consist of loans and loan guarantees.Investments will target critical sectors such as minerals, semiconductors, and pharmaceuticals.Trump said the inflows would “generate hundreds of thousands of US jobs, expand domestic manufacturing, and secure American prosperity for generations.”As part of the arrangement, Japan has agreed to increase its annual purchases of US agricultural goods, including corn, soybeans, and fertiliser, to $8 billion, along with a 75% rise in rice imports.The agreement also includes Japan buying 100 Boeing planes and lifting defence spending with US firms to $17 billion annually, up from $14 billion, Reuters noted.Toyota, which last month estimated a $10 billion hit from earlier US tariffs, praised the order for providing “much needed clarity.”While shares of Japanese automakers rose slightly on Friday, South Korean carmakers remained under pressure as Seoul awaits a similar executive order from Washington.The deal comes at a sensitive moment for Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, whose leadership faces a test with his ruling party set to vote on a possible extraordinary election.Analysts cited by Reuters said that while finalising the trade pact could strengthen Ishiba’s position, he still faces internal backlash over rising living costs and weak economic growth.","US President Donald Trump on Thursday signed an executive order implementing tariff cuts under an agreement with Japan announced in July.

US President Donald Trump on Thursday announced that United States will impose a ""fairly substantial tariff"" on computer chips coming into the country, during a White House dinner with tech industry executives.""We will be putting a tariff very shortly,"" Trump said at the White House, adding, ""Not that high, but fairly substantial tariff.""However, the US president didn't provide details or a timetable for the new levy. He has repeatedly threatened in the past to impose tariffs on chips.Earlier in August, Trump said that he will announce a 100% tariff on semiconductors from firms that do not invest in the US.

Boost for US agriculture and manufacturing









President Donald Trump on Thursday (US local time) signed an executive order formally implementing the US-Japan trade agreement, a landmark pact that lowers tariffs on Japanese autos to 15% and secures a $550 billion investment pledge from Tokyo, the White House announced.The White House confirmed the move in a statement posted on X.Under the agreement, nearly all Japanese imports entering the United States will face a baseline tariff of 15%. For automobiles, the rate drops from 27.5 % to 15% — a significant victory for Japanese automakers.In a statement, the White House emphasised Tokyo’s unprecedented investment pledge: “Critically, unlike any other agreement in American history, the Government of Japan has agreed to invest $550 billion in the United States.”The projects will be selected by US officials and are expected to create thousands of jobs, strengthen domestic manufacturing, and boost infrastructure.

The US trade gap widened sharply in July, hitting its largest level in four months, as businesses rushed in imports ahead of fresh tariffs from US President Donald Trump.Figures from the department of commerce on Thursday showed the deficit rose by 32.5% to $78.3 billion. Imports jumped 5.9% to $358.8 billion, while exports increased only slightly, up 0.3% to $280.5 billion.""While imports bounced back in July, more than half of the increase was due to gold as trade policy and safe-haven demand brought about a resurgence in trade,"" said Matthew Martin, senior economist at Oxford Economics told AFP.""Excluding gold, imports rose by a more modest 3.3%, while exports fell 0.1%,"" Martin added.Pantheon Macroeconomics analysts described the widening shortfall as the result of ""another wave of pre-tariff stockpiling.""Trump initially introduced a 10% tariff on most trading partners in April. Plans to raise these levies were postponed twice before taking effect in early August, affecting key allies such as the European Union, Japan and India.Economists believe businesses that front-loaded imports are now running low on existing stocks, meaning they will soon face higher costs when they place new orders.For now, however, the broader impact on inflation in the US remains limited.A Briefing.com poll of forecasters had expected the deficit to come in much smaller, at $64.2 billion.Martin noted that strong demand for capital goods linked to artificial intelligence and data centres had also pushed up imports. The Commerce Department added that inflows of industrial supplies and consumer goods both rose strongly.Trade with China played a significant role, with the US goods deficit widening by $5.3 billion to $14.7 billion in July.""Unsurprisingly, given the level of tariffs, China has been the hardest hit of all trading partners,"" Martin said. Goods from the world’s second-largest economy are now subject to an additional 30% tariff this year, while other Asian nations face lower rates.Trump’s tariff strategy has rattled global supply chains, with import surges recorded as early as March, before his wide-ranging duties began in April.

The number of Americans applying for unemployment benefits increased slightly last week, reflecting that employers are retaining workers despite the economy showing signs of slowing down.According to the figures released by the US labour department on Thursday, for the week ending 30 August, jobless claims rose by 8,000 to 237,000. The rise was higher than the 231,000 applications economists had predicted.Unemployment benefit claims are often seen as an indicator of layoffs, and they have mostly stayed within a healthy range of 200,000 to 250,000 since the US emerged from the pandemic almost four years ago.Despite layoffs remaining relatively low, hiring has weakened, with economists calling it a “no hire, no fire” economy. The jobless rate remains low at 4.2%.New government data earlier this week showed employers had 7.2 million job vacancies at the end of July, fewer than expected and another sign of labour market weakness.Last month’s disappointing July jobs report, which recorded only 73,000 new positions and revised previous months sharply down, unsettled financial markets.In its wake, US President Donald Trump dismissed the head of the agency responsible for compiling the monthly figures.Attention is now turning to the August employment report, due on Friday. Economists expect employers to have added around 80,000 private non-farm jobs. Wall Street and the Federal Reserve are watching closely, as recent figures suggest hiring has slowed dramatically since spring.Over the past three months, job creation has averaged just 35,000 a month, about a quarter of last year’s pace. Businesses have been pulling back on expansion plans amid uncertainty over Trump’s tariff policies, contributing to a broader slowdown.The economy expanded at an annual rate of 1.3% in the first half of 2025, compared with 2.5% last year.Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell has already indicated that interest rates could be cut at the central bank’s next meeting on 16–17 September to ease borrowing costs on mortgages, car finance and business loans.Thursday’s report also showed the four-week moving average of claims rose by 2,500 to 231,000. The total number of people receiving unemployment benefits for the week ending 23 August slipped by 4,000 to 1.94 million.","Jobless claims rose by 8,000 to 237,000 in the week ending 30 August.

Wall Street traded in green on Thursday as pressure from the bond market eased and investors closely watched signs of weakness in the US labour market.The S&P 500 gained 0.17% or 10 points to reach 6,459. Dow Jones Industrial Average began the day in red but jumped 54 points or 0.12%, trading at 45,325 at 7.55 PM IST. Nasdaq followed the suit, jumping to 21,524, rising 0.13% or 27 points.Treasury yields eased following discouraging signals on jobs, with reports pointing to weaker hiring among private employers last month and a potential rise in layoffs last week.Neither report signalled towards a recession, but a cooling jobs market could prompt the Federal Reserve to cut its main interest rate for the first time this year in the coming weeks. A more comprehensive employment report is due on Friday.Shares of American Eagle Outfitters surged 26% after the teen fashion retailer posted more than double Wall Street’s expected second-quarter profit late Wednesday. The company benefitted from intense media attention in late July over its deliberately provocative campaign featuring 27-year-old actor Sydney Sweeney.Google gave back a fraction of Wednesday’s 9.1% rally, slipping less than 1% before the bell.The tech giant had jumped after avoiding some of the worst-case scenarios in its antitrust trial.Later Thursday, the government is set to release its latest weekly layoffs data, paving the way for the crucial August jobs report on Friday. On Wednesday, official figures showed that US employers had 7.2 million job openings at the end of July, fewer than economists expected, marking another sign of a weakening labour market.The deteriorating outlook has bolstered expectations that the Fed will lower rates at its meeting later this month. Last month’s July jobs report, which included sharp downward revisions for June and May, rattled markets and led President Donald Trump to sack the head of the agency responsible for compiling the figures.Lower interest rates could help shore up both the labour market and the wider economy, but the risk remains that easing policy could stoke inflation at a time when Trump’s tariffs may already be pushing up the cost of imports.In Europe, Germany’s DAX climbed 0.8% by midday, while London’s FTSE 100 edged up 0.2% and the CAC 40 in Paris slipped 0.1%.Asian markets were largely positive.

Putin Lashes Out At German Chancellor After ‘War Criminal’ Jibe Amid Ukraine Truce Delay





Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday dismissed the Ukraine conflict as a mere “pretext” used by Western powers to impose broader punitive measures against countries engaged in strong economic relations with Moscow.Speaking to the media after concluding a four-day visit to China, Putin argued that recent trade restrictions and tariffs were being justified under the Ukraine narrative but, in reality, pursued unrelated political and economic agendas.“The Ukraine situation is only a pretext to take various steps against countries that have economic ties with us,” he said, according to ANI.He pointed to tariffs imposed on Brazil earlier in August as an example of trade penalties that had no direct link to the Ukraine conflict. Putin said the actual reasons behind these measures were economic imbalances between the West, particularly the United States and major economies like India, China and Brazil.“There is a trade disproportion between the United States and India or with China, but there is no situation between Brazil and the United States, for example. And, by the way, Brazil faced additional tariffs on the 6th of August, even though the deadline was the 8th of August.So what does Ukraine have to do with this? Nothing. It's only about domestic politics... Ukraine doesn't have anything to do with that. So, of course, there is some imbalance in trade, but I believe that those should be addressed through negotiations,"" the Putin added.The Russian President’s remarks come at a time when Washington’s tariff policies have heightened global trade tensions. India, in particular, faces uncertainty after the US imposed a 50 per cent tariff on imports, alongside an additional 25 per cent linked to its purchase of Russian crude oil.Washington has argued that India’s crude imports indirectly support Moscow’s war effort.In the same press briefing, Putin also said he remained open to meeting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, provided such a meeting was well-prepared and aimed at achieving a constructive outcome. “If Zelenskyy is ready, he can come to Moscow. This is quite possible,” he said, while reiterating Moscow’s opposition to Ukraine’s Nato membership but showing less resistance to its European Union ambitions.Meanwhile, frustration has been rising in Europe over Moscow’s stance. As per news agency AFP, European leaders are gathering in Paris with Ukrainian President Zelenskyy to push for stronger security guarantees for Kyiv, warning that Russia remains unwilling to strike a peace deal.French President Emmanuel Macron said allies were ready to offer guarantees “the day that a peace accord is signed,” while Ukraine’s foreign minister dismissed Putin’s Moscow invitation as “knowingly unacceptable.”","Vladimir Putin dismisses Ukraine conflict as a mere “pretext” used by Western powers to impose punitive measures against countries engaged in strong economic relations with Moscow.

Asian stocks gained on Thursday as dovish signals from US Federal Reserve officials and weak labour market data reinforced bets on interest rate cuts, even as oil prices extended losses ahead of a key Opec+ meeting.MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.5% after US equities closed with modest gains, Reuters reported.Japan’s Nikkei 225 opened 1.2% higher, while Australian shares advanced 0.7% following their steepest one-day drop since April. South Korean stocks also gained, though Chinese equities bucked the trend, with the Shanghai Composite down 0.4% on reports that regulators are preparing cooling measures for markets.Federal Reserve governor Christopher Waller said the central bank should begin lowering rates in September, with “multiple cuts in coming months,” according to Bloomberg. Traders are nearly fully pricing in a September reduction, CME FedWatch data showed, following a drop in US job openings to a 10-month low.Analysts at Capital.com noted the labour market slowdown “boosts the case for rate cuts.”US futures edged higher, with investors encouraged by comments that reinforced expectations of easier monetary policy.“Many people are looking for this weakness in September to be a buying opportunity,” said IG analyst Tony Sycamore, as quoted by Reuters.Meanwhile, oil prices weakened further, with Brent crude slipping 27 cents, or 0.40%, to $67.33 a barrel, and US West Texas Intermediate down 28 cents, or 0.44%, to $63.69, Reuters reported.The decline extended Wednesday’s 2% drop, driven by expectations that Opec+ will raise output at its meeting on Sunday.Sources cited by Reuters said that eight Opec+ members are considering further production increases in October, adding to the 2.5 million barrels per day already planned from April to September.US crude stockpile data due later Thursday will also provide direction, after the American Petroleum Institute estimated a build of 622,000 barrels last week against analyst expectations of a 2 million-barrel draw.","MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.5%.

US market today: Wall Street steadies as Alphabet drives tech gains; bond yields retreat as weak job openings add pressure,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-stock-market-today-wall-street-nasdaq-dow-jones-sp-500-alphabet-stock-macy/articleshow/123679779.cms,"



Wall Street steadied on Wednesday as a rebound in technology stocks, led by Alphabet, helped offset declines in the Dow, while fresh signs of weakness in the US job market bolstered hopes of an interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve.The S&P 500 gained 0.3% by midday, putting it on track to snap a two-day losing streak after recently setting an all-time high. The Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.9%, lifted by strong gains in big tech stocks, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 179 points, or 0.4%, AP reported.Google’s parent company Alphabet surged 8.7% after a federal judge ordered changes to its search engine business but stopped short of forcing a breakup of its Chrome browser. “This is a relief, an outcome that is much better than feared for Google and for Apple,” said Chris Marangi, co-chief investment officer of value at Gabelli Funds. Apple rose 3% after analysts said it stood to continue benefiting from lucrative search deals with Google.Bond yields, which rattled markets a day earlier, retreated following weaker-than-expected labour data. The 10-year Treasury yield eased to 4.21% from 4.28% late Tuesday.The latest government report showed employers advertised 7.2 million job openings at the end of July, below forecasts, reinforcing expectations that the labour market is cooling.A softer jobs environment has strengthened the view that the Fed may cut interest rates at its policy meeting later this month. Traders widely expect the central bank to deliver its first rate cut of the year, though concerns linger that President Donald Trump’s tariffs on imports could add fresh inflationary pressures.Among individual movers, Macy’s jumped 17.1% after reporting stronger quarterly profit and revenue than analysts expected, its best sales growth in three years. The retailer also raised its full-year guidance. American Bitcoin, a mining and treasury firm linked to the Trump family, surged 28.1% in its Nasdaq debut after merging with Gryphon Digital Mining, with trading so volatile it was halted several times.Campbell Soup rose 4.9% on stronger-than-expected earnings but warned tariffs could weigh on next year’s profits. On the downside, Dollar Tree fell 7.1% despite beating earnings forecasts, as analysts pointed to high expectations and the risk of tariff-related cost pressures.Overseas, European markets edged higher while Asian shares closed mixed, with Japan’s Nikkei 225 falling 0.9% amid uncertainty over Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba’s political future.","S&P 500 on track to snap two-day losing streak after setting all-time high.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran Udaan until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.Udaan built an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business still accounts for a very small part of India’s overall retail market but can balloon to $150 billion in sales and yield a 100% return on capital invested in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co. estimates published in the Mint newspaper.Bengaluru-based Udaan has also ventured into financing through its fintech unit which helps shopkeepers get working capital loans to buy inventory. That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says.

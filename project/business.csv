China Sides With Iran, Greenlights Hormuz BLOCKADE? Beijing's First Response As U.S. Seeks Help

Operation Midnight Thunder

What will happen to Trump's tariffs ? 4 scenarios to consider

‘The World Chickens Out’: The first possibility involves other nations interpreting Trump's actions as a serious warning sign, whilst viewing the strikes as an isolated incident that temporarily halts the Middle East tensions. This prompts countries to offer substantial compromises to Washington, hastening to finalise trade agreements before Trump's Liberation Day tariffs deadline of July 9. This represents the White House's likely preferred outcome: ""The World Chickens Out"", according to Bloomberg. ‘Trump Chickens Out Rationally’: The subsequent scenario suggests that the weekend military action intensifies the ongoing conflict, triggering elevated oil prices, worldwide economic disruption and volatile financial markets throughout summer. Trump responds by postponing his tariff implementation. However, the economic consequences remain significant, whilst continued trade uncertainty creates additional challenges. This represents: ""Trump Chickens Out Rationally"". ‘Trump Holds Hands With the World’: The third possibility envisions an unexpected global unity, including the US, to counter economic repercussions. A unified approach to stabilise oil prices and financial markets, coupled with renewed international cooperation, results in minimal global economic disruption. This could be termed: ""Trump Holds Hands With the World."" ‘No One Chickens Out’: The fourth and most concerning scenario suggests Trump, encouraged by his initial actions, pursues an aggressive strategy. Iran responds by blocking Gulf oil shipments. Despite soaring oil prices and market downturns, Trump intensifies his tariff policies. As the Liberation Day duties suspension ends, American trade barriers reach levels unseen since the 1800s. Major economies implement countermeasures, leading to worldwide trade disruption. Both global and US economies enter recession. Trump maintains his stance as international tensions escalate, potentially leading towards widespread conflict. This scenario could be labelled: ""No One Chickens Out.""

Alternative outcomes or combinations of these scenarios might prove more realistic.

US strikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities have had one important consequence - globally markets are aware that Donald Trump will not always ‘chicken out’! US President Donald Trump's military strike on Iranian nuclear installations, alongside Israel's ongoing conflict with Iran, has introduced additional geopolitical uncertainties into an already unstable global economic landscape.In this backdrop, Trump’s decisions on tariffs have become more crucial than ever. Prior to the weekend attacks, financial markets and America’s trading partner were possibly operating under the principle that ""Trump Always Chickens Out, or TACO"". This notion suggested that each severe threat, including that of high reciprocal tariffs, would ultimately be watered downTrump's implementation of tariffs risks elevating prices and hampering economic growth. However, the prevalent belief suggested these effects would manifest as mild economic discomfort rather than severe financial distress.The widespread acceptance of ""TACO"" has encouraged market optimism, despite economists' warnings about the impending effects of Trump's tariffs on domestic and international economies.Also Read | Nightmare scenario: How Iran, hit by US & Israel strikes, may choke world’s oil supply via Strait of Hormuz - explained This belief has also strengthened the resolve of nations in negotiations with the president, who has openly expressed his eagerness for agreements and established a July 9 deadline through a 90-day postponement of his most severe tariff measures. Some countries have questioned the necessity of yielding to Trump’s demands when retreat appears inevitable. But, that may change now!The US president's decision to strike Iran, contrary to advice from his closest allies, demonstrates his unpredictable leadership style.His willingness to take action where previous administrations hesitated shows a departure from conventional diplomatic approaches.According to a Bloomberg report, the global economic impact of ""Operation Midnight Thunder"" hinges on Iran's response. Should tensions escalate, leading to Iran blocking the Strait of Hormuz and causing oil prices to rise, it would create additional strain on an already vulnerable global economy weakened by existing trade tariffs.The situation might prompt international markets and policymakers to reassess their interpretation of Trump's warnings. This military action proves his readiness to follow through on serious threats when diplomatic negotiations fail to achieve his desired outcomes, the report said.It's important to note that whilst economic conflicts typically cause less devastation than military ones, every conflict impacts the economy. This situation will likely follow the same pattern.Also Read | Iran-Israel war & US bombings: Should possible Strait of Hormuz closure worry India about its oil supply?

Gold price prediction today: Gold is in focus with heightened geopolitical tensions between Iran and Israel and with the US bombing nuclear facilities in Iran. Will gold prices resume a conclusive upward trend amidst growing global uncertainties?Gold prices remained volatile throughout last week, hovering around the ₹1 lakh mark domestically, as geopolitical tensions between Israel and Iran escalated, boosting safe-haven demand.Despite this, gold’s upward momentum was capped by a firm dollar, which was hovering slightly below 100. Investors are closely monitoring the US Federal Reserve’s policy stance after it left interest rates unchanged while signalling a more gradual rate cut path ahead. Fed Chair Jerome Powell emphasized caution, citing stable unemployment and expectations of rising inflation due to tariffs. Markets are pricing in rate cuts totalling 50 bps in 2025, but less aggressive easing for 2026–27.Meanwhile, US data revealed weaker-than-expected retail sales and industrial production, indicating potential economic softness, though jobless claims were lower, suggesting resilience in the labor market. Market participants now await Powell’s upcoming testimony and key economic indicators including preliminary PMIs, GDP, consumer confidence, and the PCE price index.In global developments, China’s central bank held steady on its loan prime rates, adding pressure to industrial metals. Domestically, silver saw some profit booking from all-time highs. Despite tensions and US intervention in the Iran-Israel conflict, Iran' s stance on Strait of Hormus is very important for further direction in the market.","Gold prices remained volatile throughout last week, hovering around the ₹1 lakh mark domestically.

UN stint taught me how to question status quo: RBI governor Sanjay Malhotra,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/un-stint-taught-me-how-to-question-status-quo-rbi-governor-sanjay-malhotra/articleshow/122034559.cms,"LUCKNOW: RBI governor Sanjay Malhotra on Monday said his experience at the United Nations taught him to challenge status quo, a lesson that helped him streamline government systems during his administrative career.Speaking at the 58th convocation of IIT Kanpur, Malhotra-an alumnus of the institute - outlined four key learnings from his professional journey thus far: continuous learning, questioning status quo, pursuing one's karma without fear, and building trust.Quoting Albert Einstein, Malhotra asked students to never stop questioning. ""When you question status quo and ask questions, you open the door to new ideas and fresh perspectives. It is fuel for innovation; it drives you to explore, experiment, and create something better. So, no matter where you are in life or your career, never stop questioning status quo and improving,""he said.Between 2003 and 2006, while working at UN on a project to improve productivity in India's hand tool manufacturing clusters, Malhotra saw how small interventions could trigger systemic change.A total quality management expert involved in the initiative had asked forging units to reduce the time taken to change a die from eight hours to less than one. The suggestion was met with scepticism. Eventually, the introduction of a simple video recording of the process helped identify inefficiencies - late starts, unplanned breaks, and lack of preparation. Malhotra said he carried this mindset into his roles in taxation, power, banking, and finance. ""It helped in making changes in laws, rules, and procedures, for the benefit of citizens and the government alike.""","RBI governor Sanjay Malhotra spoke at the 58th convocation of IIT Kanpur.

It also outlines social exemptions for essential expenses such as education, housing, healthcare, zakat, and donations, ensuring fairness and shielding low- and middle-income earners from additional financial burden.

According to the nation’s tax authority, the exemption threshold has been deliberately kept high to ensure that about 99 per cent of Oman's population remains unaffected by the tax.

The primary objective of the new personal income tax is to increase the contribution of non-oil revenues to Oman’s GDP, which the government aims to raise to 18 per cent by 2040.

To facilitate implementation, Oman is building a modern electronic tax system that will link government databases for accurate income reporting and improved compliance. The executive regulations for the new law will be issued within a year of its publication in the Official Gazette.

Other goals include improving fiscal stability, supporting public welfare programs, and enhancing the country’s credit ratings.

In 2024, Oman collected OMR 1.4 billion in corporate, VAT, and selective taxes. The addition of personal income tax is expected to strengthen the nation’s fiscal position and enhance its appeal to global investors.

Oman announced the introduction of personal income tax, targeting high-income individuals, as part of a broader fiscal reform initiative under its Vision 2040 strategy.The new tax, first in the history of Oman, will take effect from January 1, 2028, and impose a 5 per cent levy on individuals earning more than OMR 42,000 per year.The measure was formally issued under Royal Decree No. 56/2025 by Sultan Haitham bin Tarik and marks a significant step towards economic diversification.Karima Mubarak Al Saadi, director of the personal income tax project, said that infrastructure, training, and legal frameworks are already in place, reported ANI. She added that awareness and educational guides for individuals and businesses will be rolled out in stages ahead of the law’s implementation.This move also reflects a broader regional shift in the Gulf, where countries are seeking to build more sustainable and resilient economies by reducing dependence on oil income.","Oman to introduce first income tax for high earners from 2028.

"Hang seng slides as US-Iran conflict weighs on Asian markets; brent crude spikes 5%, OPEC warns of supply risk",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/hang-seng-slides-as-us-iran-conflict-weighs-on-asian-markets-brent-crude-spikes-5-opec-warns-of-supply-risk/articleshow/122015203.cms,"(Image credits: ANI)

Brent Crude prices spiked as much as 5% on Monday following the US airstrikes on Iran’s key nuclear facilities on Sunday. The move ended days of speculation over whether the US President Donald Trump would join Israel in its confrontation with Iran.While prices surged initially, they soon pared gains. The attacks on Fordow, Natanz and Isfahan had led to expectations of a sustained oil rally. Iran is the third-largest producer in the OPEC+ bloc and accounts for around a third of global oil output.Last week, Brent Crude futures rose 11%, touching $80 per barrel before retreating. Prices rebounded again as Trump kept markets guessing on the US’s involvement, but hopes of a ceasefire and ample supply from OPEC+ capped further gains.Analysts noted that demand remains weak, giving little reason for oil to hold elevated levels.OPEC+ is scheduled to meet on July 5 to discuss another output hike for August, after already increasing supplies by 4.11 million barrels per day in June and July.Saul Kavonic, an energy analyst at MST Marquee, said, “Much depends on how Iran responds in the coming hours and days, but this could set us on a path toward $100 oil, if Iran responds as they have previously threatened to,”Iran claims it reserves the right to respond to the US attacks.Local media reports its parliament has approved the closure of the Strait of Hormuz, though the final call rests with its National Security Council. The US has urged China to discourage Iran from taking that step.T he Strait of Hormuz is a critical oil chokepoint, more than 20 million barrels per day, or 20% of the world’s oil supply, passed through it last year, according to the US Energy Information Administration.Goldman Sachs has warned that a closure of the strait could push oil prices above $100 per barrel. However, JPMorgan views the possibility as low, saying such a move could be seen by the US as an ""act of war.""Rising crude prices could hurt India’s economy, particularly oil marketing companies like HPCL, BPCL, and Indian Oil, along with industries like aviation, paints, and tyres that rely heavily on oil.Goldman Sachs’ Santanu Sengupta told CNBC-TV18 that a rise in crude to $75 per barrel would hurt India’s macroeconomic stability. A $10-per-barrel increase could raise the cost burden by 30–40 basis points.Samiran Chakraborty, chief India economist at Citi, also noted that supply chain disruptions could raise inflation risks, but said India may still be able to manage slightly higher prices due to its limited exposure to Iranian oil.US officials said no further strikes are planned for now, but warned that any retaliation from Iran would invite an even more forceful response.“This is the big one,” said John Kilduff of Again Capital, pointing to a possible $8-a-barrel risk premium. “The market default on this development is higher. How high depends on Iran’s response, or the realistic prospects of a meaningful response, which may not be there.”","Brent Crude prices spiked as much as 5% on Monday following the US airstrikes on Iran’s key nuclear facilities on Sunday.

Piyush Goyal Says India Will Be $32 Trillion Economy By 2047, Sends Message To UK And Opposition

Frederick W Smith, the visionary founder and former CEO of FedEx Corp, passed away on Saturday at the age of 80, confirmed FedEx.Smith, who transformed the logistics industry with the concept of overnight delivery, leaves behind a legacy that reshaped global commerce and created one of the world’s most recognisable brands.“It is with profound sadness and a heavy heart that I share that Frederick W Smith, our founder and executive chairman, died earlier today,” wrote FedEx President and CEO Raj Subramaniam in a message to employees. “Fred was more than just the pioneer of an industry… he was the heart and soul of FedEx – its PSP culture, values, integrity, and spirit.”Smith's journey from a college student with an unconventional idea to the architect of a global shipping empire is legendary. As reported by the Commercial Appeal, the concept behind FedEx was born from a 1965 term paper he wrote at Yale University, proposing a system for time-sensitive deliveries—a vision few believed in at the time. “The overwhelming body of opinion said it wouldn’t work, or that we couldn’t raise the money,” Smith once recalled.FedEx officially began operations in 1973, and despite early financial and regulatory challenges, the company revolutionised air cargo delivery, offering businesses rapid shipment of urgent goods like electronics and machine parts.Before FedEx, such deliveries were largely dependent on passenger flights, lacking the efficiency Smith envisioned.Smith led FedEx for decades, helping grow it into a multibillion-dollar enterprise employing hundreds of thousands worldwide. Along the way, he forged relationships with major political figures, including George W Bush and John McCain, advocating for open trade and deregulation, key to FedEx’s business model.Born on August 11, 1944, in Marks, Mississippi, Smith faced adversity early in life. Raised in Memphis after his father's death, he overcame a childhood hip disorder to become an athlete in high school. He showed early promise as both a pilot and entrepreneur, co-founding a record label at age 15 and later mastering both aviation and economics at Yale.Jim Barksdale, former FedEx COO and later CEO of Netscape, once said, “He is the most impressive executive I have ever met.”Smith’s death marks the end of an era for FedEx and the logistics industry at large. As Subramaniam noted, “In the coming days and weeks, I know we will all find ways to honor his memory and pay tribute to his legacy.”","Frederick W Smith, the visionary founder and former CEO of FedEx Corp, passed away on Saturday at the age of 80.

It is a centre of gravity for countries seeking mutual respect and non-interference,” said Alipov, rejecting suggestions that the group was being shaped as an anti-West coalition, reported PTI. He noted that trade in national currencies was already underway between BRICS members.India’s BRICS Sherpa and Secretary (Economic Relations) in the Ministry of External Affairs, Dammu Ravi, said discussions around a BRICS common currency are “at a very early stage.”“Today, for now, we are only looking at trade settlement in national currencies. Harmonisation of fiscal and monetary policies is very, very difficult to achieve,” he said.Brazilian Ambassador Kenneth da Nobrega echoed the sentiment, adding that while deeper integration like a common currency requires years of policy alignment, local currency trade was already showing results. “It’s a long way. But trading in local currencies? That’s already working,” Nobrega said.The summit comes amid geopolitical unease following warnings by President Donald Trump against any formal move by BRICS nations to undermine the US dollar’s dominance in global trade. The Trump administration’s tariffs have already drawn concern among developing economies.The summit is set to be attended by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Chinese President Xi Jinping, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, and leaders of newly inducted members such as Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, UAE, and Indonesia.Ambassador Ina Krisnamurthi of Indonesia called for systemic reform, saying, “Our international order, the rules-based system, is crashing into the limits of its founding vision.” She said BRICS must evolve from “just dialogue to delivery,” focusing on climate finance, humanitarian relief, and data equity.“Right now, the Global South represents 85 per cent of the world’s population and 39 per cent of global GDP,” Krisnamurthi noted. “Yet multilateral institutions do not reflect this reality.”Citing a surge in the middle class across India, China and ASEAN, she said: “In 2000, only 150 million enjoyed middle-class living standards. Today, that number is 1.5 billion — double the total population of Western countries.”Egyptian envoy Kamel Galal said Cairo had always seen itself as a natural part of the bloc. “We are keen that the group should focus on areas of cooperation that enjoy consensus, rather than divisive issues,” he said, stressing a development-first agenda for Africa and the Middle East.Touching on global flashpoints like Gaza, Syria, Lebanon and Sudan, Galal called for reforming global institutions to better reflect “the evolving dynamics and rising role of developing countries.”Quoting the Egyptian Book of the Dead, he added, “What I hate is ignorance, smallness of imagination, the eye that sees no further than its own idol. All things are possible. Who you are is limited by who you think you are.”Replacing the oft-cited “conflict, crisis and challenge” narrative, Galal proposed a new vision for BRICS: “collaboration, complementarity, consensus and cohesion.”The panel concluded with a Q&A session that focused on the institutional future of BRICS, prospects of a unified currency, and the bloc’s ambitions under the UN Sustainable Development Goals framework.",Senior diplomats from leading member nations said the grouping is likely to intensify efforts toward settling trade in national currencies. They ruled out any imminent move toward a unified BRICS currency.

South Korean President Lee Jae Myung has introduced a 30.5 trillion won (USD 22.1 billion) supplementary budget plan aimed at revitalising the country’s weakening economy and supporting struggling citizens, reported news agency ANI, citing The Korea Herald.The proposal, which received Cabinet approval on Thursday, includes 20.2 trillion won in new spending and a downward revision of 10.3 trillion won in revenue projections, South Korea’s first such adjustment in five years.“Fiscal soundness and adherence to balanced budgeting are important, but the current downturn is too severe for the government to stand by,” Lee said at a Cabinet meeting, according to The Korea Herald. “It is time to put public finances to use.”President Lee emphasised two key priorities: stimulating economic growth and ensuring equitable distribution of benefits. Central to the stimulus is a universal cash handout scheme worth 10.3 trillion won, disbursed via spending coupons.All citizens will initially receive a minimum of 150,000 won, while lower-income households will get more. A second round of payments will exclude the top 10 per cent of earners, with the remaining 90 per cent receiving an additional 100,000 won.As per news agency Reuters, this marks the second supplementary budget of the year, coming just weeks after Lee's June 3 election victory. His expansionary fiscal approach aims to counter sluggish domestic demand, compounded by external shocks including US President Donald Trump's tariff hikes and internal political turmoil.The budget includes 2.7 trillion won for the beleaguered construction sector, which has seen four consecutive quarters of contraction.An additional 1.2 trillion won is earmarked for future-oriented industries, such as AI and renewable energy, while 5 trillion won is set aside for livelihood support. This includes 1.4 trillion won for distressed borrower debt relief and 1.6 trillion won to boost job-seeking aid and delayed wage support for vulnerable workers.The revenue forecast has been cut to 642.4 trillion won, down from 651.6 trillion won. Total government expenditure for 2025 has been revised upwards from 673.3 trillion won to 702 trillion won.The resulting integrated fiscal deficit is expected to widen to 110.4 trillion won, or 4.2 per cent of GDP, up from last year’s 3.3 per cent, with national debt forecast to exceed 1,300 trillion won, pushing the debt-to-GDP ratio to 49 per cent.The government plans to fund the package with 19.8 trillion won in treasury bond issuances and an additional 10 trillion won from budget restructuring and reserves.Despite the expanding deficit, the finance ministry said Korea’s fiscal stance remains sustainable by global standards. The supplementary budget is projected to boost GDP growth by 0.1 to 0.2 percentage points.The Bank of Korea currently projects 0.8 per cent growth, while the IMF expects a 1 per cent rise.","South Korean President Lee Jae Myung has introduced a 30.5 trillion won (USD 22.1 billion) supplementary budget plan.

‘Maybe I’ll change my mind about firing him’: Trump revives threat to fire Fed Chair Jerome Powell; calls him ‘total and complete moron’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/maybe-ill-change-my-mind-about-firing-him-trump-revives-threat-to-fire-fed-chair-jerome-powell-calls-him-total-and-complete-moron/articleshow/121991162.cms,"Donald Trump revives threat to fire Fed Chair Jerome Powell (Picture credit: AP)

US President Donald Trump on Friday again floated the possibility of firing Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, reigniting a long-standing feud over interest rates he claims should be much lower.In a scathing post on Truth Social, Trump called Powell a “numbskull” and a “total and complete moron,” blaming him for refusing to reduce rates despite what Trump called “virtually no inflation” in the economy.“I don’t know why the Board doesn’t override this Total and Complete Moron! Maybe, just maybe, I’ll have to change my mind about firing him?” Trump wrote. “But regardless, his Term ends shortly,” Trump added.Powell’s current term ends in May 2026.Trump’s renewed criticism came just days after the Federal Reserve decided to hold interest rates steady at 4.25%–4.50%. Powell, backed by all six board members and five regional bank presidents, cited the need for patience as inflation trends slowly downward.Trump, however, insists rates should be slashed to between 1% and 2%, claiming such a move could save the country up to $1 trillion annually.“I’ve tried it all different ways. I’ve been nice, I’ve been neutral, and I’ve been nasty, and nice and neutral didn’t work!” Trump added.As per The Hill, Powell has previously stated that a sitting US president cannot lawfully remove a Fed chair except for cause, such as misconduct. A recent Supreme Court ruling also reinforced the Fed’s unique structure as a quasi-independent entity, limiting Trump’s ability to dismiss Powell directly.Trump's renewed focus on the Fed comes at a time when Fed Governor Christopher Waller, considered a top contender for Powell’s successor, suggested that rate cuts could be on the table by July, citing cooling inflation and signs of a weakening labour market.Nonetheless, Waller joined the unanimous decision to keep rates on hold this week.Adding to the speculation, Trump is reportedly preparing to announce a nominee to replace Powell, potentially well before the end of his term.Market analysts have warned that such an early move could create instability by introducing a “shadow chair” dynamic, where the sitting chair and the president's nominee pull policy in conflicting directions.Names circulating as potential replacements include Fed Governor Waller, former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh, former Trump nominee Judy Shelton, and White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett. However, any new Fed chair must be confirmed by the US Senate, a process that could take months.Market strategists caution that the perception of a politically influenced appointment could erode confidence in the Fed’s independence. “Any Wall Street manager would tell you that Fed independence is the golden rule of markets,” said Callie Cox of Ritholtz Wealth Management.Despite the firestorm, Powell remains firm. In a previous statement, he said he would not step down if asked and reiterated that Fed decisions are grounded in economic data, not political pressure.Meanwhile, Trump's intensifying rhetoric and tariff plans continue to inject uncertainty into the central bank’s outlook for the second half of 2025.","US President Donald Trump on Friday again floated the possibility of firing Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.","Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor ( CEA ) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas.

How India's GDP has been growing

What SBI report said on savings and investment

Incremental capital output ratio

NEW DELHI: India's gross domestic product (GDP) data for the third quarter (October-December 2022) received a word of caution from the former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan In an interview with news agency PTI, Rajan that India is ""dangerously close"" to the Hindu rate of growth in view of subdued private sector investment, high interest rates and slowing global growth.India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying"".However, a report released by the State Bank of India (SBI) economists on Tuesday dismissed arguments that India is dangerously close to Hindu rate of growth saying such statements are ""ill-conceived, biased and premature"".The term 'Hindu growth rate' was coined by late economist Raj Krishna in 1978 to describe the slow growth in the country.It basically refers to the low pace of economic growth rates during 1950s to 1980s. During this period, the Indian economy averaged 3.5%.A former lecturer at the Delhi School of Economics (DSE), Krishna noted that only if the rate of growth is persistently slow and accompanied by low per-capita GDP, then it will be known as Hindu rate of growth but it has to factor in population growth as well.Before economic reforms of 1991, India's economic growth remained stagnant and low, while per capita income averaged around 1.3%. Krishna termed this low growth situation to be a result of socialist policies of state control and import substitution.However, the economic situation changed when liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation (LPG) reforms came into effect in the year 1991, at a time when India faced balance of payment crisis.Over the years, many economists have strongly opposed the idea of 'Hindu growth rate' and the term never had universal acceptance.The Indian economy plunged into its very first technical recession in FY21 due to the impact of Covid-19 pandemic and the related nationwide lockdowns. GDP shrunk by an unprecedented 23.8% in the first quarter of the financial year 2020-21. However, due to spurt in economic activities in the subsequent quarters, the GDP decline started to narrow.However, if we look at the period before Covid-19 as well, India's growth curve shows a declining trend.From 8.26% in FY17, GDP growth plunged to 3.74% in FY20. Shutdown of economic activities in FY21 in wake of Covid-19 only made matters worse.As lockdowns started to ease and business activities resumed, India's GDP also started rising. In Q1 of FY22, growth jumped to 20.1% mainly on account of low base effect. By the fourth quarter of FY22, growth came down to 4.10%.Similarly, the new financial year 2022-23 brought fresh economic challenges in the form of Russia-Ukraine war that impacted almost all major economies of the world, slowed the pace of growth, pushed inflation to record highs.As a result, the central banks of all advanced economies spurred into action and opted for monetary policy tightening to curb the soaring inflation.With persistently rising interest rates, India's economy grew by 4.4% in Q3 of FY23, as the Centre revised upwards GDP growth for previous year to 9.10% from 8.7% earlier.The report weighed recent GDP numbers against the available data on savings and investments for the past decade and highlighted some interesting points.""Quarterly growth numbers are noisy and should be best avoided for any serious interpretation (on an average, India's GDP growth has witnessed Rs 2 lakh crore upward revision for the 3 year ended FY23),"" the report said.Gross capital formation (GCF) by the government touched a high of 11.8% in 2021-22, up from 10.7% in 2020-21.""This also had a domino effect on private sector investment that jumped from 10 per cent to 10.8% over the same period,"" it said.In fact, Ecowrap added that the trends in GCF to gross output ratio or the plough back of funds for creation of fresh capacity shows that for public administration the ratio attained fresh peak in 2021-22 owing to the emphasis on capital expenditure in recent budgets.At the aggregate level, gross capital formation is supposed to have crossed 32% in 2022-23, the highest level since 2018-19.According to the report, in 2021-22, gross savings have risen to 30% from 29% in 2020-21.""The ratio is supposed to have crossed 31 per cent in 2022-23, the highest since 2018-19. The household savings increased sharply during the pandemic period on account of sharp accretion in financial savings such as deposits,"" said the report by SBI's Economic Research Department.While household financial savings have since then moderated from 15.4% in 2020-21 to 11.1% in 2022-23, savings in physical assets have grown sharply to 11.8% in 2021-22 from 10.7% in 2020-21.The report further analysed Incremental Capital Output ratio (ICOR) -- which measures additional units of capital (investment) needed to produce additional units of output. It said that the ratio has been improving.""ICOR which was 7.5 in FY 12 is now only 3.5 in FY22. Clearly, only half of capital is now needed for next unit of output,"" the report noted.Such reducing ICOR in the current years reflects a relatively increasing efficiency of capital and shows that the economy is on a sound footing, the report said.""From that point of view, future GDP growth rates even at 7% could still mean a decent number by any standards!,"" it added.","India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%. Raghuram Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying""","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-98483158,imgsize-65724,width-400,resizemode-4/98483158.jpg"

An employee is entitled for a 50 per cent amount of the last drawn salary as pension.OPS was discontinued by the NDA government in 2003 with effect from April 1, 2004.Under the new pension scheme (NPS), employees contribute 10 per cent of their basic salary towards pension while the government contributes 14 per cent.Governments of Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand have informed the central government/ Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA about their decision to restart OPS for their employees.The government of Punjab on November 18, 2022, issued a notification regarding implementation of OPS for the state government employees who are being covered under NPS.

NEW DELHI: Consumption of petrol, diesel and jet fuel continued to gallop apace in February, prompted by early onset of summer and harvesting pushing up demand from the farm sector and increased mobility prompted by expanding economic activities.Early trade data shows petrol consumption rising 13%, diesel 12% and jet fuel almost 41% over the same month a year ago.

Harvesting in states that have early harvesting further boosted the demand.","Petrol consumption rose 13%, diesel 12% and jet fuel almost 41% over the same month a year ago.

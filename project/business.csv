Top stock market recommendations:After a bearish engulfing pattern formation at the start of this week, Nifty has been facing selling pressure to rise up further. A retest of sub 25250 is likely to play out in the next 2-3 trading sessions which will also be its retest of cup and handle breakout seen earlier last week. Despite an underlying current being strong lifting the index to 9 month highs and only 3% away from its all-time highs - the MMI greed and fear index for Indian equities has entered the ‘extreme greed’ zone with a reading above 74/100. Charts have opened up for 26000+ and a support seen at 25250.Bank Nifty has made an engulfing bearish formation yesterday on daily charts. A close just below its trailed support of 57000 has also been claimed in Wednesday’s closing. Charts on the index continue to look stretched and rise between 57150 -57200 are likely to get sold into for lower targets nearing 56300 odd.Titagarh Rail Systems has closed at 5 month highs, after giving multiple breakouts in daily and weekly timeframes in the month of June.A fresh 6 month trendline breakout has also been observed last week which is likely to lift the stock 10% higher from its breakout point of 938.Marking an end to its 9 month correction, charts of ICICI Prudential Life Insurance have given a bullish breakout from a sloping trendline which was in place from Oct 2024. Resistance of 200 DMA has also been reclaimed earlier this week while momentum is set to pick up on sustaining or closing above 667 for targets of 8-10% higher.Bullish pole and flag breakout after crossing over its 200 DMA has been spotted on daily charts of CESC. Along with this, a 9 month trendline breakout is also seen on higher timeframe charts hinting towards the stock price scaling for fresh all time highs. For now, we are projecting 190 as targets in this leg, however upside for 215+ remains open.","According to Aakash K Hindocha, Deputy Vice President - WM Research, Titagarh Rail Systems, ICICI Prudential Life Insurance, and CESC are the top buy calls for today.

"Indian Railways announces three big steps for train ticketing! New charting, Tatkal ticket booking, reservation system",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/infrastructure/indian-railways-announces-three-big-steps-for-train-ticketing-new-charting-tatkal-ticket-booking-reservation-system-what-they-means-for-passengers/articleshow/122143108.cms,"We take a look at the top three upcoming changes in train ticketing and what they mean for passengers:

We take a look at the top three upcoming changes in train ticketing and what they mean for passengers:

Train Chart Preparation 8 Hours in Advance

Currently, Indian Railways prepares reservation charts four hours prior to train departure. This uncertainty particularly affects those travelling from nearby locations to board their trains.

To address this concern, a new proposal suggests preparing reservation charts eight hours before departure time.

For trains scheduled before 1400 hours on a day, charts will be finalised at 2100 hrs on the preceding day.

The Railway Minister has endorsed this suggestion and instructed phased implementation to ensure smooth transition.

This revised system will provide clarity to passengers holding waitlisted tickets. They will receive updates about their waitlist status earlier than before.

The change will particularly assist travellers from distant areas or city outskirts who plan to board long-distance trains. Additionally, passengers will have sufficient time to plan alternative travel arrangements if their waitlisted tickets remain unconfirmed.

Only Verified Users for Tatkal Ticket Booking

Indian Railways has announced that starting July 1, 2025, only verified users will be permitted to book Tatkal tickets through the IRCTC website and mobile application.

through the IRCTC website and mobile application. Additionally, the implementation of OTP-based authentication for Tatkal bookings will commence from end of July.

The Railways Minister has directed the officials to expand the authentication process for Tatkal reservations.

Users will need to verify their identity using either Aadhaar or other valid government identification documents stored in their DigiLocker accounts.

Earlier, it had been announced that only Aadhaar-authenticated users will be able to book tatkal tickets from July 1, 2025. The scope of that is now being expanded to include documents in DigiLocker.

New Passenger Reservation System by December 2025

The Railways Minister conducted an assessment of passenger reservation system improvements. CRIS has been implementing this enhancement project over recent months.

The enhanced PRS infrastructure demonstrates adaptability, flexibility and expanded capacity, capable of managing ten times the existing volume. This substantial upgrade will boost ticket booking capabilities significantly.

The modernised system will facilitate over 150,000 ticket reservations per minute, representing a fivefold increase from the current capacity of 32,000 tickets per minute.

The system's enquiry processing ability will see a tenfold enhancement, expanding from 400,000 to more than 4 million enquiries per minute.

The upgraded PRS features a user-friendly interface supporting multiple languages for bookings and enquiries.

The enhanced system enables users to specify seating preferences and view fare calendars. Additionally, it incorporates dedicated facilities for Divyangjan, students, patients and other specific categories.

Indian Railways train ticket operations set for a major revamp: In a move aimed at enhancing comfort for passengers, Indian Railways is planning to gradually roll out three key changes to its passenger reservation system. The steps will involve a new procedure for booking tatkal train tickets, advance chart preparation for waitlisted passengers and the overall upgradation of the passenger reservation system.During a recent assessment of these improvements, Railway Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw stressed the importance of developing an intelligent, clear, user-friendly and productive ticketing system. The primary focus of planning should be passenger comfort, ensuring that travellers experience seamless and pleasant journeys throughout their rail travel, he has said.Indian Railways is planning to either remove or reduce the clerical charges, commonly referred to as ""clerkage"", which is currently deducted during the refund process for cancelled or unconfirmed waitlisted tickets. At present, a clerkage charge of Rs 60 is levied on both AC and non-AC reserved tickets, while Rs 30 is charged for unreserved second class tickets. This fee is applicable to all cancellations of waitlisted tickets, including those made via the IRCTC website.Officials told TOI that preliminary discussions have started regarding this matter. Should the Railways implement this change, it would benefit passengers holding waitlisted tickets who currently face two challenges: their tickets remaining unconfirmed and the subsequent deduction of clerkage charges during fare refunds.","Indian Railways is planning to gradually roll out three key changes to its passenger reservation system.

US plans ‘economic bunker buster’ bill: Will Donald Trump impose 500% tariff on countries importing oil from Russia? How it may impact India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/russian-sanctions-bill-us-planning-to-impose-500-per-cent-tariffs-on-nations-trading-with-moscow-how-will-this-impact-india/articleshow/122196023.cms,"The transformation in India's oil import strategy has been remarkable, with Russian oil's share increasing from less than 1 per cent to roughly 40-44%.

EU Nations Buying Russia Oil ‘FRUSTRATE’ Zelensky; Ukraine President Goes On Ugly Rant | Watch





What’s the 500% tariff threat about?

The proposed sanctions legislation, which has garnered support from 84 co-sponsors as noted by Graham, seeks to exert pressure on nations such as India and China to cease purchasing Russian oil and commodities. The objective is to diminish Moscow's wartime economy and compel Russian President Vladimir Putin to engage in negotiations regarding Ukraine, whilst providing Trump with necessary authority.

The bill, first introduced in March, is anticipated to advance in August. This initiative aligns with the United States' intensified measures to impose stricter economic restrictions on Russia, as Trump attempts to persuade Putin towards diplomatic discussions amidst the ongoing Ukraine conflict.

The Senate postponed introducing the legislation following the White House's resistance to broadening sanctions during Trump's endeavours to improve relations with the Russian leader. Nevertheless, the administration now appears prepared to endorse these restrictive measures.

How will it impact India?

Hence, a 500% tariff on countries importing oil from Russia may impact India very badly. Incidentally, India has also stepped up oil imports from America. United States crude oil exports to India saw a substantial rise, reaching 439,000 barrels per day in June, marking a notable increase from the 280,000 barrels per day recorded in May.

Will Trump really sign the 500% tariff order?

Russia's Response to The Bill

India, a large importer of crude oil from Russia, may have to watch out for a new US bill which proposes imposing a 500% tariff on countries that import from Russia. In an interview with ABC News, Senator Lindsey Graham said that he wanted the US to impose tariffs to stop them from supporting Vladimir Putin's war machine. Moscow launched full-scale invasion of Ukraine three years ago on February 24, 2022.""Big breakthrough here. So what does this bill do? If you're buying products from Russia and you're not helping Ukraine, then there's a 500 percent tariff on your products coming into the United States. India and China buy 70 percent of Putin's oil. They keep his war machine going. My bill has 84 co-sponsors. It would allow the president to put tariffs on China and India and other countries to get them -- stop them from supporting Putin's war machine, to get him to the table. For the first time yesterday, the president told me,"" Graham said.Also read: 'Economic bunker buster for India, China': How this US senator's Russia sanctions bill would prove 'bone crushing' for trade- if passed Graham has actively been advocating for the legislation, cautioning that it would serve as an ""economic bunker buster"" for nations such as India and China, which have substantially enhanced their imports of Russian petroleum products.India significantly altered its oil procurement patterns after Russia's Ukraine invasion in February 2022.The country transitioned from its traditional Middle Eastern suppliers to Russian oil sources, capitalising on favourable prices resulting from Western sanctions and European embargoes. Russian oil deliveries to India stood at 1.96 million barrels per day (bpd) in May.The transformation in India's oil import strategy has been remarkable, with Russian oil's share increasing from less than 1 per cent to roughly 40-44 per cent of total crude purchases in a short period.Also Read | India laps up discounted crude: RIL, Nayara Energy get big chunk of Russia’s flagship oil exports; Reliance world’s single biggest buyer of Urals India's Russian oil imports reached new heights in June, surpassing combined imports from Saudi Arabia and Iraq, during a period of market uncertainty following Israel's major offensive against Iran.As the world's third-largest oil importer and consumer, India has secured roughly 5.1 million barrels of international crude oil, which its refineries convert into various fuel products including petrol and diesel.""According to preliminary analysis by global trade analytics firm Kpler quoted in a PTI report, Indian refiners are expected to purchase 2-2.2 million barrels per day of Russian crude oil in June, reaching a two-year peak and exceeding the total quantities acquired from Iraq, Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Kuwait.""India has also become the primary recipient of Russian Urals oil grade transported by sea in 2025, receiving 80% of the total exports. The country's two private refineries have substantially boosted their imports of this lower-priced crude.According to Kpler statistics referenced in a Bloomberg report, India acquired 231 million barrels of Urals through June 24, with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Nayara Energy Ltd. jointly obtaining 45% of Russia's exports of this medium-sour grade.The proportion of Urals purchases by these two private Indian refiners has steadily increased in recent years, particularly in 2025. Reliance has positioned itself as the world's largest buyer of Urals, having purchased 77 million barrels in the current year.Graham has clarified that Trump would retain discretionary power through a waiver provision, enabling him to decide on the bill's implementation should it successfully pass through Congress.""I was playing with him (Trump). He says, ""It's time to move -- move your bill. There's a waiver in the bill, Mr. President. You're in charge whether or not it's to be implemented."" But we're going to give President Trump a tool in the toolbox he doesn't have today.

He belongs to a group of inveterate Russophobes. If it were up to him, these sanctions would have been imposed long ago,"" said Peskov.Peskov further questioned the effectiveness of such measures by stating, ""Would that have helped the (Ukraine) settlement (process)? That is a question that those who initiate such events should ask themselves.""","India is the world's third-largest oil importer and consumer.

Market pulse: Asian stocks edge up as investors brace for US jobs data; oil slips on demand worries,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/market-pulse-asian-stocks-edge-up-as-investors-brace-for-us-jobs-data-oil-slips-on-demand-worries/articleshow/122217076.cms,"Representative image (Picture credit: AP)

Asian shares inched higher on Thursday as investors awaited key US jobs data expected later in the day, hoping it would pave the way for interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve.The modest uptick in regional equities followed record closes on Wall Street after US President Donald Trump announced a new trade deal with Vietnam, fuelling optimism over global trade momentum.According to Reuters, MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.2 per cent, just below a four-year high. Japan’s Nikkei was flat, while China’s blue-chip CSI300 also gained 0.2 per cent.Hong Kong’s Hang Seng, however, slipped 0.6 per cent as data revealed China’s services activity grew at its slowest pace in nine months.The US labour market is in sharp focus, with June’s non-farm payrolls expected to show a 110,000 job gain and the unemployment rate ticking up to 4.3 per cent. The stakes are high after a private payroll report on Wednesday revealed the first contraction in over two years. “These labour market indicators warn of the risk that the unemployment rate could spike to 4.4 per cent, the highest since October 2021,” said Tony Sycamore of IG, as quoted by news agency Reuters.Markets are now pricing in a 70 per cent chance of a Fed rate cut in July, up from 25 per cent earlier this week. Ten-year US Treasury yields eased 2 basis points to 4.265 per cent, while the dollar continued to face pressure, hovering near a three-year low.The euro edged up 0.1 per cent to $1.1807, and the pound also rose slightly as concerns about UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves' future faded.Investor focus also remained on Trump’s tax and spending bill, which proposes $3.3 trillion in new debt while cutting social safety net programs.In commodities, oil prices retreated after a sharp 3 per cent rise in the previous session. Brent crude fell 24 cents to $68.87 a barrel, while US West Texas Intermediate dipped to $67.21.As per Reuters, the drop followed a surprise 3.8 million barrel increase in US crude inventories and weak gasoline demand, which dipped to 8.6 million barrels per day during the peak summer driving season.Despite recent support from geopolitical tensions, notably Iran’s suspension of cooperation with the UN nuclear watchdog, concerns over soft US consumption weighed on prices. Analysts noted that any dovish signals from the Fed on Thursday could reverse this sentiment by improving the demand outlook.Meanwhile, gold prices slipped 0.4 per cent to $3,342 an ounce amid dollar weakness and pre-data caution.As per Bloomberg, the cautious optimism in equity and bond markets underlines the high-stakes environment ahead of the US jobs release, a key signal for monetary policy and market direction globally.","MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.2 per cent.

NEW DELHI: In what has the potential to disturb India's strong march in manufacturing, tensions with China have seen the neighbouring country delay delivery of critical machinery while ordering the pullout of some of its citizens from Indian factories, including those engaged in engineering and manufacturing jobs at Foxconn, Apple's contract manufacturer.This comes just as China has also put curbs on export of magnets to India that are used in making of automobile and electronic products.Sources said there has been a ""massive pressure"" at the operations of Foxconn in India, with the Taiwanese giant employing a ""few hundred key Chinese personnel"" at its factories in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka.While their strength is less than 1% of employees, they play a key part in managing operations, including production and quality.

Questions sent to officials of Apple and Foxconn in India did not get any response.Govt sources said the problem has been festering for the last few months and the companies, given the large global presence, have tapped some of their other operations for manpower.The situation is equally worrisome at the operations of top Chinese phone companies such as Oppo and Vivo, that have large manufacturing facilities in the country.""While the companies have limited Chinese officials in India, they are worried about 'what more' can follow after this step. Please remember that both Apple and the Chinese makers import a lot of components from China that are used to manufacture final products in India,"" the source said.It is understood that Indian govt is seized of the matter, and there are also speculations that 'China may be doing a tit-for-tat on India', especially as their corporate personnel have faced a lot of issues in getting business visas. ""We intend to send a detailed report on the matter to the govt so that the issue is flagged off before it explodes into another crisis like the matter related to magnet supply,"" an industry source said.For Apple, India has emerged as a major production hub and the share of the company in India's export basket has grown severalfold in recent years and govt does not want any disruptions. Govt officials said that in the past China has often sought to block machinery to be used in key Indian factories after learning about the facility moving or coming up in India. These steps come at a time when companies are looking to diversify their production bases and are adding capacity in India, often at the expense of expanding in China or doing so at a slower pace.","Tensions with China have seen the neighbouring country delay delivery of critical machinery.

Tech firms and crypto startups are moving in on territory long dominated by Visa and Mastercard, powered by a new type of currency - the stablecoin - and a pitch merchants can't ignore: lower fees, faster settlement and a way to bypass the big two altogether.It's a tech threat and a financial threat. Digital tokens, which are typically pegged to the dollar, allow consumers to pay merchants directly from their crypto wallets - without routing payments through a bank or card network. Last year alone, US businesses paid an estimated $187 billion in swipe fees, most of it via Visa and Mastercard's systems.Stablecoins promise to make that toll much lower, or even obsolete. ""It's clear that eventually this entire space could be a threat to TradFi providers,"" said Christian Catalini, founder of MIT Cryptoeconomics Lab.That pressure is prompting Visa and Mastercard to brand themselves - not as old-school toll collectors - but as the backbone for all kinds of digital transactions, including those originally designed to bypass them. With Trump poised to sign the legislation that creates formal federal oversight of stablecoin issuers, they're touting enhancements to longstanding efforts in areas including stablecoin settlement and crypto-linked cards.Visa and Mastercard have also highlighted initiatives in cross-border payments, one of the most popular use cases for stablecoins.

Donald Trump’s tariffs may hit US employers in a big way, says JPMorganChase Institute analysis",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/whopping-82-3-billion-cost-donald-trumps-tariffs-may-hit-us-employers-in-a-big-way-says-jpmorganchase-institute-analysis/articleshow/122205626.cms,"Higher costs may push for alternate approaches

What comes after the 90-day pause

'Everything's going well'

US employers could be facing a $82.3 billion bill thanks to US President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariff regime, a new report has revealed. This could be a deep financial toll on American businesses, potentially triggering price hikes, layoffs, hiring freezes or lower profit margins.The report, Exposure to tariffs for midsize firms by metro area, published by the JPMorganChase Institute, is among the first to quantify the immediate impact on mid-sized American companies with annual revenues between $10 million and $1 billion, according to an AP report.These firms, employing roughly one-third of the country’s private-sector workforce, are majorly dependent on imports from countries like China, India and Thailand, with retail and wholesale sectors seen as especially vulnerable to the import taxes.The findings directly challenge Trump’s claims that the burden of tariffs would fall on foreign manufacturers, not US firms. While inflation has so far remained stable, retail giants such as Amazon, Costco and Walmart had anticipated disruption by stockpiling goods before tariffs took effect.The timing of the analysis is crucial, coming almost a week ahead of the July 9 deadline, set by Trump to finalise tariff rates on imports from dozens of countries.The deadline came after financial markets were rattled by his April announcements, prompting him to schedule a 90-day negotiating period. Had the April 2 tariffs stayed in place, the same group of firms would have faced a steeper hit of $187.6 billion.Based on the current rates, the average cost per employee would be around $2,080 amounting to 3.1% of a typical company’s annual payroll. This also includes employees from firms that do not rely on import goods.“Our estimation explicitly considers direct costs, defined as costs to firms that physically import goods and pay the import tariffs, and is based on goods trade amounts from 2022, the latest year for which all data are available,” the report said.After the import tariffs come into effect the importer may switch to manage these costs through a variety of approaches. These might include raising sales prices or switching to a different supplier subjected to lower or no tariffs. However, it might also not be a feasible option as alternative suppliers may charge higher prices and in some cases, alternate suppliers might not even exist.As the 90-day period comes to an end, only the United Kingdom has signed a trade framework so far. India and Vietnam have also said that they are also close to locking in a deal with the US.There is a growing concern that tariffs might push inflation.Goldman Sachs forecasted that US companies are likely to pass along 60% of their tariff costs to consumers. A separate survey by the Atlanta Federal Reserve also suggested that around half of the costs from 10% to 25% tariffs could be shifted to customers without affecting consumer demand.The JPMorganChase report also noted that the tariffs may present an opportunity for domestic manufacturers to strengthen their supply chains. However, given the already narrow margins in retail and wholesale, many companies may have little choice but to pass on additional costs to the customers.When asked on Tuesday about the status of ongoing trade talks, Trump offered a brief reply.“Everything’s going well,” he said.Treasury secretary Scott Bessent defended the administration’s strategy, claiming long-serving government officials have been impressed with the progress.“People who have been at Treasury, at Commerce, at USTR for 20 years are saying that these are deals like they’ve never seen before,” Bessent told Fox News Channel’s Fox & Friends on Tuesday.The Trump administration is also expected to begin mapping out its broader trade deal plans next week.In the meantime, Trump linked the success of the tariff policy to funding a newly passed multitrillion-dollar tax cuts package, which Republicans pushed through the Senate on Tuesday.","US employers could be facing a $82.3 billion bill thanks to US President Donald Trump's sweeping tariff regime.

Tesla EV sales plunge! 13% drop in three months; anti-Elon Musk sentiment harms,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/tesla-ev-sales-plunge-13-drop-in-three-months-anti-elon-musk-sentiment-harms/articleshow/122208236.cms,".

Elon Musk owned Tesla is feeling the heat as his political opinion has been casting a shadow over the company's sales since the last three months. Over the period, the sales of Tesla electric cars have fallen 13%, with predictions that the EV giant could also disappoint with its earnings.Between April and June, Tesla sold 384,122 vehicles, down from 443,956 during the same period last year. The drop highlighted a persistent backlash against Musk’s increasingly vocal support for US President Donald Trump and far-right political figures in Europe, despite earlier expectations that public anger might ease over time.The figures also raise concerns over Tesla’s upcoming second quarter earnings report, due later this month. In the first quarter, the company’s net income dropped by a sharp 71%, adding pressure to deliver more promising financials.Interestingly, while overall deliveries dipped, sales of the more affordable Models 3 and Y reached 373,728, beating Wall Street estimates of around 356,000. The better-than-expected performance in this segment gave Tesla shares a 4% boost in premarket trading.Earlier hopes for a rebound had grown after Musk officially stepped away from a role in the Trump administration, where he had served briefly as a cost-cutting adviser.","Tesla sold 384,122 vehicles, down from 443,956 during the same period last year.

No H-1B visa? No problem: Here are the top alternate US work visa options,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/no-h-1b-visa-no-problem-here-are-the-top-alternate-us-work-visa-options-explained/articleshow/122197561.cms,"This is an AI-generated image, used for representational purposes only.

Indian Students Face New Uncertainty: US Plan For Fixed-Term Visa Tenure May Impact Careersus visa

1. Planning ahead for future H-1B cycles





Begin early and be ready with the information in advance to ensure compliance with all requirements.

Consider other options to register, where applicable, within legal guidelines.

Track policy updates from USCIS that may affect the process.

2. Cap-exempt H-1B employment





Nonprofit colleges and universities

Nonprofit research organisations

Governmental research institutions

3. Intracompany transfers: The L-1 visa





The employee must have worked for the foreign office for at least one continuous year within the last three years prior to entering the US. The work must have been in a managerial, executive, or specialised knowledge capacity.

The position in the US must be similar to the role the employee held abroad, meaning it must also be managerial, executive, or require specialised knowledge. The US entity must also have a qualifying corporate relationship with the foreign entity (such as parent, branch, subsidiary, or affiliate).

This visa supports both short-term assignments and long-term employment in the US and may also provide a pathway to permanent residency through the EB-1C category.

4. The O-1 visa: For individuals with extraordinary ability





5. Country-specific visas





The E-3 visa is available exclusively to Australian citizens working in speciality occupations, similar to the H-1B. One of its notable advantages is that the spouses of E-3 visa holders are also eligible to work in the United States.

The TN visa, offered under the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), is available to citizens of Canada and Mexico. It covers a broad range of professional occupations, including engineers, scientists, medical professionals, and teachers. The TN visa is relatively straightforward to obtain and does not have an annual cap, making it a viable and efficient alternative for those who qualify.

The H-1B1 visa is specifically designed for citizens of Chile and Singapore. Like the H-1B, it allows individuals to work in speciality occupations, but with a separate annual quota (within the overall cap of 85,000) that is typically underutilised. As a result, applicants from these countries face less competition and a higher likelihood of approval.

6. J-1 visa: Interns and trainees





J-1 trainee visa: This category is intended for those who have earned a degree or professional certification and possess a minimum of one year of relevant work experience outside the US. The purpose is to enhance their skills in a structured training environment related to their current occupation. The maximum duration for a J-1 Trainee visa is 18 months, except for the hospitality field, which is limited to 12 months.

J-1 Intern Visa: This option is intended for current students or recent graduates (within 12 months of graduation) from a post-secondary academic institution outside the United States. Internships must closely align with the participant’s area of academic study. The maximum duration for a J-1 Intern visa is 12 months.

7. B-1 in lieu of H-1B visa







The employee must remain on a foreign payroll.

The work must be temporary, short-term, and within the employee’s area of expertise.

Requires meticulous compliance with rules to avoid visa misuse.

8. Further education opportunities





STEM OPT Extension: Students with degrees in science, technology, engineering, or math (STEM) fields may be eligible for a 24-month extension to their initial 12-month OPT, allowing them to work in the US for up to three years. To qualify, the job must be directly related to the STEM degree, and the employer must be enrolled in the E-Verify program. This extension offers additional time to build experience and submit a new application for the H-1B lottery in subsequent years.

Day 1 CPT Programs: Some universities offer Curricular Practical Training (CPT) that allows students to begin working from the first day of enrollment. These programs must be approached with caution, as misuse or non-compliant institutions can raise red flags during future visa or immigration reviews. Always consult with a qualified immigration attorney and choose accredited universities with strong reputations to ensure compliance.

9. Employment abroad and re-entry





It keeps the employee within the company’s ecosystem.

After one year, the employee may become eligible for an L-1 transfer to the US

10. Green card sponsorship





The H-1B visa lottery is a critical step for many companies in the United States looking to employ highly skilled foreign professionals.However, with only 85,000 visas available annually (including 20,000 reserved for those with advanced degrees from US institutions) and hundreds of thousands of applications submitted each year, many qualified individuals are left without a path forward.This leaves employers facing tough decisions about retaining top international talent.Fortunately, there are alternative visa options and strategic pathways that may work for your company. These can help affected employees remain in the US legally or return later with a more secure status.According to ET guest author Poorvi Chothani, managing partner at LawQuest, the key lies in planning, strategy, and using a combination of other visa pathways. She describes ways in which HR professionals can navigate this complex situation.Although an employee may not have been selected in the current year’s H-1B lottery, there’s always the potential for subsequent selection rounds.The US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) may conduct additional lotteries if initially selected applicants do not proceed with filing. To improve the chances for next year you may want to:Some organisations are not subject to the H-1B annual cap. These typically include institutions such as:Employees can work for such institutions year-round without needing to go through the H-1B lottery.Furthermore, if they are employed at a cap-exempt organisation, a cap-subject employer may be able to file for concurrent employment, allowing them to work (often part-time) at both places simultaneously.If the employer operates offices or affiliated organisations in foreign countries outside the United States, the L-1 visa provides a strong alternative to the H-1B. This visa allows companies to transfer certain employees to a US branch, subsidiary, or affiliate:The O-1 visa is well-suited for individuals who have demonstrated extraordinary ability or significant accomplishments in fields such as science, education, the arts, business, or athletics.To qualify, applicants must meet rigorous criteria, which may include receiving national or international awards, having notable publications or scholarly contributions, or making original contributions that have advanced their field.This visa serves as a strong alternative for highly accomplished professionals who are not selected in the H-1B lottery, offering them a pathway to live and work in the United States based on their exceptional achievements.Country-specific visas provide valuable alternatives for individuals who are not selected in the H-1B lottery. These visa categories are tailored for nationals of specific countries and often come with less competition, making them more accessible compared to the standard H-1B visa:For eligible candidates, these country-specific visas can serve as excellent alternatives to the H-1B lottery, providing a legal pathway to live and work in the United States with fewer hurdles.The J-1 visa offers a valuable alternative pathway for individuals seeking to gain professional experience in the United States through structured exchange programs. Although not considered traditional work visas, J-1 visas allow participants to engage in on-the-job training or internships sponsored by approved organisations.There are two main categories under the J-1 visa that are relevant for professionals:While these visas do not confer the same employment rights as an H-1B, they allow participants to gain valuable US work experience under the supervision of a designated program sponsor.For temporary work assignments requiring specialised skills, the B-1 visa in lieu of an H-1B can be used under specific conditions:Employees on F-1 Optional Practical Training (OPT) may consider continuing their education to maintain legal status and enhance future immigration opportunities:Employees not selected can also consider working for their US employer from an affiliated overseas office. This serves two purposes:Although it’s a long-term option for specific individuals who are subject to annual quotas based on their place of birth, starting the employment-based green card process signals a commitment to retaining valuable staff.While it does not provide immediate work authorisation, it lays out a pathway for permanent residence and work eligibility.Chothani concludes that although not being selected in the H-1B lottery can feel like a setback, “a wide array of alternative visas and strategies exist to ensure that valued international employees can still contribute meaningfully to US companies.”HR professionals are encouraged to collaborate with experienced immigration attorneys and maintain transparent, supportive communication with affected employees.(With inputs from guest column of Poorvi Chothani, managing partner at LawQuest that appeared in ET)","The H-1B1 visa is specifically designed for citizens of Chile and Singapore.

Employer-approved electronic exit permit

Kuwait began enforcing a new electronic exit permit system for expatriate workers in the private sector, in a move that marks a major shift in the country’s labour and travel policies.From July 1, 2025, all foreign employees under Article 18 of the Foreigners’ Residence Law must obtain prior approval from their employer to travel abroad. The e-permit system, launched by the Public Authority for Manpower (PAM), is part of Kuwait’s wider digital transformation and labour market reform agenda.Authorities said that the system has seen a strong early response, with more than 36,000 applications submitted within hours of launch, ET reported.Under the new rule, expatriate workers in the private sector must secure an electronic exit permit before travelling. The permit must be applied for via the Sahel Individuals mobile app and approved through the As-hal Companies portal. Employers or sponsors are required to review and approve the request through the As-hal Companies portal.The system runs 24/7, including weekends, for ease of access. According to the Public Authority for Manpower (PAM), the regulation is designed to streamline exit procedures, enhance transparency, and safeguard workers' rights.The outbound traffic at Kuwait International Airport remained smooth on the first day of the new exit permit rule. The first flight under the regulation, an Air India service to India, departed at 12:45 am without any delays, followed closely by another India-bound flight.Authorities, including the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), the ministry of interior, and several airlines, worked in coordination to ensure seamless airport operations. Despite the busy summer travel period, the new rule did not cause any disruptions or delays for departing passengers.Airlines have started issuing advisories, warning expatriate travellers on work visas that flight bookings will be cancelled if the mandatory exit permit is missing at check-in. In such cases, no refunds or alternate bookings will be offered, as per ET.Passengers are being urged to confirm the following before heading to the airport:The regulation aligns Kuwait with Gulf neighbours like Saudi Arabia, Oman and Bahrain, which already operate similar systems, as per AFP.The new regulation also strengthened the existing sponsorship-based residency system, where employers hold significant control over various aspects of a foreign worker’s legal status.It was introduced via a ministerial directive issued by first deputy prime minister Sheikh Fahad Yousef. The e-permit system comes amid a wave of new immigration laws passed in late 2024, which include tighter penalties for violations, contract limits, and a ban on deducting administrative fees from salaries. Kuwait has also raised the minimum salary requirement for sponsoring family visas to KD 800 per month.Although the exit permit system is intended to promote more organised labour market management, some human rights groups have expressed concerns that it could further tighten employer control and restrict workers' freedom of movement.","Kuwait has introduced a new electronic exit permit system for expatriate workers in the private sector.

US stock market today: Dow falls over 100 points while Nasdaq up 0.3%; investors cautious ahead of US job data,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-stock-market-today-dow-falls-over-100-points-while-nasdaq-up-0-3-investors-cautious-ahead-of-us-job-data/articleshow/122208253.cms,"Representative Image

US stocks started the day mixed on Wednesday as investors turned cautious ahead of a crucial US jobs report due on Thursday.The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 111 points, or 0.25%, reaching 44,383.86. S&P 500 rose a marginal 1.79 points or 0.33%, trading at 6,199.80. Tech-heavy Nasdaq also reached 20,270.24, rising 67.35 points or 0.33%.The jitters come after data released from ADP showed an unexpected fall in private-sector employment last month. Employers outside the government reportedly cut 33,000 jobs, a stark contrast to economists’ forecasts of a 115,000-job gain.“Though layoffs continue to be rare, a hesitancy to hire and a reluctance to replace departing workers led to job losses last month,” said Nela Richardson, chief economist at ADP.Many of the planned tariffs, a key part of Trump’s trade strategy, remain on hold but are expected to take effect within a week. Their potential to disrupt supply chains and drive up prices has left businesses wary, possibly leading to hiring freezes or slowdowns.Adding to the drag, the US government’s recent termination of temporary protected status for roughly 350,000 Venezuelans could knock up to 25,000 jobs off the payroll, according to Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle.Bond markets reflected the mixed mood. The 10-year Treasury yield nudged up to 4.29% from 4.26%, while the more Fed-sensitive two-year yield dipped slightly to 3.77%.A weaker-than-expected jobs report could prompt the Federal Reserve to consider cutting interest rates sooner than planned. But so far, the Fed has signalled a wait-and-watch approach, preferring to assess the impact of Trump’s tariff strategy before adjusting monetary policy.","The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 111 points, or 0.25%, reaching 44,383.86.

Oracle stock surges: Hits record high on $30 billion cloud deal; revenue to flow from FY28,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/oracle-stock-surges-hits-record-high-on-30-billion-cloud-deal-revenue-to-flow-from-fy28/articleshow/122203399.cms,"Representative image

Oracle Corp’s stock soared 4% on Monday to a record $218.63 after a regulatory filing revealed a major cloud computing agreement that could add more than $30 billion in annual revenue beginning fiscal 2028.The deal, which was disclosed ahead of a company-wide meeting, marks a significant milestone in Oracle’s pivot to AI infrastructure and cloud services.CEO Safra Catz, in a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing, said Oracle is “off to a strong start in FY26,” adding, “Our MultiCloud database revenue continues to grow at over 100%, and we signed multiple large cloud services agreements including one that is expected to contribute more than $30 billion in annual revenue starting in FY28,” reported CNBC.Oracle did not name the customer, but speculation is high that it may be tied to OpenAI and SoftBank’s $500 billion Stargate project, which aims to create a vast global network of AI data centres.Founder Larry Ellison had earlier hinted in March that Oracle expected to finalise a deal with Stargate “fairly soon.”The $30 billion figure is nearly triple the $10.3 billion Oracle generated from its data centre operations in FY25, reported Financial Times.The deal won’t impact Oracle’s FY26 guidance, but it cements its growing clout in the cloud and AI sectors. Analysts believe the revenue surge reflects long-term demand for computing infrastructure amid supply constraints at competitors like Microsoft.As per Financial Times, Oracle is spending around $40 billion on Nvidia’s high-performance chips to power new data centres for OpenAI in Abilene, Texas. Although Stargate is “still in formation,” Catz told investors that the company had already booked some revenue from OpenAI, with more coming from other contracts.Oracle’s stock has jumped over 33% in 2024, buoyed by strong earnings, cloud expansion, and strategic AI tie-ups. These include a recent partnership with IBM and the Stargate venture. Earlier this year, Oracle also inked a cloud services deal with Chinese e-commerce giant Temu, adding further weight to its global ambitions.Having been slow to enter the cloud computing market, Oracle now finds itself among the top beneficiaries of surging demand for AI processing power.With this blockbuster cloud deal, the Austin-based tech giant appears well-positioned to capitalise on the next wave of digital transformation.","Oracle Corp’s stock soared 4% on Monday to a record $218.63.

Paramount’s $16 million settlement: CBS parent company ready to end Donald Trump's lawsuit over Kamala Harris interview; awaits federal approval,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/paramounts-16-million-settlement-cbs-parent-company-ready-to-end-donald-trumps-lawsuit-over-kamala-harris-interview-awaits-federal-approval/articleshow/122201414.cms,"(Image credits: AP)

Paramount, the parent company of CBS, has agreed to pay $16 million to settle a lawsuit filed by US President Donald Trump over the contents of a “60 Minutes” interview with former vice president Kamala Harris during the 2024 presidential campaign.The settlement resolves Trump’s $20 billion lawsuit, which alleged that CBS edited the interview to omit an embarrassing response from Harris. Trump initially sought $10 billion in damages before raising the demand to $20 billion.CBS defended the editing of the Harris interview as standard practice. Legal experts had widely criticised Trump’s lawsuit as baseless and unlikely to succeed due to constitutional protections for freedom of the press.Despite confidence in its legal position, Paramount opted for mediation amid efforts to finalise an $8 billion merger with entertainment company Skydance.The deal is subject to federal approval, and the settlement may have been part of a strategy to avoid political complications.According to a statement from Paramount published by the Los Angeles Times on Tuesday, the $16 million settlement will not go to Trump personally but will instead be used for his future presidential library.While Paramount did not apologise or admit wrongdoing, it agreed to release transcripts of “60 Minutes” interviews with future presidential candidates as part of the settlement.The lawsuit also had internal repercussions at CBS News. “60 Minutes” executive producer Bill Owens resigned in April, followed by CBS News chief executive Wendy McMahon in May.","Paramount, the parent company of CBS, has agreed to pay $16 million to settle a lawsuit filed by US President Donald Trump.

Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has offloaded over 3.3 million shares of the tech giant, netting approximately $736.7 million, as per a regulatory filing reported by Bloomberg.The transactions, carried out in late June, coincided with Bezos’ lavish three-day wedding to Lauren Sanchez in Venice, a celebration that drew global attention and protests from some locals.The share sale is part of a pre-scheduled 10b5-1 trading plan Bezos adopted in March, allowing him to sell up to 25 million Amazon shares through May 2026. According to CNBC, Bezos implemented a similar plan in early 2024 to sell up to 50 million shares by January this year.Following the latest transaction, Bezos still holds around 905 million Amazon shares, maintaining his status as the company’s largest individual shareholder. Since 2002, Bezos has sold about $44 billion worth of Amazon stock, noted Bloomberg, while making only one recorded purchase, a single share in 2022.The billionaire, who stepped down as Amazon CEO in 2021 but remains executive chair, is known to use stock proceeds to fund his ventures, most notably Blue Origin. The aerospace company recently launched its flagship rocket into orbit, though it announced significant layoffs soon after.Bezos has also donated generously. In 2025, he gifted nearly 930,000 Amazon shares to undisclosed nonprofits. According to Bloomberg, he reported donations worth $60 million in March, followed by gifts of $125 million in May and $5 million in June. Most of these contributions support the Bezos Earth Fund, a $10 billion climate initiative and the Bezos Day One Fund, which tackles homelessness and supports early education.The timing of the stock sale with his wedding was widely noted. As per CNBC, the Venice ceremony cost an estimated $50 million.According to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, Bezos is the world’s third-richest individual with a net worth of approximately $241.4 billion.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume.

Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021.

Startups will play important role in helping India become 3rd largest economy: CEA Nageswaran,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/startups-will-play-important-role-in-helping-india-become-3rd-largest-economy-cea-nageswaran/articleshow/105332523.cms,"Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor ( CEA ) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran Udaan until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.Udaan built an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business still accounts for a very small part of India’s overall retail market but can balloon to $150 billion in sales and yield a 100% return on capital invested in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co. estimates published in the Mint newspaper.Bengaluru-based Udaan has also ventured into financing through its fintech unit which helps shopkeepers get working capital loans to buy inventory. That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says.

How India's GDP has been growing

What SBI report said on savings and investment

Incremental capital output ratio

NEW DELHI: India's gross domestic product (GDP) data for the third quarter (October-December 2022) received a word of caution from the former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan In an interview with news agency PTI, Rajan that India is ""dangerously close"" to the Hindu rate of growth in view of subdued private sector investment, high interest rates and slowing global growth.India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying"".However, a report released by the State Bank of India (SBI) economists on Tuesday dismissed arguments that India is dangerously close to Hindu rate of growth saying such statements are ""ill-conceived, biased and premature"".The term 'Hindu growth rate' was coined by late economist Raj Krishna in 1978 to describe the slow growth in the country.It basically refers to the low pace of economic growth rates during 1950s to 1980s. During this period, the Indian economy averaged 3.5%.A former lecturer at the Delhi School of Economics (DSE), Krishna noted that only if the rate of growth is persistently slow and accompanied by low per-capita GDP, then it will be known as Hindu rate of growth but it has to factor in population growth as well.Before economic reforms of 1991, India's economic growth remained stagnant and low, while per capita income averaged around 1.3%. Krishna termed this low growth situation to be a result of socialist policies of state control and import substitution.However, the economic situation changed when liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation (LPG) reforms came into effect in the year 1991, at a time when India faced balance of payment crisis.Over the years, many economists have strongly opposed the idea of 'Hindu growth rate' and the term never had universal acceptance.The Indian economy plunged into its very first technical recession in FY21 due to the impact of Covid-19 pandemic and the related nationwide lockdowns. GDP shrunk by an unprecedented 23.8% in the first quarter of the financial year 2020-21. However, due to spurt in economic activities in the subsequent quarters, the GDP decline started to narrow.However, if we look at the period before Covid-19 as well, India's growth curve shows a declining trend.From 8.26% in FY17, GDP growth plunged to 3.74% in FY20. Shutdown of economic activities in FY21 in wake of Covid-19 only made matters worse.As lockdowns started to ease and business activities resumed, India's GDP also started rising. In Q1 of FY22, growth jumped to 20.1% mainly on account of low base effect. By the fourth quarter of FY22, growth came down to 4.10%.Similarly, the new financial year 2022-23 brought fresh economic challenges in the form of Russia-Ukraine war that impacted almost all major economies of the world, slowed the pace of growth, pushed inflation to record highs.As a result, the central banks of all advanced economies spurred into action and opted for monetary policy tightening to curb the soaring inflation.With persistently rising interest rates, India's economy grew by 4.4% in Q3 of FY23, as the Centre revised upwards GDP growth for previous year to 9.10% from 8.7% earlier.The report weighed recent GDP numbers against the available data on savings and investments for the past decade and highlighted some interesting points.""Quarterly growth numbers are noisy and should be best avoided for any serious interpretation (on an average, India's GDP growth has witnessed Rs 2 lakh crore upward revision for the 3 year ended FY23),"" the report said.Gross capital formation (GCF) by the government touched a high of 11.8% in 2021-22, up from 10.7% in 2020-21.""This also had a domino effect on private sector investment that jumped from 10 per cent to 10.8% over the same period,"" it said.In fact, Ecowrap added that the trends in GCF to gross output ratio or the plough back of funds for creation of fresh capacity shows that for public administration the ratio attained fresh peak in 2021-22 owing to the emphasis on capital expenditure in recent budgets.At the aggregate level, gross capital formation is supposed to have crossed 32% in 2022-23, the highest level since 2018-19.According to the report, in 2021-22, gross savings have risen to 30% from 29% in 2020-21.""The ratio is supposed to have crossed 31 per cent in 2022-23, the highest since 2018-19. The household savings increased sharply during the pandemic period on account of sharp accretion in financial savings such as deposits,"" said the report by SBI's Economic Research Department.While household financial savings have since then moderated from 15.4% in 2020-21 to 11.1% in 2022-23, savings in physical assets have grown sharply to 11.8% in 2021-22 from 10.7% in 2020-21.The report further analysed Incremental Capital Output ratio (ICOR) -- which measures additional units of capital (investment) needed to produce additional units of output. It said that the ratio has been improving.""ICOR which was 7.5 in FY 12 is now only 3.5 in FY22. Clearly, only half of capital is now needed for next unit of output,"" the report noted.Such reducing ICOR in the current years reflects a relatively increasing efficiency of capital and shows that the economy is on a sound footing, the report said.""From that point of view, future GDP growth rates even at 7% could still mean a decent number by any standards!,"" it added.","India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.

An employee is entitled for a 50 per cent amount of the last drawn salary as pension.OPS was discontinued by the NDA government in 2003 with effect from April 1, 2004.Under the new pension scheme (NPS), employees contribute 10 per cent of their basic salary towards pension while the government contributes 14 per cent.Governments of Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand have informed the central government/ Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA about their decision to restart OPS for their employees.The government of Punjab on November 18, 2022, issued a notification regarding implementation of OPS for the state government employees who are being covered under NPS. Jharkhand too has decided to revert to OPS.",Former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan has expressed his concern over the decision of some states to restart the old pension scheme.

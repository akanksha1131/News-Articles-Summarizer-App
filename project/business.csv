Flexibility in Tax Regime Selection for Salary TDS

Income Tax Filing FY 2024-25 : Employers are currently requesting salaried employees to provide documentation of tax-saving investments and expenses if they wish to reduce their tax liability. These documents are essential to prevent complete tax deduction at source (TDS) from the salary.Most employees typically have until March to provide tax-saving documentation, however it is beneficial to submit them promptly. Until documentation is provided, employers will deduct the full tax amount from salary without considering any tax-saving investments. Tax specialists indicate that not every employee needs to submit investment documentation.Regarding who must provide investment proof to avoid complete salary taxation, Prakash Hegde, a practising Chartered Accountant, told ET, ""The employees who have opted for the old tax regime are required to submit investment proofs to their employers to claim exemptions and deductions via their employer. The employees who have opted for the new tax regime need not have to submit any proof for exemption and deductions as most of them are not available in the new tax regime.""The Income Tax Act, 1961's old tax regime provides various tax exemptions and deductions that individuals can claim to decrease their gross taxable income.

Our dependence on H-1B visa is limited: TCS chief,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/our-dependence-on-h-1b-visa-is-limited-tcs-chief/articleshow/117180527.cms,"File photo

TCS is one of the largest beneficiaries of H-1B visas. With Trump returning, do you think 'nearshore' will gain momentum?

There are structural shifts in the industry... Companies are achieving

productivity gains

without adding headcount..

TCS's performance was affected by seasonality and a softer discretionary and demand environment..

BENGALURU: TCS's sequential lacklustre performance can be attributed to deferral of discretionary spends by clients and seasonal effect, CEO K Krithivasan said. He, however, remains optimistic about the prospects for 2025, surpassing the previous year's performance. He spoke to TOI about H-1B visa matters and the company's business outlook. Excerpts.On an annual basis, we get between 3,000 and 4,000 H-1B visas for a workforce of, say, 600,000. That's a very small number. Even within the US, more than 50% of the workforce is locally hired. In fact, on an incremental hiring basis, we probably hire much more than 50% every year in the US compared to the H-1B workforce. So, our dependence on H-1B is quite limited. Whether it's offshore, nearshore, or onsite, all of them have a particular role to play. Nearshore exists because we sometimes want to provide the same-time zone service to our customers. We are very bullish on our nearshore operations . For instance, we do a lot of work in Mexico for North America. That's a thriving business and it's growing very well. We are confident of managing potential changes in immigration regulations.New technologies can bring about greater productivity. AI is a disruptive change in software engineering. Even in the last 10 or 15 years, productivity improved constantly due to new tools and accelerators. This technology shift is a continuation in productivity, and there will be significant improvements in certain kinds of jobs. It is going to create new kinds of roles that did not exist before. From a TCS perspective, we are leading customers in adopting the change both from a software engineering perspective and in terms of how we leverage this technology. Within TCS, we already trained more than 500,000 associates in understanding GenAI and deploying it for our customers.We did call out in Q3 (Dec quarter) the continuing headwind around the deferral of discretionary spend, or that uncertainty continued. Second, another headwind was the seasonal weakness of Q3 itself, and that resulted in us having a sequential negative growth in multiple geographies.But going forward in Q4, based on the client discussions we are having and the order book, it gives us confidence that multiple geographies will get into the growth path in the medium term.","TCS's performance was affected by seasonality and a softer discretionary and demand environment.

Cabin retrofit: Air India bets on premium seats,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/cabin-retrofit-air-india-bets-on-premium-seats/articleshow/117185564.cms,"File photo

NEW DELHI: Air India will nearly double the premium cabins on its legacy wide body aircraft that are being sent for retrofitting, starting this year, and is also developing an all-new first class for the Maharaja's flagship Airbus A350 that will be rolled out in the next 2-3 years. Given the post Covid trend of premiumisation, the airline has seen its front-end revenue grow by 2.3 times after being taken over by the Tatas in Jan 2022 - compared to 1.6 times in economy, according to AI chief commercial officer (CCO) Nipun Aggarwal.Instrumental in AI's record firm order for 570 aircraft placed since Feb 2023, Aggarwal said: ""Pre-AI takeover, Tata Group's presence in aviation was sub-optimal. The market share of our JVs, erstwhile Vistara and AirAsia India, was in low single digits with a combined fleet of 70 aircraft. AI was once in a lifetime opportunity for us to scale up the business and become viable.""""We have added 92 aircraft since the takeover and many grounded (planes of AI) are flying again. Vistara reached a fleet of 70 aircraft in under a decade. The combined fleet of full service AI (Vistara merged into it) and budget AI Express (AirAsia India merged into it) is now at 300. Revenue has grown over 10 times from $1 million in FY20; routes and flights have already more than doubled. There is a meaningful and material aircraft order for the group now,"" he added.With India being the fastest growing aviation market globally and foreign airlines accounting for almost 80% of the long-haul traffic via their hubs abroad, AI is working to strengthen its hubs in Delhi, Mumbai and Bengaluru with AI Express working in tandem to provide the feed for wide bodies going to distant corners of the globe. By the end of next calendar year, AI and AI Express will have about 120 narrow-body planes each and the three hubs acting as the hub-and-spokes for transfer traffic.""A huge traffic overflies India between the west and the east & Australia via the hubs near us. Through connecting flight timings, we will increase our share in all these areas including international-to-international transfers which will be doubled in three years,"" Aggarwal said.While the entire narrow body fleet will be retrofitted this calendar year, the wide body programme will begin this year with the legacy Boeing 787s and in 2026 the B777s will see their much-awaited cabin upgrade.On the falling rupee, Aggarwal said: ""That puts pressure on our profitability and cost structure with most expenses being incurred in dollar. AI has some hedge as we fly international more than others. We charge in forex and are able to pass on the impact for about half the ticket sales that happens abroad.""Will the falling rupee mean higher fares? ""Demand is price sensitive. Raising fares impacts traffic and so we have to strike a balance. If airlines had that kind of pricing power, the industry profitability would not be like it is.""",Air India will nearly double the premium cabins on its legacy wide body aircraft.

Brands off to Kumbh amid demand slump,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/brands-off-to-kumbh-amid-demand-slump/articleshow/117180169.cms,"Photo/Agencies

MUMBAI: As scores of people gear up to visit the Maha Kumbh mela at Prayagraj, brands are going all out on advertising and marketing to gain a share of consumers' mind space.At a time when consumption is sluggish and the Indian middle class is counting every penny they are spending, getting 40 crore people - that's the estimated number of visitors expected to turn up at the religious congregation held once in every 12 years - to potentially sample and be introduced to their products is an opportunity brands cannot afford to overlook. From FMCG companies to banks and startups, companies have lined up promotional activities to market their brands and showcase new launches.Brands are estimated to spend about Rs 3,600 crore on advertising and marketing around Maha Kumbh, about 25% of which will be allocated for outdoor advertising , business and brand strategy specialist Harish Bijoor told TOI. Events like Maha Kumbh allow brands to cash in on moment marketing - the visibility becomes manifold and most brands use this as an opportunity to showcase their innovation, said Sandeep Goyal, chairman at Rediffusion. Besides, Maha Kumbh can act as a good testing ground for brands - they can gauge consumer feedback for new products they plan to push to wider markets and strategise accordingly. ""Such events allow brands to do test marketing which otherwise can be difficult,"" said Goyal.FMCG firms like Dabur, Reliance Consumer Products, PepsiCo, Coca-Cola and ITC are betting big on Maha Kumbh to grab more eyeballs for their products amid a slowdown in broader industry sales. Some have installed big hoardings of their brands, some have set up product booths with most ramping up production to ensure adequate supply of products. Dabur has tied up with dhabas and eateries in the city and on the highways to get consumers to sample its digestive brands like Hajmola. The company is spending on brand activations-for instance, it is setting up changing rooms for women devotees at ghats, baby care rooms which will be branded with its hair care and baby care brands. ""Standing out in a crowded environment requires creativity and innovation. While the space may seem cluttered, it offers companies the opportunity to get consumers to touch, feel and experience their brands and build greater connect. This will generate sales in the days to come,"" said Mohit Malhotra, CEO at DaburIndia.Reliance Consumer Products, which has been sharpening its focus on the beverage portfolio is heavily advertising its brand Campa. It has set up a resting zone for pilgrims at the mela and branded it as Campa Ashram. The firm will also leverage the reach of Kumbh to market staples and snacks offered by its brand Independence. ITC will go local-it will serve consumers regional food that will be fused with products from its brand Bingo! Coca-Cola has adopted a somewhat similar strategy. ""We will be pairing our diverse portfolio of beverages with local foods and flavours bringing to life immersive experiences,"" said Greishma Singh, VP, marketing at Coca-Cola India and southwest Asia. PepsiCo's energy drink Sting has set up mobile charging towers for devotees besides branding auto rickshaws. ""Brands have always wanted to be where people are. It is the typical large CPG (consumer packaged goods) brands which have taken a first heads up opportunity in places like this. The outlay for such events is not yet as large as traditional media,"" said Kushal Sanghvi, chief revenue officer at iCubesWire.Every brand wants to capitalise on an event of a scale of that of Kumbh.

The pressure on the rupee is likely to persist in the near term as uncertainty over US rates and government policies is expected to keep the dollar strong,"" said Aditi Gupta, economist at Bank of Baroda, in a report she co-authored.While RBI has been intervening in the forex market by selling dollars in the spot and forward markets (see graphic), the collateral damage has been the draining of liquidity, resulting in an increase in overnight interest rates.US Treasuries plunged on Friday after data showed the labour market grew in Dec, sending the 30-year bond yield above 5 per cent for the first time in more than a year. This added to the recent selloff in global bonds as investors grow anxious over lingering inflation and widening fiscal deficits, including in the US, as President-elect Donald Trump returns to the White House.According to a Stanchart report co-authored by Anubhuti Sahay, the timeline for a 50 basis points repo rate cut has been revised to April-June from February-April due to tight rupee liquidity conditions.Stanchart expects a 50 basis points cash reserve ratio (CRR) cut at the Feb MPC meeting, citing expectations of a further widening in the liquidity deficit. Estimates suggest that the headline liquidity deficit could increase to Rs 1.9-2.5 lakh crore by the end of FY25 if left unaddressed.The report also lowers its dollar-rupee forecast by 175 paise to 86.25 by March 2025, attributing the change to RBI's increased tolerance for a stronger dollar and weaker balance of payments flows.""The magnitude of FX intervention since October has been substantial and is resulting in adverse effects, such as tighter banking liquidity and higher short-term rates at a time of weakening growth, which in turn is leading to more capital outflows and possibly dollar hoarding in anticipation of further depreciation,"" said Sonal Varma and Aurodeep Nandi of Nomura in a report. According to them, allowing some depreciation would be a prudent move.The Oct policy report said that the baseline assumptions for projections, assumed the rupee at 83.5 versus the dollar in the second half of FY25. ""If the rupee depreciates by 5 per cent over the baseline, inflation could be higher by around 35bps while GDP growth could edge up by around 25bps through short term stimulation of exports,"" RBI said.",RBI governor Sanjay Malhotra faces his first major challenge after taking office last month.

'Trump will continue fighting against these hoaxes'

The hush-money case

Trump's other federal cases

US President-elect Donald Trump will be sentenced on January 10 for his hush-money case, a New York judge ruled Friday. Judge Juan M Merchan indicated Trump would likely receive an unconditional discharge, meaning no jail time, fine, or probation.The sentencing date comes shortly before Trump's planned return to the White House on January 20. Trump can attend the sentencing virtually.The judge rejected Trump's arguments for dismissal based on presidential immunity and his upcoming second term. Merchan said concluding the case served the interests of justice, balancing Trump's ability to govern with the Supreme Court's ruling on presidential immunity, public expectations of equal application of the law, and respect for the jury's verdict. ""This court is simply not persuaded that the first factor outweighs the others at this stage of the proceeding,"" Merchan wrote.Trump's lawyers argued the case would disrupt his presidency, while prosecutors suggested options like freezing the case or a guaranteed no-jail sentence. The judge ruled Trump's status as president-elect doesn't grant him the same immunity as a sitting president, and dismissing the case would undermine the rule of law.Trump faces a maximum potential sentence of four years in prison, though that outcome is unlikely given the judge's indication. The sentencing was initially scheduled for July but has been postponed twice.Steven Cheung, Trump's communications director, said that the order issued by Acting Justice Merchan in the Manhattan DA's case, which he described as a ""witch hunt,"" was a direct violation of the Supreme Court's immunity decision and other longstanding jurisprudence. He added that the case should be dismissed.""Today's order by the deeply conflicted, Acting Justice Merchan in the Manhattan DA Witch Hunt is a direct violation of the Supreme Court's Immunity decision and other longstanding jurisprudence. This lawless case should have never been brought and the Constitution demands that it be immediately dismissed,"" Cheung said in his statement on social media platform X.Cheung stressed that Trump must be allowed to continue the presidential transition process and that there should be no sentencing.""President Trump must be allowed to continue the Presidential Transition process and to execute the vital duties of the presidency, unobstructed by the remains of this or any remnants of the Witch Hunts. There should be no sentencing, and President Trump will continue fighting against these hoaxes until they are all dead,"" Cheung added.Trump was convicted in May on 34 counts of falsifying business records related to a hush-money payment made to adult film actress Stormy Daniels during the 2016 presidential campaign. Trump denies Daniels' allegations and maintains his innocence.This conviction makes Trump the first former president convicted of a crime and the first convicted individual elected president.The case revolves around how Trump reimbursed his then-lawyer, Michael Cohen, for the payment to Daniels. Cohen called the judge’s decision “judicious and appropriate.”Trump’s legal team previously attempted to overturn the conviction based on a Supreme Court immunity decision and sought to move the case to federal court, but both efforts were unsuccessful.This case is the only one of Trump's four criminal indictments to reach trial. Two federal cases, one related to the 2020 election and the other to classified documents, have been dismissed by special counsel Jack Smith. A state election interference case in Georgia is currently on hold. Trump's lawyers argued the dismissal of the federal cases warranted dismissal of the New York hush-money case, but Judge Merchan disagreed, saying that the hush-money case was in a “vastly” different stage.","US President-elect Donald Trump will be sentenced on January 10 for his hush- money case.

The crash

South Korea: 'Real Reason' Behind Plane Crash That Killed 179 Is Finally Out? Jeju Air Probe

Crucial data is missing from the black boxes of the Jeju Air plane that crashed at Muan International Airport , claiming 179 lives, on December 29, the South Korean transport ministry said on Saturday. The flight data and voice recorders from the Boeing 737-800 stopped functioning approximately four minutes before the crash, according to the ministry.Former transport ministry accident investigator Sim Jai-dong said, ""The discovery of the missing data from the crucial final minutes was surprising and suggests all power, including backup, may have been cut, which is rare,"" according to a Reuters report.The voice recorder was initially examined in South Korea but was later sent to a US national transportation safety board laboratory when missing data was discovered, the ministry confirmed. The damaged flight data recorder was sent to the US for analysis in collaboration with the US safety regulator.""A joint investigation team comprising Korean and US officials is trying to determine what caused the devices to stop working,"" the ministry said.The ministry assured that other available data would be used in the investigation, stressing transparency and a commitment to keeping the victims' families informed. However, some family members of the victims expressed concerns, suggesting that the transport ministry should not lead the investigation. They advocated for the inclusion of independent experts, including those recommended by the families.The plane, Jeju Air flight 7C2216, was en route from Bangkok, Thailand, to Muan International Airport, South Korea, when it crashed into an embankment during an attempted landing. Approximately four minutes before the crash, the pilots reported a bird strike and declared an emergency. Air traffic control had warned of ""bird activity"" two minutes before the emergency call.The pilots attempted to abort the landing, but the plane turned sharply and crash-landed without its landing gear deployed. The crash claimed the lives of 179 of the 181 people on board.Authorities are still investigating the cause of the accident. The investigation also focuses on the embankment the plane struck, particularly why it was constructed with such rigid material and placed so close to the runway.","Flight data and voice recorders from the Boeing 737-800 stopped functioning approximately four minutes before the crash.

Wage gains



The US economy in December added the most jobs since March and the unemployment rate unexpectedly fell, capping a surprisingly strong year and supporting the case for a pause in Federal Reserve interest-rate cuts.Nonfarm payrolls increased 256,000, exceeding all but one forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists. The unemployment rate fell to 4.1%, while average hourly earnings rose 0.3% from November, a Bureau of Labor Statistics report showed Friday.Treasury yields and the dollar surged and S&P 500 futures sank following the release as traders pushed back expectations for another reduction to later in the year.Friday’s report confirms the labor market held up last year despite high borrowing costs, lingering inflation and political uncertainty. While demand for workers moderated and the unemployment rate rose in 2024, the economy still added 2.2 million jobs — below the 3 million increase in 2023 but above the 2 million created in 2019.The Fed’s focus has returned firmly to inflation following an upturn in recent months, with several officials signaling they may hold rates steady for a while after lowering borrowing costs by a full percentage point in 2024. The BLS will publish monthly data on consumer prices on Jan. 15.December’s advance in payrolls was led by health care and social assistance, retail trade and leisure and hospitality. Government payrolls also advanced. Manufacturing and wholesale trade posted declines.The participation rate — the share of the population that is working or looking for work — was unchanged at 62.5%. The rate for workers of ages 25-54, also known as prime-age workers, was also unchanged.The figures also showed fewer people permanently lost their jobs and more workers left positions voluntarily, while the median duration of unemployment ticked lower.Central bankers are paying close attention to how labor supply and demand dynamics are impacting wage gains. Friday’s report showed average hourly earnings increased 3.9% from a year ago. Earnings for nonsupervisory employees, who make up the majority of workers, advanced 0.2% from November and 3.8% from a year earlier, marking the slowest annual pace since mid-2021.The jobs report is comprised of two surveys — one of businesses and the other of households. The data incorporated annual revisions to the household survey, which is used to produce statistics like the unemployment and participation rates. Those revisions didn’t change the overall picture of the labor market. Benchmark revisions to the business survey are due next month.Though data on weekly filings for unemployment insurance suggest layoffs remained subdued in 2024, several big-name companies including BlackRock Inc. and Tyson Foods Inc. have revealed plans to reduce headcount this year. In 2024, companies announced the fewest hires in almost a decade, according to a report from executive-coaching firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas.It also remains to be seen how President-elect Donald Trump’s economic agenda — particularly plans for mass deportations and punitive tariffs on imported goods — will impact the labor market.","Nonfarm payrolls increased 256,000, exceeding all but one forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists.

"US economy likely added 153,000 jobs last month, returning to normal after strike and hurricanes",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-economy-likely-added-153000-jobs-last-month-returning-to-normal-after-strike-and-hurricanes/articleshow/117114666.cms,"WASHINGTON: Getting a clear view of the US job market hasn't been easy the past few months.Hurricanes and a big strike at Boeing threw off the October jobs numbers, pushing them down and setting up a payback rebound in November that likely exaggerated the strength of hiring.The December jobs numbers, out Friday from the Labor Department, are expected to deliver a more accurate reading of where things stand. Most economists expect them to show that hiring is solid but slowing, especially compared to the boom days of 2021-2023. Forecasters surveyed by the data firm FactSet expect that U.S. payrolls grew by 153,000 last month, compared to 227,000 in November and a mere 36,000 in strike- and hurricane-hit OctoberBoston College economist Brian Bethune is slightly more optimistic about last month's hiring. He's expecting 165,000 to 175,000 new jobs in December - a number, he says, that would be seen by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell as striking a Goldilocks balance, not hot enough to inflame worries about inflation, not cold enough to suggest the economy is sputtering. ""If we got a number in that range, he'd put his feet up on the desk and probably have a good bourbon,'' Bethune said.If the forecasters are right about December hiring, the American economy generated about 2.1 million jobs last year, not bad but down from 3 million in 2023, 4.5 million in 2022 and a record 7.2 million in 2021 as the economy roared back from COVID-19 lockdowns and massive layoffs in 2020. The unemployment rate is forecast to have remained at a low 4.2% in December.Over the past few years, the economy and the job market have shown surprising resilience. Responding to inflation that hit a four-decade high two and a half years ago, the Fed raised its benchmark interest rate - the fed funds rate -- 11 times in 2022 and 2023, taking it to the highest level in more than two decades.The higher borrowing costs were widely expected to cause a recession but didn't. Companies kept hiring, consumers kept spending, and the economy kept rolling along. In fact, U.S. gross domestic product - the nation's output of goods and services -- has expanded at a robust annual pace of 3% or more in four of the last five quarters.American workers enjoy unusual job security. Layoffs are running below the pre-pandemic trend. On Thursday, the Labor Department reported that just 211,000 people applied for unemployment benefits last week, the fewest in nearly a year.Inflation has come down, too, from a peak of 9.1% in June 2022 to 2.7% in November. The drop in year-over-year price increases gave the Fed enough confidence to cut rates three times in the last four months of 2024.But Fed officials signaled at their December meeting that they planned to be more cautious about rate cuts this year. They now project just two rate reductions in 2025, down from the four they envisioned back in September. Progress against inflation has stalled in recent months, and it remains stuck above the Fed's 2% target.Friday's job report is expected to show that average hourly wages rose 0.3% last month from November and 4% from December 2023, according to the FactSet survey. The Fed sometimes frets that wage gains will fuel inflation as companies try to pass along higher labor costs to customers by raising prices.But Nancy Vanden Houten, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, said in a commentary that current wage growth is consistent with the Fed's inflation goals. That is partly because strong gains in U.S. productivity allow companies to pay their workers more and earn fatter profits without having to raise prices. ""Earnings growth won't give the Fed any headaches,"" Vanden Houten wrote.","The December jobs numbers are expected to deliver a more accurate reading of where things stand.

However, the data suggests these initiatives have yet to significantly impact the world's second-largest economy.The whole of 2024 saw flat prices, reflecting the previous year's performance. The slowdown in spending, coupled with ongoing challenges in the property market and local government financing, has cast doubt on the feasibility of Beijing's growth targets.China emerged from a four-month deflationary period in February, following the sharpest price drop in 14 years.

McDonald's rolls back diversity practices; which other US firms have done the same?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/mcdonalds-rolls-back-diversity-practices-which-other-us-firms-have-done-the-same/articleshow/117032353.cms,"What is the DEI initiative?

Other companies scaling back DEI initiatives

Walmart

Ford

Lowe’s

John Deere

Tractor Supply

McDonald’s has announced crucial changes to its diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policies, joining a growing list of companies pulling back on such initiatives. The fast-food giant cited the US Supreme Court’s July 2023 ruling, which also banned affirmative action in college admissions, as a key factor influencing its decision.The Chicago-based burger chain will discontinue specific diversity goals for senior leadership and retire its program encouraging suppliers to adopt DEI training.Additionally, the fast food entity’s diversity team will be rebranded as the Global Inclusion Team, a shift the company says better reflects its values and business focus. Despite these changes,McDonald’s emphasised its commitment to fostering inclusion, calling a diverse workforce a “competitive advantage.”Back in 2021, McDonald's introduced a range of diversity initiatives following multiple sexual harassment lawsuits from employees and a discrimination lawsuit filed by a group of Black former franchise owners.At the time, McDonald's chairman and CEO Chris Kempczinski wrote in a LinkedIn post, ""As a world-leading brand that considers inclusion one of our core values, we will accept nothing less than real, measurable progress in our efforts to lead with empathy, treat people with dignity and respect, and seek out diverse points of view to drive better decision-making.""However, the company said that the ""shifting legal landscape"" following the Supreme Court decision and the actions of other corporations caused it to reconsider its own policies.This decision reflects a broader trend as conservative activists challenge DEI programs in corporate America, targeting workplace initiatives aimed at supporting historically marginalised groups. Critics argue such policies are unfair and advocate for equal opportunities without consideration of race, gender, or sexual orientation.The DEI (diversity, equity, and inclusion) initiative refers to a set of policies and programs aimed at promoting a more inclusive and equitable environment within organisations. These initiatives often include measures to promote diversity in leadership roles, support historically marginalised groups, and ensure fair treatment regardless of race, gender, or sexual orientation.Conservative activists have been targeting companies through legal action and social media campaigns, aiming to challenge workplace initiatives. Their focus includes diversity programs and hiring practices designed to support historically marginalised groups, as well as broader objections to initiatives centred on gender identity and sexual orientation.The world’s largest retailer had announced earlier in November that it would not renew its five-year commitment to an equity racial centre established after George Floyd’s death in 2020. It also exited the Human Rights Campaign’s LGBTQ+ workplace inclusion index and revised its supplier diversity policies, ceasing to prioritise demographic factors such as race and gender.Furthermore, Walmart pledged to monitor its third party marketplace more closely to prevent the sale of products aimed at LGBTQ+ minors, such as chest binders for transgender youth.In August, Ford’s CEO Jim Farley outlined changes to the company’s DEI policies, including withdrawing from the Human Rights Campaign’s Corporate Equality Index. Farley stated that thr company does not use hiring quotas or link compensation to diversity metrics but remains committed to fostering an inclusive workplace.“We will continue to put our effort and resources into taking care of our customers, our team, and our communities versus publicly commenting on the many polarizing issues of the day,” the memo stated.Lowe’s also reevaluated its DEI programs, consolidating employee resource groups into one organisation and stepping back from LGBTQ+ inclusion events like parades and festivals. The retailer said these adjustments were made following the Supreme Court’s affirmative action decision.Previously, the company had “individual groups representing diverse sections of our associate population.”It will cease to participate in festivals and parades that are outside of its business domain.In July, the farm equipment manufacturer announced it would no longer sponsor cultural awareness events or implement diversity quotas. John Deere also committed to auditing its training materials to ensure compliance with federal laws and to remove “socially motivated messages.”Moline, Illinois based company further added “the existence of diversity quotas and pronoun identification have never been and are not company policy.” However, it would still work to “track and advance” the diversity of the company.The rural retailer eliminated all DEI roles and goals in June after facing conservative backlash online. It also announced it would cease sponsoring Pride festivals and voting campaigns and no longer be submitting data for the HRC index.The National Black Farmers Association also called on Tractor Supply’s president and CEO to step down shortly after the company's announcement.","McDonald's has announced changes to its diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policies.

South Korea, renowned global leader in the cosmetics and plastic surgery sector, achieved a significant milestone in its K-beauty industry with exports surpassing the $10 billion mark in 2024, according to the government data released on Monday.Yonhap news agency reported that as per the ministry of food and drug safety, the total value of South Korea's cosmetic exports surged by 20.6 per cent annually, reaching an all time high of $10.2 billion.This impressive growth was credited to the Hallyu wave which amplified the global appeal of Korean cultural exports like K-pop and K-dramas.China emerged as the largest importer of South Korean cosmetics, purchasing $2.5 billion worth of products. The United States followed with $1.9 billion, while Japan ranked third with $1 billion in imports, according to the SME Times.Food minister Oh Yu-Kyoung said, ""The government will strengthen cooperation with trading partner countries to help local firms continue the growth of cosmetic exports while helping them meet safety standards in the US and China.""South Korea’s cosmetic exports have undergone consistent growth since 2014, when shipments were valued at $1.8 billion.

The bio exports reached $6.34 billion in the July-September period in 2024 $5.17 billion recorded over the corresponding period in 2023, as per the Korea health industry development institute.The bio-health product exports, including pharmaceuticals and medical instruments, were driven by strong demand for pharmaceutical goods in European nations.Pharmaceutical exports led the surge, rising by 43.5 per cent year-on-year to $2.38 billion, with significant demand from Hungary, Germany, and Belgium. Exports of medical instruments grew modestly by 1.8 per cent to $1.37 billion, driven by laser equipment sales.Cumulatively, South Korea’s bio-health exports totalled $18.5 billion for the January-September period, marking a 15.6 per cent increase from the previous year.","The total value of South Korea's cosmetic exports surged by 20.6 per cent annually, reaching an all time high of $10.2 billion.

Investors are on the lookout for the next big play, and everybody is wondering which token might rival Shiba Inu 's legendary 2021 rally. Fartcoin and Remittix are among the contenders generating buzz, each with unique features and potential. While Fartcoin has caught attention with its quirky appeal, Remittix stands out in terms of real-world utility and game-changing technology. Let’s find out why experts believe Remittix is more likely to achieve 1,000x returns. Remittix is a crypto platform that intends to revolutionize and streamline the crypto-to-fiat transaction pipeline. Remittix's PayFi protocol allows anybody with a crypto wallet to send fiat cash to any account globally, offering significantly lower fees compared to services like Western Union or MoneyGram.The magic lies in how Remittix connects local payment networks with over 40 blockchain ecosystems. The recipient doesn’t need to know the transaction came from crypto, and senders avoid foreign exchange fees entirely.This innovative approach simplifies crypto-to-fiat transactions, solving a major market need. Many experts believe Remittix could become the top choice for individuals and businesses seeking a seamless way to handle crypto and fiat payments.With blockchain technology ensuring secure, tamper-proof payment records, Remittix already earned the nickname “Ripple 2.0.” Its native token, $RTX, features a token vesting plan to maintain long-term value and stability. Token holders also enjoy staking rewards of up to 18% APY and governance rights.Currently priced at just $0.0185, $RTX offers an exciting opportunity for early investors. Industry predictions suggest it could surpass $1 by 2025, making it a potential game-changer in the DeFi space.Since its launch in October, Fartcoin has quickly gained a massive following. It reached a $1 billion market cap faster than major memecoins like Dogecoin, which took eight years to hit the same milestone. The coin even broke into mainstream culture, catching the attention of late-night host Stephen Colbert.Recently, Fartcoin hit an all-time high of $1.53 and is now trading at $1.45, reflecting a 66% increase over the past week. Its rapid rise is partly linked to its connection with Truth Terminal, an AI-driven X account that inspired the coin’s name. The project was later launched on the Solana-based meme coin platform Pump.fun.Fartcoin’s unique origins and strong momentum have positioned it as one of the most talked-about memecoins in the market today.The Shiba Inu (SHIB) team has officially announced its long-awaited TREAT token launch this January. While the exact date hasn’t been revealed, the announcement came from TREAT’s official X account, generating excitement among investors.This milestone follows years of delays and marks a breakthrough for the Shiba Inu ecosystem. In 2024, the team used $12 million from a TREAT token fundraiser to develop its Layer-3 privacy blockchain. Although a public sale was expected shortly after, no timeline was provided, leading to speculation.Shytoshi Kusama, Shiba Inu’s lead developer, emphasized that TREAT will drive the project closer to full decentralization while supporting innovation and growth. Currently trading at $0.00002432, Shiba Inu has risen 6% since January 3rd, with CoinCodex predicting a 109% price surge after the next U.S. presidential inauguration. Remittix stands out as the top contender for 1,000x gains in 2025, thanks to its real-world utility and innovative payment solution. Unlike Shiba Inu or Fartcoin, it solves a genuine problem by simplifying global crypto-to-fiat transactions.

'Unrealistic scheduling': US Transportation department slaps $2 million penalty on JetBlue Airways,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/unrealistic-scheduling-us-transportation-department-slaps-a-2-million-penalty-on-jetblue-airways/articleshow/116923380.cms,"Settlement

Chronic delays



The US transportation department has imposed a $2 million penalty on JetBlue Airways for persistent delays on its east coast routes. Half of the fine would be distributed as compensation to affected passengers. This marks the first instance of an airline being fined for chronic delays on specific routes, which the department attributed to JetBlue’s “unrealistic scheduling,” the agency said.Transportation secretary Pete Buttigieg criticised the airline, stating, “Illegal chronic flight delays make flying unreliable for travelers. Today’s action puts the entire airline industry on notice that we expect their flight schedules to reflect reality.”JetBlue, however, shifted part of the blame onto the government’s air traffic control system .Spokesperson Derek Dombrowski said the airline had invested “tens of millions of dollars to reduce flight delays” caused by air traffic control challenges in key markets, including the Northeast and Florida which led to improved on-time performance in 2024, especially during peak summer travel.Dombrowski called the incoming Trump administration to modernise outdated air traffic control systems and address staffing shortages among controllers.The department identified chronic delays on JetBlue flights between June 2022 and November 2023. Problematic routes included flights from New York’s JFK Airport to Raleigh-Durham, Fort Lauderdale, and Orlando, as well as flights from Windsor Locks, Connecticut, to Fort Lauderdale.JetBlue has since agreed to a settlement over delays on four specific routes.“While we’ve reached a settlement to resolve this matter regarding four (routes) in 2022 and 2023, we believe accountability for reliable air travel equally lies with the US government, which operates our nation’s air traffic control system,” Dombrowski revealed.Under the regulations set by the transportation department, airlines must not publish unrealistic schedules, ensuring departure and arrival times reflect operational realities. A flight is deemed chronically delayed if it operates at least 10 times a month and arrives more than 30 minutes late in over half of those instances.","The US transportation department has imposed a $2 million penalty on JetBlue Airways for persistent delays on its east coast routes.

What Bloomberg strategists are saying...

While the notable absence of a Santa Rally has previously led to a rebound in stocks for the month of January, the year’s first trading day doesn’t offer a great signal for the whole 12-month period. Over the past four years, for example, it has actually been a contrarian indicator, Deutsche Bank notes. The S&P 500 ended the year inversely of how it started.

Extending that analysis back to 1928, the year’s first trading day and the SPX’s annual performance have a poor correlation and have only moved in tandem ~50% of the time.

Tatiana Darie, MLIV Strategist, New York

Euro bludgeoned

Major US benchmarks extended a selloff for a fifth day, shaving more than a trillion dollars from share prices. A pair of deadly attacks compounded market angst, starting the first trading day of the year on a dour note.An early rally collapsed driving the Nasdaq 100 down more than 1%. The tech-heavy gauge and the S&P 500 clawed back losses to end Thursday down 0.2%. Tesla Inc.’s post-Christmas slump swelled to nearly 20% after its annual vehicle sales dropped, dragging on the indexes.Treasury yields steadied following a choppy session. The rate on the benchmark 10-year was nearly 20 basis points above the level prior to Jerome Powell’s hawkish turn at a Dec. 18 Federal Reserve meeting. Big moves have proliferated across asset classes after Powell’s board expressed waning enthusiasm for interest-rate cuts. The Cboe Volatility Index climbed for the fourth time in five days.Tesla sagged after the electronic vehicle-marker’s fourth-quarter deliveries missed estimates and annual sales dropped for the first time in over a decade. The stock registered its worst five-day drop in more than two years.For corporate earnings, 2025 will be a “show-me year,” according to Lisa Shalett at Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, who warned that the dominance of the Magnificent Seven — the big technology stocks responsible for the bulk of last year’s gains — was teetering. “This idea that they as a group can trade together and lead the market may falter in 2025,” she said. It’s a call echoed by others on Wall Street , including Bank of America Corp.’s Savita Subramanian.As for the grim slide in the final days of 2024, it’s “too soon to call it a bad omen,” Shalett told Bloomberg Television.Treasuries erased gains after a reading of weekly jobless claims fell to an eight-month low. A Bloomberg gauge of the dollar’s strength traded at a more than two-year peak.Goldman Sachs economists led by Jan Hatzius noted that “seasonal adjustment challenges can make jobless claims readings particularly volatile around the holiday season.”US stocks had been straining to snap a losing streak that took some shine off the S&P 500’s best two-year run dating back to the late 1990s. The index has surged more than 50% since the start of 2023, driven by gains in the tech megacaps amid enthusiasm about the boost to profits from artificial intelligence.An attack on revelers celebrating New Year’s in New Orleans thrust US domestic security back into the spotlight less than a month before Donald Trump is sworn in as president. The Federal Bureau of Investigation is probing that incident as well as the deadly explosion of a Tesla Cybertruck outside of Trump’s hotel in Las Vegas.A shooting overnight at a nightclub in New York City only added to the anxiety, while authorities said it wasn’t related to terrorism.CBOE’s gauge of Wall Street stock sentiment, the VIX, touched 19. Readings above 20 indicate mounting concern over near-term volatility.On Friday, investors will be watching the House speaker vote to see if Mike Johnson will retain his position. GOP squabbling over his reelection could bode ill for the president-elect’s agenda, according to Tom Essaye, founder of the Sevens report.If Johnson’s confirmation takes several rounds of voting over several days, “that will be a bad sign for Republican unity and hopes for quick action on pro-growth policies will take a hit,” he wrote.In the months to come, the growth outlook in Europe and China, the Federal Reserve’s policy path and Trump’s ability to execute on his campaign promises will be among the most pressing items on traders’ radars.European energy shares outperformed after a sharp increase in natural gas prices as the region braced for freezing winter temperatures without Russian supplies delivered via Ukraine. A transit contract between the two warring nations expired on New Year’s Day, with no alternative in place.The euro fell to the weakest against the dollar in over two years reflecting concerns about European growth, US trade tariffs and monetary policy divergence with the US. Many strategists are forecasting a slide to parity with the dollar or even lower this year.Euro Hits Weakest Level Versus US Dollar in Over Two YearsIn Asia, sentiment was subdued, with Chinese equities the worst performers as data pointed to a slowing economy and traders looked ahead to potentially higher tariffs.

Tussle with rival companies

Divided outlook

For the first time in at least nine years, Tesla's global annual sales have recorded a decline, dropping by 1.1 per cent compared to 2023. The electric vehicle (EV) giant delivered 1.79 million vehicles in 2024, a slight decrease from the 1.81 million sold the previous year.A 2.3 per cent hike in fourth-quarter sales, reaching 495,570 vehicles, was insufficient to offset a sluggish start to the year, despite incentives like 0 per cent financing, free charging, and affordable lease options.This decline is primarily attributed to waning demand for electric vehicles in the US and other markets. Analysts suggest that many early adopters have already purchased EVs, while mainstream buyers remain cautious about factors such as driving range, price, and access to charging stations for longer trips.Tesla’s fourth-quarter sales also fell short of Wall Street estimates, with analysts expecting 498,000 deliveries. Production figures revealed similar challenges, with 459,445 vehicles produced in the quarter and 1.77 million for the year, both falling slightly below the year's total deliveries.Adding to Tesla's concerns, the average sales price of its vehicles is estimated to have dropped to just over $41,000 in the fourth quarter, the lowest in at least four years, according to analysts polled by FactSet. This pricing pressure, coupled with once-unheard-of discounts, has weighed on Tesla’s industry-leading profit margins.The dip in sales challenges Tesla’s 2022 prediction of 50 per cent annual growth, as the company faces an ageing model lineup and increased competition from legacy automakers and startups in China, Europe, and the US. Nearly all of Tesla's sales came from its smaller, more affordable Models 3 and Y, with just 23,640 deliveries of its higher-end Model X, Model S, and the new Cybertruck.Meanwhile, Chinese rival BYD is closing in on Tesla’s lead as the world’s top EV seller, reporting a 41 per cent increase in sales to 1.77 million EVs in 2024. Tesla narrowly maintained its edge, but the competition underscores the mounting pressure on the Austin, Texas-based company.Tesla shares dropped nearly 7 per cent on Thursday following the announcement. However, the stock remains up more than 50 per cent over the past year, driven partly by optimism surrounding Tesla’s advancements in AI-powered autonomous driving technology and the prospect of regulatory easing under Donald Trump's re-election.Industry analysts remain divided on Tesla’s outlook. Daniel Ives of Wedbush remains bullish, ""We have never viewed Tesla simply as a car company...instead we have always viewed Musk and Tesla as a leading disruptive technology global player,"" he said in a report, adding, ""and the first part of this grand strategic vision has taken shape.""William Stein, an analyst at Truist Securities, told news agency AP, that Tesla will struggle to sell vehicles in future months and expects further discounting used to boost sales will weigh on its financial results.Tesla’s fourth-quarter earnings report, scheduled for 29 January, will be closely watched by investors and analysts seeking clarity on how the company plans to navigate intensifying competition and demand challenges in the evolving EV market.","Tesla delivered 1.79 million vehicles in 2024, a slight decrease from the 1.81 million sold the previous year.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume.While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

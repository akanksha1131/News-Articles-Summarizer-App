Silver prices soared to a record high on the Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX) on Friday as the December 2025 futures contract climbed to Rs 1,70,415 per kilogram. This marks an increase of Rs 1,977 or 1.18% for the day.The surge in silver prices has resulted in a remarkable 19.8% gain for the month of October, rising from a closing price of Rs 1,42,145 on September 30. This significant monthly increase highlights strong festive demand and growing industrial interest in the metal.The recent rally has sparked renewed interest in silver's long-term potential, with analysts attributing the uptrend to solid underlying fundamentals. Mahendra Patil, Founder and Managing Partner at MP Financial Advisory Services LLP (MPFASL), noted that silver is experiencing ""a phase of structural endurance rather than speculative exuberance"", as quoted by Economic Times.Patil pointed out that while silver has historically been volatile, its past performance offers valuable insights. The metal previously approached the $50 per ounce mark in 1980 and 2011, and with 2025 marking its third such approach, the focus is now on whether it can maintain sustained momentum.In 2025, silver prices surged from $29 to over $47 per ounce, reaching ""its highest level in more than a decade."" MPFASL attributes this momentum to several factors, including ""higher expectations from US rate cuts, sustained central-bank buying, and industrial restocking across solar and electronics supply chains.""Highlighting silver's dual appeal, Patil said, ""Silver is gaining ground as both a symbolic and practical substitute. Beyond its decorative appeal, the industrial demand linked to solar panels, electronics, and electric mobility provides fundamental support to prices, creating a dual-use demand base that gold lacks.""The rise in silver demand is not limited to global markets. In India, silver imports have increased significantly. ""Silver imports have expanded, reflecting its growing relevance as an industrial and investment metal within the renewable-energy and electronics value chains,"" MPFASL reported.Data from the firm also revealed that silver delivered an annualized return of 32.92% in the CY2023–CY2025 period, with a volatility of 24.66%, based on historical performance. The correlation between gold and silver during this period stood at 0.95, indicating closely linked price movements, although silver's trajectory has increasingly been driven by industrial factors.Looking ahead, MPFASL suggests that silver may continue to benefit from its industrial underpinnings. ""Silver exceeded expectations, crossing $47 per ounce on renewed industrial restocking in solar and electronics,"" the report noted.Most projections indicate that silver is expected to remain in the $44–50 per ounce range through FY2026. While gold may experience consolidation, ""silver amplified the momentum as the cyclical bellwether of a broader industrial revival.""As India enters the festive season and global industrial restocking continues, the metal's trajectory will likely depend on sustained demand from the electronics and renewable sectors. MPFASL adds that silver's ability to surpass the $50 per ounce mark may depend on whether it can ""finally build sustained momentum and move toward the next big landmark, its metaphorical 'century.'""For domestic traders, Rs 1,70,415 now serves as a key resistance level on MCX. With industrial and festive tailwinds in play, attention will remain on whether silver can build upon this rally or consolidate near its current highs.","Silver prices soared to a record high on the Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX) on Friday.

Political standoff hardens





The federal government shutdown in the United States is moving closer to becoming the second longest in history, with no signs of a breakthrough. Some lawmakers have even warned that it could soon surpass the record 35-day shutdown that took place during US President Donald Trump’s first term.The standoff began on October 1.The Trump administration is using the shutdown to advance its priorities and cut funding for programmes it opposes, while Democrats insist that any funding deal must include support for millions of Americans who risk losing health insurance or facing steep premium increases if Congress fails to act.Here's how it has affected workers, economy and government services:As of March 31, the federal government employed around 2.3 million civilian workers. Each day, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates, about 750,000 of them are furloughed, forced to stay home without pay until the shutdown ends.Others are considered “excepted” and continue working in essential services.Both groups will eventually be paid retroactively, but many could miss a full paycheck later this month after already receiving only a partial one for late September.Active-duty military personnel, roughly 1.3 million people, narrowly avoided missing their pay on Wednesday, after Trump ordered the Pentagon to redirect funds, according to AP.However, officials say another temporary fix is unlikely.The CBO estimates that paying furloughed workers who are not working is costing the government about $400 million a day.In a break from how previous administrations have handled shutdowns, the current Republican administration is moving to lay off thousands of federal employees in departments it considers low priority. A first round of job cuts affecting 4,100 workers has already been announced, with the biggest reductions at the Treasury, Health and Human Services, Education, and Housing and Urban Development departments.White House budget chief Russ Vought told “The Charlie Kirk Show” that more layoffs are coming.“I think we’ll probably end up being north of 10,000,” Vought said, as quoted by AP.“We want to be very aggressive where we can be in shuttering the bureaucracy,” he added. “Not just the funding, but the bureaucracy, that we now have an opportunity to do that.”Lawmakers admit many federal employees live paycheck to paycheck. Food banks in some communities have increased support, with the Capital Area Food Bank announcing extra food distributions in the Washington region from Monday to help federal workers and contractors.Economists warn that the longer the shutdown continues, the greater the economic fallout. Oxford Economics estimates that each week of the shutdown cuts US economic growth by 0.1 to 0.2 percentage points. A full-quarter shutdown, which has never happened before, could reduce growth by 1.2 to 2.4 percentage points.Tourism is among the worst-hit sectors. The US Travel Association expects losses of around $1 billion a week as visitors cancel trips to national parks, historical landmarks and Washington DC Many public sites, including Smithsonian museums and the National Zoo, remain shut for visitors.Air travel is feeling the strain as well. The Federal Aviation Administration has reported shortages of air traffic controllers in cities including Boston, Philadelphia, Atlanta and Houston. Flight delays have spread to airports in Nashville, Dallas, Newark and other locations.Small businesses are also affected. The US Chamber of Commerce expects the Small Business Administration normally backs around $860 million in loans for about 1,600 small firms each week, but new loans have stopped. The shutdown has also delayed mortgage approvals and property transactions by freezing the issue and renewal of flood insurance policies.Neither side appears willing to compromise. Historically, the party that ties funding bills to demands rarely gets its way, as Republicans experienced in 2013 and 2018.Public opinion is divided. A poll by The Associated Press–NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that six in ten US adults blame Trump and congressional Republicans “a great deal” or “quite a bit” for the shutdown, while 54% also hold Democrats responsible.The administration has frozen about $18 billion for a new rail tunnel under the Hudson River and an extension of New York City’s Second Avenue subway. It also cancelled $7.6 billion in clean energy grants across 16 states that backed Democrat Kamala Harris in the last presidential election. Officials say these moves are unrelated to the shutdown.Negotiations remain stuck. Republicans want health care talks to happen only after the government fully reopens. “We’re not conducting negotiations in a hostage situation,” said Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-SD.House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York said Democrats “are not going to bend and we’re not going to break because we are standing up for the American people.”","The federal government shutdown in the United States is moving closer to becoming the second longest in history.

The dilemma on festival dates

Muhurat Trading 2025: A blend of tradition and finance



Remaining stock market holidays for the year





As Diwali approaches, many are uncertain whether the festival falls on October 20 or 21 this year. As for stock markets, investors would also like to know definitive dates of the days when trading will not happen. They have a definitive date to note: the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) and National Stock Exchange (NSE) will be closed on Tuesday, October 21, for Diwali Lakshmi Puja, and again on Wednesday, October 22, for Balipratipada.However, on October 21, a special trading activity will occur which is the traditional Muhurat Trading session, a symbolic ritual lasting one hour, from 1:45 PM to 2:45 PM. This session will allow trading across various segments, including equities, futures and options, currency and commodity derivatives, and securities lending and borrowing (SLB), with modifications permitted until 2:55 PM.The confusion arises because the lunar calendar's Amavasya tithi, or new moon phase, technically extends into October 21. However, the auspicious time for Lakshmi Puja is on the evening of October 20, leading most households to celebrate then. The following day marks the start of the new Hindu Samvat year, celebrated with the Muhurat Trading session on Dalal Street.This year, the Muhurat session will occur in the afternoon on October 21, a departure from recent years when it was held in the evening.Additionally, markets are closed on October 18 for Dhanteras and October 19 for the regular weekend schedule.Muhurat Trading, meaning ""auspicious hour,"" is more than just a market event. It symbolizes the beginning of Samvat 2082, the new Hindu financial year. For investors, it represents optimism and a prayer for prosperity rather than a focus on profits.This tradition has persisted for decades, often bringing positive returns. The Sensex has closed higher in 14 of the past 18 Muhurat sessions. Even during the 2008 global financial crisis, the index rose by 5.86% during the session. In 2024, it gained 335 points, or 0.42%, continuing the trend of festive cheer.Analysts, as quoted by ET, point out that trading volumes are typically low during this one-hour window, leading to potential volatility. However, the session is not seen as a typical trading day but rather a symbolic reset, where traders, families, and brokers come together to mark a hopeful start to the new year.After October 22, only two more holidays remain for stock markets part from the regular Saturdays and Sundays. Markets will be shut on November 5 for Prakash Gurpurb Sri Guru Nanak Dev and December 25 for Christmas"," Bombay Stock Exchange and National Stock Exchange will be closed on Tuesday, October 21, for Diwali Lakshmi Puja, and again on Wednesday, October 22, for Balipratipada.

'Fantastic deal or 155% tariffs': Trump sets tone ahead of Xi meet on US-China trade talks,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/fantastic-deal-or-155-tariffs-trump-sets-tone-ahead-of-xi-meet-on-us-china-trade-talks-watch/articleshow/124710580.cms,"US Infiltrates China’s Time Centre, Steals Secrets | Beijing Drops Bombshell Amid Trump’s Trade War





US President Donald Trump on Monday set the tone for his upcoming meeting with China's President Xi Jinping, saying the two countries would strike a “fantastic deal” — and warning that failure to reach an agreement could see China face potential tariffs of 155%.“I think we’re going to end up having a fantastic deal with China. It’s going to be a great trade deal. It’s going to be fantastic for both countries, and it’s going to be fantastic for the entire world,” he said as he hosted Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese at the White House.""I think China’s been very respectful of us. They are paying tremendous amounts of money to us in the form of tariffs. As you know, they are paying 55%, that's a lot of money...A lot of countries took advantage of the US and they are not able to take advantage anymore. China’s paying 55% and a potential 155% come November 1st unless we make a deal. I am meeting with President Xi. We have a very good relationship, we are going to be meeting in South Korea in a couple of weeks. ..I think we are going to work out something which is good for both the countries,"" he added.His comments follow Beijing’s move to tighten export controls on rare earth materials, essential for smartphones, fighter jets, electric vehicles, and other technologies.Trump has emphasized tariffs as a key tool in negotiations with China, threatening a new 100% tariff in response to Beijing’s expanded export controls on rare earth products.Since returning to the White House, he has already imposed additional 30% tariffs, bringing the total on Chinese goods to around 55–57%, which he says has generated “hundreds of billions” in revenue. Trump indicated that the threat of tariffs has already earned the US “great respect” from Beijing, though Chinese officials have rejected this approach, calling high tariffs the wrong way to handle relations.Despite his tough stance on trade, Trump expressed a preference for reaching a deal, highlighting his good relationship with Chinese President Xi Jinping. He also downplayed concerns over a potential Chinese attack on Taiwan, asserting that the US military’s superiority makes such a scenario unlikely.","US President Donald Trump set the tone for his upcoming meeting with China's President Xi Jinping.

Tata trusts reappoint Venu Srinivasan as vice-chairman for life,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/tata-trusts-reappoint-venu-srinivasan-as-vice-chairman-for-life/articleshow/124710438.cms,"‘All Tata trustees serve for life’







MUMBAI: In an anticipated move, trustees of Sir Dorabji Tata Trust (SDTT) and Sir Ratan Tata Trust (SRTT) approved reappointment of trustee and vice-chairman Venu Srinivasan for life on Monday, setting aside recent differences over governance issues.The decision follows reappointment of trustee and chairman Noel Tata in Jan 2025, with no limits on his tenure. SDTT and SRTT have a combined 52% stake in Tata Sons.Fellow trustee Mehli Mistry’s reappointment is similarly scheduled in the next few days. Srinivasan’s reappointment was not unexpected: the Trusts had unanimously passed a resolution on Oct 17, 2024, stating that “on expiry of tenure of any trustee, that trustee will be reappointed by the concerned Trust without any limit being attached to the period of tenure of such reappointment.”At the Oct 17, 2024 meeting, it was decided that any trustee who voted against another trustee’s reappointment would be in breach of their commitment and unfit to serve on the charities’ boards. This meant all trustees at SDTT and SRTT serve for life.At the Oct 17, 2024 meeting, it was decided that the trustees were all “equally responsible” and “charged with public duty and specifically tasked by Mr Ratan N Tata”. This resolution thus makes a trustee’s reappointment more of a formality than a serious process.Their tenures also do not have an end, similar to past trustees like JRD Tata, Ratan Tata, Jamshed Bhabha, and RK Krishna Kumar, who held their positions until their passing.While these four trustees were exceptions, others like Noshir Soonawala, who was also a trustee for life, stepped down from the boards of the two Trusts due to health and advancing age. There have also been trustees with fixed tenures, typically three years, which have been periodically renewed.Sir Dorabji Tata Trust and Sir Ratan Tata Trust are the main trusts within the Tata Trusts umbrella, collectively owning about 52% of Tata Sons. At the Oct 17, 2024 meeting, Trusts also decided that directors nominated by them to the board of Tata Sons would be reviewed on attaining 75 years of age. It was during this meeting that the charities chose to nominate Noel Tata to the Tata Sons board. Noel assumed the role of chairman of Trusts following the passing of his older half-brother Ratan Tata on Oct 9, 2024.The Trusts also specified at the Oct 17, 2024 meeting that any breach of the commitment to reappoint a trustee for life will lead to reconsideration of all resolutions passed at the same board meet. This was to ensure that trustees could not selectively follow only parts of the resolution and disregard others, said people familiar with the information. In addition to Noel Tata, Venu Srinivasan, and Mehli Mistry, the boards of the main charities include Vijay Singh, Pramit Jhaveri, Darius Khambata, and Jehangir Jehangir. The first four are part of the executive committee, which makes decisions related to Tata Sons’ shareholding and other operational matters of the Trusts.Differences among trustees became public last month following a review of nominee directors on the Tata Sons board who have reached 75 years. As a result, Vijay Singh’s directorship was reviewed, and he lost the majority of trustees’ support. Mehli was suggested as Singh’s replacement, but Noel Tata rejected the proposal. Consequently, Singh resigned from the board of Tata Sons."," trustee and vice-chairman Venu Srinivasan reappointed for life.

MUMBAI: A century-old law is holding back India’s efforts to recover bad loans . Asset reconstruction companies (ARCs) say a provision in the Indian Registration Act of 1908, which requires them to register every loan transfer with state registrars, persists despite the creation of a centralised digital alternative more than a decade ago.Each time an ARC buys a bad loan from a bank, it must record the transaction twice, once with the Central Registry of Securitisation Asset Reconstruction and Security Interest of India (CERSAI), and again with the state registration office where the property is located. The process, often involving physical paperwork across multiple districts, has become an anachronism in a digital financial system.“Govt should, in the interest of ease of doing business and faster resolution of stressed assets, accept the recommendation made by the 2011 ARC sector committee,” said Hari Hara Mishra, CEO of the Association of ARCs in India. “Assignment Agreements already recorded with CERSAI should not require further state-level registration.” The duplication, ARCs argue, inflates costs, clogs resolution process and slows down recoveries.","A century-old law is holding back India’s efforts to recover bad loans.

MUMBAI: The country’s largest and second-largest private banks, HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank , continued to be cautious in expanding their personal loan books in Q2, particularly in the unsecured segment.HDFC Bank’s retail loans rose 7.4% year-on-year and 2.2% quarter-on-quarter to Rs 15,55,400 crore, MD & CEO Sashidhar Jagdishan said in the earnings call. He emphasised that the bank will maintain its underwriting discipline, saying it “will not dilute our credit standards for underwriting” or “dilute any credit standards” to capture unsecured loan market share.On credit cards, HDFC Bank remained careful, “circumspect on increasing credit lines for revolvers”, and restricted certain spend categories, deliberately avoiding large e-commerce spends during the festive season.In home loans, the management said the bank chose “not to go down the interest rate ladder” despite competitive pricing, following its principle of not chasing market share at the cost of returns.ICICI Bank’s retail loans, which account for 52.1% of the total book, grew 6.6% year-on-year and 2.6% quarter-on-quarter to Rs 739,384 crore.Mortgages, forming 62% of retail loans, rose 9.9%, while personal loans fell 0.7%, credit card outstandings increased 6.4%, and loans against shares declined 11%. Management said the bank focuses on risk-calibrated, profitable, and sustainable growth, and that corrective actions in unsecured segments between 2020 and 2023 have strengthened portfolio performance, allowing measured disbursements. The retail portfolio, including non-fund-based loans, now represents 42.9% of the total. Sequential growth in Q2 has “picked up” across retail segments, and the bank remains “positive on the growth outlook”.","HDFC Bank’s retail loans rose 7.4% year-on-year and 2.2% quarter on quarter.

RBI: Room for rate cut as economy is resilient,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/rbi-room-for-rate-cut-as-economy-is-resilient/articleshow/124710404.cms,"



MUMBAI: Growth for the Indian economy is projected to remain resilient amid global uncertainties and the outlook for inflation has been revised downwards, opening up policy space for further supporting growth, a report by RBI said.“The Indian economy displayed resilience amid broader global uncertainty and weak external demand,” said RBI’s state of the economy report released on Monday. It noted that “global uncertainty has edged up” and that “trade tensions have started to simmer yet again”.According to the report, “the Indian economy continued to exhibit resilience amid an uncertain external environment”, with the growth outlook “remaining resilient, supported by domestic drivers, despite uncertainties on the external front”. Domestic strength remains the key support. The report said, “High-frequency indicators point to a revival in urban demand and robust rural demand”.It added that “the agricultural sector sustained its growth momentum, supported by above-normal rainfall and higher kharif sowing”, while “business confidence in manufacturing and services reached a six-month peak, reflecting higher optimism”.The central bank expects festive demand and the GST rate cut to “further boost production and enhance affordability”, aided by “adequate soil moisture and record high reservoir levels”, which “augur well for the upcoming rabi season”.Inflation has eased notably. “Headline consumer price index (CPI) inflation moderated sharply in Sept, marking its lowest reading since June 2017,” the report said, attributing this to “the deflation in food”. It noted that “core inflation edged up, reflecting the combined effect of gold price inflation as well as the significant pick-up in housing inflation”.“The current macroeconomic conditions and the outlook, as noted by the MPC, has opened up policy space for further supporting growth,” the report said.The report added, “The IMF revised upwards India’s GDP growth projections for 2025 by 20 bps to 6.6%, while the OECD revised upwards India’s GDP growth projections for 2025 by 40 bps to 6.7% and the World Bank also revised India’s growth forecast upwards to 6.5%.” The MPC “revised real GDP growth for 2025-26 upwards by 30 bps to 6.8% in the Oct 1 resolution”.It also said, “The Indian rupee depreciated against the US dollar in Sept amidst elevated trade tensions, heightened global uncertainties, and persistent foreign portfolio investment outflows.”","Growth for the Indian economy is projected to remain resilient amid global uncertainties.

While RBI’s actions cushioned Dalal Street investors, they felt jittery from the weakness of the rupee that also led some of the foreign funds to take money off the stock market.As a result, as sensex closed with a modest gain of 5.8% at 84,363 and Nifty 6.3% at 25,843, investors’ wealth, calculated by BSE ’s market capitalisation, too went up by a modest Rs 7 lakh crore to Monday’s close at Rs 455 crore, official data showed.The year also saw four billion-dollar IPOs in India — Swiggy, HDB Financial, Tata Capital and LG Electronics India — the highest number of such mega issues in a year.The volatility in the global markets, especially due to geopolitical issues and also because of the US’s overdrive relating to tariffs on imports into the world’s largest economy, had unnerved investors across the world, market players said.As a result, foreign portfolio investors net sold Indian stocks worth Rs 1.5 lakh crore, data from NSDL showed.In comparison, mutual funds were net buyers in the stock market, boosted mainly by gross monthly inflows of over Rs 25,000 crore through SIPs since Nov 2024. Till Oct 17, MFs had net bought stocks worth Rs 4.7 lakh crore, which cushioned the selling by FPIs.In the bullion space, the rally in gold and silver in the international market, combined with the weakness of the rupee, pushed the domestic prices up by about 60% for each of the precious metals. In the spot market, while gold has been hovering around Rs 1.3 lakh/10gm, silver, after scaling a high at about Rs 1.9 lakh/kg mark late last week, has cooled a bit to around Rs 1.6 lakh level.","Since last Diwali, the start of the Samvat year 2081, both the precious metals have gained nearly 60%.

MUMBAI: It has been a cracker of a Diwali for retailers this year as GST rate cuts has boosted consumption, enabling the middle class to add more items to their shopping bags this festive season. From lab-grown diamonds to casual wear and products to adorn their homes, both mass and premium segments of the market picked up.Raymonds has seen demand reviving for the mid-market segment (Rs 1,000-2,500 price points) after a sluggish Sept while Swedish retailer Ikea recorded healthy traction across mass and premium products as shoppers sought both design and value.High inflation for most part of the previous year along side stagnant wages and a subdued job market had prompted low income households to curb discretionary spending, hurting broader demand. Apart from GST cuts, govt also provided income tax relief this year to spur consumption while lower interest rates and falling inflation also helped.“The recent GST rationalisation has created positive consumer sentiment. While its primary impact was felt in categories such as electronics and automobiles, the lower tax burden has also impacted some part of our range and contributed to greater purchase consideration in home furnishings, enabling us to pass on the benefit to our customers,” Ankit Ghai, country selling manager at Ikea India told TOI.For Ikea, select portion of their portfolio has been covered under the rejigged rates. Tax on eco-friendly furniture, wholly made of bamboo, cane or rattan, has been reduced to 5% from 12%.Under the new GST regime which kicked in from Sept 22, a host of items ranging from daily essentials, budget apparel and footwear, ACs, dishwashers to small cars have become cheaper. Besides, with more savings, consumers have also been able to upgrade and splurge on premium products across categories (including those that haven’t seen tax cuts).Biba has seen a double-digit growth over last year; MD Siddharth Bindra attributed it to the brand’s innovations. It’s ‘Red’ collection, Bindra said have been “falling short of stocks”.Pooja Sheth Madhavan, founder and MD at Limelight Lab Grown Diamonds said that this year has been one of the ‘strongest’ festive seasons for the brand with sales posting a 40% growth compared to the previous Diwali season. “Consumers gravitated towards solitaire-based everyday luxury pieces, rings, pendants and earrings that blend occasion wear with daily elegance,” Madhavan said, adding that premium segment between Rs 75,000- 2 lakh performed “exceptionally well”.Casual wear sales, in particular, have been robust and formal as well as celebration wear are expected to see an uptick with weddings lined up after Diwali, said Neeraj Nagpal, chief business officer at Raymond Lifestyle Apparel & Retail Business.Amazon India claimed that it has set records this year for its annual festive sale event that saw 276 crore customer visits. Premium smartphones priced over Rs 30,000 saw a 30% year-on-year growth while lot of shoppers upgraded to large TV sets. The e-commerce space recorded a 24% year-on-year growth in order volumes while gross merchandise value (sales) posted an increase of 23%, data published by SaaS platform Unicommerce showed.In Oct 2024 (Diwali last year was on Oct 31), retail inflation stood at a 14-month high of 6.2%. Since then, inflation has reduced significantly with the latest Sept data showing an over eight-year low print of 1.5%.That said, volatility and shortage of certain commodities in global markets have had led to some price rise in India as well for items such as cocoa (steep rise earlier this year).","GST rate cuts has boosted consumption, enabling the middle class to add more items to their shopping bags.

Explained: Why Goldman Sachs is bullish on Indian banks,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/explained-why-goldman-sachs-is-bullish-on-indian-banks-all-you-need-to-know/articleshow/124707281.cms,"Representative image

Easier financial conditions to boost credit growth



Weak earnings expectations may lead to positive surprises



Profit growth expected to rebound in FY26



Valuations offer strong upside potential



External challenges remain







Global brokerage Goldman Sachs has turned optimistic on Indian banking stocks, saying improving financial conditions, low earnings expectations, and attractive valuations position the sector for a strong comeback.As per ET, the firm expects the Nifty Bank index to outperform the broader market, projecting up to 30% upside for banks and non-banking financial companies (NBFCs).Goldman Sachs expects a sharp improvement in India’s financial environment through 2025, helped by the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) 100-basis-point policy rate cuts, enhanced liquidity, and regulatory easing.These changes, according to Goldman Sachs, could reduce banks’ capital requirements by around 2 percentage points of total credit and lower funding costs.With asset quality stabilising, the firm projects that credit growth will pick up from the second half of FY26, aided further by new offshore borrowing norms expected in 2027.According to the ET report, Goldman Sachs highlights that market expectations for bank earnings are currently muted, setting the stage for potential upside.Earnings per share (EPS) for financials are expected to grow only 1% year-on-year, while banks may see a 3% decline, marking the weakest phase since the pandemic.Goldman Sachs believes this low bar raises the likelihood of positive surprises when results are announced, especially since recent EPS downgrades have been the steepest in five years.Goldman Sachs forecasts a turnaround in profitability, with sentiment towards banks now at a one-year high.The report says stabilising asset quality, early signs of consumer spending recovery, and supportive regulatory measures will drive earnings growth.Consensus estimates project financial sector profits rising 15% in FY26, compared to 8% in FY25, mainly on the back of improving loan growth and easing cost pressures.According to ET, financial stocks are trading at appealing levels after sustained foreign investor selling of about $9 billion since last year.Domestic funds also remain under-invested. Currently, the sector trades at 17 times forward earnings, or 1.1x PEG, versus MSCI India’s 1.5x, offering a favourable risk-reward ratio.Goldman Sachs expects Nifty Bank to outperform the broader Nifty index, adding that while the index has already led by 2% in the past month, it still has 10–30% upside potential relative to past peaks.Goldman Sachs also noted that financials are trading at a 22% discount to MSCI India, making current valuations particularly attractive.Despite the positive outlook, Goldman Sachs cautioned that global headwinds — such as higher US tariffs on Indian exports and rising visa costs — could affect corporate borrowing in the short term.However, it expects growth momentum to strengthen again in 2026, supported by easing fiscal consolidation, likely moderation in tariffs, and an additional repo rate cut before year-end.(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market and other asset classes given by experts are their own.

The Indian economy has demonstrated resilience despite global uncertainty and weak external demand, supported by “strong and durable macroeconomic fundamentals,” according to the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) October bulletin released on Monday.The bulletin’s article on the ‘State of the Economy’ highlighted that India’s growth momentum continues, with signs of revival in urban demand and robust rural consumption.“While the Indian economy is not immune to global headwinds, it has so far exhibited resilience, driven by a focus on strong and durable macroeconomic fundamentals, including low inflation, robust balance sheets of banks and corporates, adequate foreign exchange reserves and a credible monetary and fiscal framework,” the article said, as per news agency PTI.As per the RBI, headline consumer price index (CPI) inflation moderated sharply in September, marking its lowest reading since June 2017. However, high-frequency data up to October 17 indicated a rise in cereal prices.Among pulses, prices of gram dal, tur/arhar dal and moong dal moderated, while edible oil prices firmed up for mustard, sunflower, and palm oil. Tomato, onion and potato prices softened significantly, particularly for tomatoes.Citing the Monetary Policy Committee’s (MPC) October 1 resolution, the bulletin said the growth outlook remains resilient, driven by domestic factors despite external headwinds. “Domestic structural reforms are helping to somewhat offset the drag on growth from the weakening external demand conditions,” it added.The RBI noted that the current macroeconomic conditions have created space for policies aimed at further supporting growth.However, it cautioned that the rupee depreciated against the US dollar in September amid elevated trade tensions, global uncertainties and persistent foreign portfolio investment (FPI) outflows.As per PTI, net FPI flows remained negative for the third consecutive month due to equity outflows linked to weak investor sentiment over US tariffs and higher H-1B visa fees.The bulletin also mentioned that gross inward foreign direct investment (FDI) moderated in August, with Singapore, Cayman Islands, UAE, the Netherlands, and the US accounting for over three-fourths of total inflows.Manufacturing, computer services, construction, and financial services emerged as the top recipient sectors.However, RBI clarified that the views expressed in the bulletin are those of the authors and do not represent the official stance of the central bank.","The Indian economy has demonstrated resilience despite global uncertainty and weak external demand, according to the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) October bulletin released on Monday. headline consumer price index (CPI) inflation moderated sharply in September, marking its lowest reading since June 2017.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124707848,imgsize-793638,width-400,resizemode-4/untitled-design-26.jpg"

Dhanteras 2025:

But will this rally continue? Are gold and silver good investment bets over the next year? We ask experts what the gold and silver price outlook is and what levels will they hit by Dhanteras 2026:

Dhanteras 2025: Should you buy gold and silver this year?

What’s the gold price outlook till next Dhanteras?

Gold — Diwali/Dhanteras 2026 target: ₹1,40,000–₹1,45,000+ Bull case 160000+ if geopolitical risk escalates or Fed turns very dovish. For the 12-month horizon to Dhanteras 2026, maintaining the bullish structural view, expect upside if the macro tailwinds persist — Fed cuts, weak dollar, tariffs/ geopolitical premium.Since the price has shown sharp up move recently, its advisable to allocate in dips and parts.

Silver — Dhanteras/Diwali 2026 target: ₹1,85,000–₹2,10,000/kg; Bull case ₹2,20,000–₹2,50,000+ on stronger industrial demand Central banks buying and continued ETF flows.

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market and other asset classes given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)





Buying gold and silver is traditionally considered auspicious on Dhanteras . The precious metals have been hitting new record highs this year - with the gold rally backed by global uncertainty and diversification away from dollar and the silver bull run driven by high industrial demand and acute physical tightness in London and Comex inventories.Investors who bet on gold and silver last Dhanteras and Diwali have seen bonanza returns. According to Manav Modi, Senior Analyst, Commodity Research at Motilal Oswal Financial Services, gold and silver on the domestic front have gained by over 61% and 69% respectively from 2024 Dhanteras to till now.Manav Modi is of the view that both gold and silver could be on dips from a long term perspective as an investment. “However, one should be cautious at these levels for a dip or profit booking which could provide a better entry or purchase level,” he tells TOI.Jateen Trivedi, VP Research Analyst - Commodity and Currency, LKP Securities believes that while gold and silver are good bets, investors should not chase the peak.“For festival buying (ritual/jewellery) buy as per need; for investment, favoursystematic accumulation (SIP/laddered buys), ETFs or Sovereign Gold Bonds (SGBs) over lump-sum physical purchases at all-time highs. Silver offers higher upside potential but comes with higher volatility,” he advises.Praveen Singh, Head of Commodities, Mirae Asset ShareKhan says that both gold and silver have strong fundamentals to rise further in the coming years.“⁠Both the metals are expected to gain further on economic, political, and geopolitical uncertainties as the US Federal Reserve cuts rates into elevated inflation. De-dollarization, central banks buying gold, inflation hedge buying, long-term government bonds losing their appeal, dent in investors’ trust in US institutions, and tariff wars will continue to provide strong tailwinds for precious metals,” he tells TOI.Gold and Silver are still poised for further upside, says Manav Modi. “Overall, from a one year perspective, Gold on COMEX could target $4250 and $4500 assuming USD-INR at 89; Rs 1,28,500 and 1,35,000. Similarly, Silver could target $75 on COMEX, from a long term perspective and Rs 2,30,000 on domestic front,” he says.Praveen Singh expects gold to reach $5000 sometime around next Dhanteras, while silver is expected to rise to $60 level. “So, silver can gain 17%, while gold may gain 21% in a year. However, due to physical market tightness in London and Indian Silver markets, it is possible that silver may beat gold in the short term, though we expect that this tightness will not last long,” he says.Abhilash Koikkara, EVP & Head- Forex and Commodities, Nuvama Professional Clients Group is of the view that over the next 12 months, silver could maintain its outperformance over gold as gold offers portfolio stability and capital protection. “From a technical perspective, silver exhibits stronger bullish signals compared to gold, indicating a higher likelihood of outperforming gold by Dhanteras 2026,” he tells TOI.“Analytically, gold suits conservative wealth preservation, while silver suits risk-adjusted alpha seekers,” he adds.Trivedi notes that Gold has compounded at roughly 30.6% p.a., Silver 33% p.a., and Nifty 24% p.a. — silver has outperformed in percentage terms recently though gold remains the steadier hedge.Trivedi highlights LKP Securities’s working framework and targets (domestic, per 10 g / per kg):","Investors who bet on gold and silver last Dhanteras and Diwali have seen bonanza returns. Both the metals are expected to gain further on economic, political, and geopolitical uncertainties as the US Federal Reserve cuts rates into elevated inflation.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124665282,imgsize-56388,width-400,resizemode-4/gold-price-outlook.jpg"
Argentina-US deal: Buenos Aires formalises $20 billion currency swap pact with Washington; Javier Milei gets pre-poll boost,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/argentina-us-deal-buenos-aires-formalises-20-billion-currency-swap-pact-with-washington-javier-milei-gets-pre-poll-boost/articleshow/124707278.cms,"File photo: US President Donald Trump with Argentina's President Javier Milei (Picture credit: AP)





Argentina’s central bank on Monday formalised a $20 billion currency swap agreement with the United States in a move aimed at “contributing to Argentina’s economic stability,” the bank said in a statement.The accord, backed by the administration of US President Donald Trump , comes just days before Argentina’s mid-term elections on October 26 and is seen as crucial support for President Javier Milei, who faces mounting pressure over the country’s struggling economy.According to Bloomberg, the agreement aims to strengthen Argentina’s international reserves, preserve price stability, and promote sustainable economic growth.The deal includes specific terms and conditions to ensure bilateral financial cooperation between the two nations.The Argentine peso has been highly volatile in recent weeks, unsettling households and businesses amid fears of further depreciation.Inflation, which had briefly eased after Milei took office in December 2023, has again been climbing month-on-month, undermining confidence in his economic management, reported news agency AFP.Last week, US treasury secretary Scott Bessent also announced plans to secure an additional $20 billion facility through “private banks and sovereign wealth funds” to reinforce Argentina’s finances.Earlier, Argentina’s economy minister Luis Caputo had told a panel at the Atlantic Council that the government hoped to finalise the framework “very soon,” ideally before the midterm vote.“Hopefully we’ll very soon be able to execute the framework and agreement that will contain the terms of the swap,” Caputo said, alongside Central Bank President Santiago Bausili, according to news agency Reuters.Trump, who hosted Milei at the White House recently, tied US financial support to the outcome of the Argentine elections. “If he loses, we are not going to be generous with Argentina,” Trump warned, as quoted by AFP.His remarks sent jitters through Argentine markets, where traders interpreted the aid as politically conditional.Despite criticism from some US observers who called the swap a “bailout,” Bausili clarified that treasury secretary Bessent had confirmed the agreement was independent of any arrangements involving China.Milei, once seen as a symbol of libertarian fiscal discipline, now faces a crucial electoral test amid economic uncertainty and voter discontent.The upcoming vote is expected to determine the future of his market-driven reform agenda and Argentina’s broader financial stability.","Argentina's central bank formalises a $20 billion currency swap agreement with the United States.

Soybeans as a bargaining chip



South America steps into the breach



American harvest in limbo



(With inputs from agencies)





For the first time in seven years, China has completely halted imports of US soybeans, leaving American farmers cut off from their largest overseas customer just as the autumn harvest begins. September shipments from the US fell to zero, a sharp contrast to last year’s 1.7 million metric tons.China’s overall soybean imports remained at elevated levels, with South American shipments surging to fill the gap.In September, China purchased 12.87 million metric tons of soybeans, its second-highest monthly total on record. Brazilian shipments rose 29.9% year-on-year to 10.96 million tons, accounting for 85.2% of China’s total imports, while Argentina’s deliveries jumped 91.5% to 1.17 million tons, or 9% of the total. Analysts attribute the zero US imports primarily to Beijing’s tariffs and the depletion of previously harvested US supplies, known as old-crop beans.The soybean standoff comes amid escalating trade tensions. President Donald Trump, speaking aboard Air Force One, said he would consider reducing tariffs on Chinese goods only if Beijing resumes buying US soybeans and makes other concessions, including ending its export restrictions on rare earth minerals and halting the flow of fentanyl.“They’re paying us a lot of money in tariffs, and they’d probably like to have it be less,” Trump said. “We’ll work on that, but they have to give us some things too.” He called the halt in soybean imports an “economically hostile act” and threatened to suspend used cooking oil imports from China in response.The US recently announced a new 100% tariff on Chinese imports, bringing the total duty on some goods to a staggering 130%. “It’s no longer a one-way street,” Trump said, warning that no deal would be made unless China agreed to resume soybean purchases at previous levels.Beijing, meanwhile, appears to be leveraging soybean trade as a strategic tool. “China is looking to use the soybean trade with [the] US as a chip in future talks,” said Rosa Wang, an analyst at Shanghai-based agro-consultancy JCI, as reported by S&P Global.According to the Washington Post, Chinese officials see withholding soybean purchases as a low-cost way to exert pressure on Trump ahead of his expected meeting with President Xi Jinping at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit later this month.China’s pivot to South America has accelerated in recent months, with Brazilian soybeans dominating the market. For the January–September period, China imported 63.7 million tons from Brazil, up 2.4% year-on-year, and 2.9 million tons from Argentina, up 31.8%. Market observers note that rising Brazilian yields, competitive pricing, and counter-seasonal harvests have made it the preferred supplier amid the trade dispute.“China has become more reliant on soybeans from Brazil due to the trade disputes between the US and China,” Darin Friedrichs, co-founder of Shanghai-based Sitonia Consulting, told SCMP. “While China is working to diversify supplies, it is difficult to find sources that provide exports on the same scale as countries like Brazil or the US.”Chinese state-owned companies have also invested heavily in Brazilian ports, including Paranaguá, Açu, and Santos, ensuring steady throughput for their soybean purchases. According to the Brazilian grain exporter association ANEC, China imported 7.2 million tons from Brazil in September alone, representing 93% of Brazilian soybean exports for the month. Argentine shipments surged following a brief suspension of export taxes designed to stabilise the peso and attract dollars.The lack of US soybean imports is a major blow for American farmers, who rely on China for nearly half of their overseas soybean sales. “We’re in uncharted territory in terms of a complete absence of Chinese buyers for the harvest that is currently coming in,” Even Pay, director of agriculture research at Trivium China, told the Washington Post.Despite the zero US imports in September, Chinese buyers still hold significant outstanding demand for soybeans in December and January. Some analysts predict a potential window for US exports later in the season, as South American supplies are gradually consumed. Jack Larimer, principal crops analyst at S&P Global Commodity Insights, said China may start purchasing US soybeans in January, with shipments potentially reaching 8.5 million metric tons for the marketing year 2025–26.For Beijing, halting US soybean imports has been a relatively low-cost strategy to pressure Washington while securing alternative supplies. Analysts suggest that the move not only protects Chinese stockpiles but also provides leverage in broader trade negotiations. “China’s in a pretty good position. We really want to resolve this. They don’t need to,” said Phil Luck, director of the economics program at CSIS. .With negotiations between Chinese Vice-Premier He Lifeng and US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent planned for later this month, the outcome of soybean purchases remains a key bargaining chip in the ongoing trade war. For now, US farmers face an uncertain harvest season as China continues to rely heavily on Brazil and Argentina for its soybean supply.","US soybean imports from China fall to zero for the first time in seven years.

EU gas imports: Bloc to phase out Russian energy by 2027; aims for full independence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/eu-gas-imports-bloc-to-phase-out-russian-energy-by-2027-aims-for-full-independence/articleshow/124705305.cms,"Representative image

EU Suffers MASSIVE Energy Shock, Loses €1.3 Trillion After Ditching Russian Gas, Putin Aide Claims





The European Union has agreed to phase out its remaining gas imports from Russia by the end of 2027, a move aimed at ending its long-standing energy dependence on Moscow.The decision was taken by EU energy ministers during a meeting in Luxembourg on Monday, who approved a plan by the European Commission to gradually eliminate both pipeline and liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports from Russia, subject to approval by the European Parliament.Denmark’s energy minister Lars Aagaard, whose country currently holds the EU presidency, described the plan as a “crucial” step toward making Europe energy independent, according to news agency AFP.The phased ban will prohibit Russian gas under new contracts from January 1, 2026, with a transition period for existing agreements.Short-term contracts will be allowed until June 17 next year, while long-term deals can continue until January 1, 2028.Most EU countries supported the plan, but Hungary and Slovakia, landlocked nations still reliant on Russian pipeline gas, opposed it.As per AFP, Budapest’s top diplomat Peter Szijjarto warned, “The real impact of this regulation is that our safe supply of energy in Hungary is going to be killed”.Spain, which had initially raised legal concerns, said it would back the deal, acknowledging the risks of dependence on a single external supplier, reported Bloomberg.The EU is pursuing a two-pronged strategy, part of its RepowerEU initiative, to end reliance on Russian energy following Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022.Alongside the gradual ban on pipeline gas, the Commission has proposed phasing out Russian LNG by January 2027.EU officials will now negotiate with the European Parliament, which has called for a faster exit from Russian gas and a halt to oil imports starting next year, aiming for a final deal before the end of 2025, according to Bloomberg.Russian gas still accounts for around 13 per cent of EU imports in 2025, valued at over €15 billion annually.The EU’s energy commissioner Dan Jorgensen highlighted the broader significance of the move, “This is not just for the present conflict. It’s for the future. Never again should we make this mistake”.The decision also aligns with broader transatlantic energy cooperation, with the US-EU joint statement pledging $750 billion in energy deals over the next three years, encouraging Europe to source more LNG from the US and reduce dependence on Russian fuel.","The European Union has agreed to phase out its remaining gas imports from Russia by the end of 2027.

China’s top leaders, including President Xi Jinping, are meeting on Monday for one of the country’s most important political gatherings, the fourth plenum of the Communist Party. The meeting will last four days and finalise the five-year plan for 2026–2030, which will guide China’s economic and technological policies.Timing of the gathering is crucial as it comes amid rising trade tensions with the US and ahead of a potential Xi-Trump meeting at a regional summit later this month.The fourth plenum is the fourth of seven central committee meetings during the party’s five-year term. Around 370 members of the committee are expected to attend. Since the meeting is closed to the public, any personnel changes or key decisions may only be announced days or weeks later.These meetings aim to unite officials and the public behind the party’s priorities. The full five-year plan and details are expected at the National People’s Congress in March.Lynn Song, chief economist for Greater China at ING Bank, said that there is little reason to expect a radical shift from the format and messaging style of previous five-year plans.China’s economy, according to the World Bank, is expected to grow 4.8% this year, close to the official target of 5%, though growth slowed to 4.8% in July–September, the lowest pace in a year.Key challenges include the US trade war, slowing domestic demand, and the property market downturn, which has reduced consumer confidence.A key question is whether China’s leaders will make real changes to encourage people to spend more, said Leah Fahy, a China economist at Capital Economics. So far, the government has taken small steps, including higher child care subsidies, consumer loans, and trade-in programmes for appliances and electric vehicles.Overcapacity in many Chinese industries has led to fierce competition, such as price wars in the auto sector. At the same time, Chinese exports to regions like Southeast Asia and Africa have increased, creating more tension with the U.S. and other trading partners.Xi Jinping is also expected to highlight China’s push to become the global leader in many technologies, including artificial intelligence. At the same time, the country’s pursuit of technological “self-sufficiency,” reducing its industries’ reliance on advanced computer chips from the US has accelerated as Trump tightens American export control measures and raises tariffs. This effort, Ning Zhang, a senior China economist at UBS, said, could result in more spending on advanced technology.Since the COVID-19 pandemic, China has struggled to reignite faster economic growth. The property sector downturn has worsened the situation, causing massive layoffs and prompting families to cut back on spending as house prices fall. Wendy Leutert, professor of economics and trade at Indiana University, noted that China is still spending too little on areas that could balance the economy, such as health care, education, and child and elder care.“Overall, China’s leaders still appear willing to accept economic costs, including resource misallocation and failures, in order to pursue self-sufficiency and technological leadership in strategically important industries and strengthen overall national power.”China is facing rising friction with the US and other trading partners while also dealing with demographic pressures: the population of 1.4 billion is shrinking and ageing, and youth unemployment (16–24 years) is nearly 19%, limiting their economic contribution.The Chinese leadership has set a goal of doubling the size of the economy from 2020 by 2035. Ning Zhang of UBS said, “Like any other government, China still cares (about) growth and is still trying to get richer.”He added that maintaining 4–5% growth over the next decade will be challenging, but achieving this is crucial to demonstrate the party’s ability to deliver a better quality of life, which underpins its legitimacy.“For China’s leadership, what do they care about? Stability, legitimacy, and also ongoing support.”","The fourth plenum is the fourth of seven central committee meetings during the party’s five-year term. Since the meeting is closed to the public, any personnel changes or key decisions may only be announced days or weeks later. Key challenges include the US trade war, slowing domestic demand, and the property market downturn.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124702626,imgsize-142550,width-400,resizemode-4/.jpg"

‘Game recognises game’ – Lessons from past trade wars

Renewed retaliation row







China has long criticised the United States for overstepping its boundaries to control foreign companies. Yet this month, Beijing did almost the same thing.To push back against Washington’s trade battle, China is now adopting US-style tactics.The south Asian giant announced a move, similar to the US, under which foreign firms must now get the Chinese government's approval to export magnets containing even small amounts of Chinese rare earth materials or made with Chinese technology.Jamieson Greer, US trade representative, explained, for instance, a smartphone maker in South Korea must also ask Beijing’s permission to sell devices to Australia in case the phones have China-originated rare earth materials.“This rule gives China control over basically the entire global economy in the technology supply chain.”Beijing’s move mirrors a US policy known as the foreign direct product rule, which lets America regulate products made abroad. This rule has often been used to restrict China’s access to US technologies, even through foreign firms.Neil Thomas, a fellow at the Asia Society Policy Institute, said, “China is learning from the best.”“Beijing is copying Washington’s playbook because it saw firsthand how effectively US export controls could constrain its own economic development and political choices.”He further told AP that “game recognises game.”China began adopting such measures after the 2018 trade war started under US President Donald Trump. Beijing felt the urgency to adopt a set of policies that it could use in case of more trade conflicts and hence looked at America for ideas.Created by the Chinese ministry of commerce in 2020, Unreliable Entity List, resembles the US entity list that blocks certain foreign companies.In 2021, China introduced an anti-foreign sanction law, allowing agencies to deny visas or freeze assets of unwelcome individuals or firms.China News called it a “toolkit against foreign sanctions,” adding Beijing would “hit back with the enemy's methods.”Scholar Li Qingming said the law “has combed through relevant foreign legislation and taken into consideration the international law and the basic principles of international relations,” and could deter escalation, AP reported.Jeremy Daum of Yale Law School said China often borrows foreign models when making laws for non-trade and non-foreign related areas.Earlier this year, the US President launched a new trade war with Beijing as soon as he returned to the White House for a second term. In response China deployed its new tools.Following Trump’s 10% tariff over fentanyl-related chemicals, Beijing added PVH Group and biotech company Illumina to its unreliable entity list, blocking them from China trade and investments. Export controls on critical materials like tungsten and bismuth followed.After a second 10% tariff in March, Beijing blacklisted more US companies and expanded export controls, targeting aerospace and defence firms. In April, during the so-called “Liberation Day” tariffs, China matched Trump’s 125% tariff, paused shipments of rare earth magnets, and blacklisted additional US firms.Daum warned the approach carries risks. “What one side sees as reciprocity the other might interpret as escalation.”“In a race to the bottom, nobody wins.”","Beijing is copying Washington’s playbook because it saw firsthand how effectively US export controls could constrain its own economic development and political choices.

US President Donald Trump spent Saturday playing golf with some of South Korea’s most powerful business leaders, in what analysts say could be a move to boost trade and investment ties between the two countries.According to the Pulse, the English service of Maeil business newspaper Korea, the round took place at the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach. It is the first known occasion a sitting US president has played golf with Korean corporate executives.Reported attendees included Samsung Electronics executive chairman Jay Y Lee, SK Group chairman Chey Tae-won, Hyundai Motor Group executive chair Euisun Chung, LG Group chairman Koo Kwang-mo, and Hanwha Group vice chairman Kim Dong-kwan.The meeting was organised by SoftBank Group chairman Masayoshi Son.According to the White House press pool, Trump arrived at 9:15 AM and stayed until 4:50 PM, spending about seven hours at the club. This marked his 11th round at the course since returning to office.The Korean executives reportedly travelled together in a limousine bus rather than in private cars. After Trump left, the bus was seen heading to a luxury hotel on Palm Beach Island, where Son and aides from the Korean delegation were later spotted.While the full agenda remains unknown, sources say the event was more than just a social gathering.""It's likely that President Trump held in-depth discussions with the heads of major Korean companies,"" an industry source said. ""Given that all the country's top business leaders were present, the meeting probably went beyond a simple round of golf.""The meeting comes as Seoul and Washington near the final stages of trade talks. It also coincides with South Korean conglomerates expanding significant investments in the US, including in semiconductors, batteries, automobiles, and energy.",US President Donald Trump spent Saturday playing golf with some of South Korea’s most powerful business leaders.

'No longer a one-way street'

What Trump wants in exchange for lower tariffs?

Fresh negotiations ahead





US President Donald Trump on Monday suggested that he might reduce tariffs on Chinese goods, but only if Beijing agrees “to do things” for the United States. These concessions include buying more US soybeans, halting restrictions on rare earth minerals, and other security concerns.Speaking with reporters aboard Air Force One, he said, “They're paying us a lot of money, tremendous amount of money in tariffs, and they'd probably like to have it be less. We'll work on that, but they have to give us some things too.""These comments come after the US announced an additional 100% tariff on Chinese imports to the country, effective from November 1, in response to China’s restrictions on rare earth mineral exports. This took the overall duty to a staggerring 130%.Referring to the 130% tariffs on Beijing, he said, “Right now, China's paying a tremendous amount of money in tariffs like they'd never paid before. You know, they paid a lot during my first administration, my first term.”China is paying “an unbelievable amount of money” to the United States, Trump said, adding, “they probably can't pay that much. And I'm okay with that.”“We can lower that, but they have to do things for us, too. It's no longer a one-way street.""Responding to where the reduced tariffs might land, he said that it ""depends. I mean, we'll have to see what they want.""“One of the penalties we have, because they're sending in fence and all we have a 20%, as you know, a 20% tariff on that. But they'd be paying about a 157% tariff, which is, you know, record-sending type tariff.”The US president further added that he wants to help China but expects something in return. “I don't want them to do that. I want to help China. I'm not looking to hurt China. But they have to give us things, too.”In turn for lower tariffs, Trump expects China to buy America’s soybean and “stop with the fentanyl.”“Very, you know, normal things. I don't want them to play the rare earth game with us.”He highlighted that American soybean farmers have been boycotted by China and hence a deal would not happen if Beijing fails to meet these demands.“Otherwise I'm not going to make a deal. No, I want them to buy. Our farmers have been boycotted by China as a negotiating point. I don't want that. Our farmers are great. And in particular our soybean farmers. And I want them to start buying soybeans at least in the amount that they were buying before. And I believe they'll be able to do that.”The comments come as the US and China prepare for a new round of trade negotiations “as soon as possible,” aimed at avoiding further damaging tariffs.The announcement followed a video call between Beijing’s chief negotiator, Vice Premier He Lifeng, and US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. State news agency Xinhua said the talks involved “candid, in-depth and constructive exchanges.”Tensions have risen since Trump announced the additional 100% tariff on Chinese goods. Taking to social media platform Truth Socialm he said, ""Based on the fact that China has taken this unprecedented position... the United States of America will impose a Tariff of 100% on China, over and above any Tariff that they are currently paying.""Meanwhile, Beijing also warned of retaliation if the US proceeds. “Wilful threats of high tariffs are not the right way to get along with China,” a commerce ministry spokesperson said, according to Xinhua.Despite earlier remarks that Trump would not meet Xi Jinping at this month’s APEC summit, a meeting between the two leaders still appears possible. Treasury secretary Bessent said, “He will be meeting with Party Chair Xi in Korea - I believe that meeting will still go ahead.”","US President Donald Trump suggested that he might reduce tariffs on Chinese goods, but only if Beijing agrees “to do things” for the United States.

Asian markets rose on Monday, boosted by Japan’s Nikkei, as the country moves closer to naming its first female prime minister. Investors are also watching US inflation data due this week, expected to have only a minor impact on plans for further rate cuts.Nikkei rallied 1383 points, up 2.9% to reach 48,965.

French luxury group Kering has agreed to sell its beauty division, including the high-end perfume brand Creed, to L’Oreal for $4.6 billion. The move marks a major step for Kering as it looks to tackle its growing debt.Under the agreement announced on Sunday, L’Oreal will also secure 50-year exclusive licences to make and sell beauty products for Kering’s top fashion houses, Gucci, Bottega Veneta and Balenciaga.These licences will come into force after Kering’s current partnership with US company Coty ends in 2028.Both companies described the deal as “a long-term strategic partnership in luxury beauty and wellness”. Valued at around €4 billion overall, the transaction is subject to regulatory approval, with completion expected in the first half of 2026.“Through Creed, we will establish ourselves as one of the leading players in the fast-growing niche fragrance market,” said Nicolas Hieronimus, chief executive of L’Oreal.The deal comes shortly after Luca de Meo took over as Kering’s new CEO. He has been tasked with reducing the group’s debt, which stands at around 9.5 billion Euros . In July, Kering reported a sharp decline in earnings, with net profit down 46% to 474 million Euros in the first half of the year, and revenue dropping 16% to 7.6 billion Euros.De Meo described the sale as a “decisive step for Kering”.","French luxury group Kering has agreed to sell its beauty division, including the high-end perfume brand Creed.

Reduced taxes to boost luxe spend: Rado,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/reduced-taxes-to-boost-luxe-spend-rado/articleshow/124695306.cms,"



MUMBAI: The trade agreement between India and the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) will allow Swiss luxury watch brands to offer more competitive pricing in the South Asian country, widening their appeal, said Adrian Bosshard, CEO at Rado which counts India as its biggest market, surpassing top luxury spenders China and the US.The trade pact under which India will reduce basic customs duty on Swiss watches, bringing it down to zero over a seven-year period will also compensate companies for currency losses (fluctuations in currency rates can erode earnings for exporters), Bosshard said. “I am very happy we were able to sign this agreement with India as step-by-step, taxes will be reduced. When you take out high taxes from a product, it’s definitely an advantage, without a doubt. It’s easier to buy luxury goods in places like Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Switzerland because of lower taxes,” Bosshard told TOI in an interview.For Rado, India has been recording a double-digit growth rate every year on the back of a broadening consumer base—while the firm’s old patrons continue to shop for its statement watches, the younger lot too is splurging on the luxury brand, many of whom are spending on its entry range collection starting at about Rs 1 lakh.“They are largely young working professionals who perceive a watch to be more than just a device displaying time—it’s an “experience, a statement,” Bosshard said.“This growth has come despite our distribution being at the same level. It is coming from the fact that more and more Indians can afford our watches due to rising purchasing power. India has a young, ambitious and hard-working population which is entering the luxury market,” said Bosshard. The brand’s local young shoppers in fact, are even spending on its more expensive selection such as Captain Cook which usually comes with a price tag of over Rs 2 lakh. The pre-Diwali sales in Sept have been very strong for Rado and the brand hopes to maintain the same trajectory for the festival-heavy month of Oct.The China market, Bosshard said, is still quite challenging for the luxury segment although the region seems to be stabilising gradually. The 39% US tariff on Switzerland came as a “big shock”, Bosshard said, adding that he hopes the rate can be renegotiated and brought at a level similar to the European Union which has been taxed at 15%. “We have a local US subsidiary and we were able to build up stock locally before the (tariff) decision was taken. That has helped us in the short term,” Bosshard said. Rado has raised prices in the US market but its sales have not been impacted given the scale and purchasing power of the market.","Rado counts India as its biggest market, surpassing top luxury spenders China and the US.

US stock markets are showing signs of shakiness as investors prepare for a week packed with corporate earnings and delayed inflation data.According to a Reuters report, major companies such as Tesla and Netflix are expected to provide a clearer picture of corporate profits, while the delayed September Consumer Price Index (CPI) will test market resilience.The fourth year of the S&P 500’s bull run began with notable swings after a long period of calm, driven by renewed US -China trade tensions and credit concerns at regional US banks. The CBOE market volatility index (VIX), known as Wall Street’s “fear gauge,” surged to its highest level in nearly six months on Friday.“The market is becoming more volatile, but it's also coming off of a very non-volatile period where we didn’t have a lot of risk catalysts bubbling to the top,” Michael Reynolds, VP of investment strategy at Glenmede told Reuters.“Once you have valuations hit sort of full levels, as we're seeing now almost across the board, you have to be on the lookout for incremental risk catalysts,” Reynolds added.The immediate trigger for volatility was a resurgence in US-China trade tensions. Stocks dropped last week after the US threatened to significantly hike tariffs by November 1 over China’s rare-earth export controls.President Donald Trump confirmed he will meet Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea in two weeks, keeping markets on alert.Credit worries at regional US banks also contributed to market jitters. While major indexes posted weekly gains, underlying trends point to cracks.According to Adam Turnquist, chief technical strategist at LPL Financial, the percentage of S&P 500 stocks in an uptrend has dropped from 77% in early July to 57%, while downtrends have increased from 23% to 44%. “That narrowing gap highlights emerging cracks in the market’s foundation,” he said.“If you have a fewer number of companies that are actually moving higher, but the indexes do move higher because of the megacaps, that's a really important divergence,” Kevin Gordon, senior investment strategist at Charles Schwab, emphasised the importance of breadth in market gains, told Reuters.Investors will closely watch third-quarter earnings, with reports from companies including Procter & Gamble, Coca-Cola, and major tech and aerospace firms, alongside Tesla and Netflix.With the US government shutdown halting economic data releases since October 1, corporate reports offer the best insight into broader economic health. “Corporate reports and what companies say is really our best chance at assessing what the broader economic health is,” Gordon added.The delayed CPI report, set for release on Friday, comes just days before the Federal Reserve’s October 28-29 meeting, where a quarter-point rate cut is widely anticipated.“We’d really have to see something out of left field in terms of notable inflation pressures to knock the Fed off of a rate cut path at the October meeting,” Reynolds added.","US stock markets are showing signs of shakiness as investors prepare for a week packed with corporate earnings and delayed inflation data.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying"".However, a report released by the State Bank of India (SBI) economists on Tuesday dismissed arguments that India is dangerously close to Hindu rate of growth saying such statements are ""ill-conceived, biased and premature"".The term 'Hindu growth rate' was coined by late economist Raj Krishna in 1978 to describe the slow growth in the country.It basically refers to the low pace of economic growth rates during 1950s to 1980s. During this period, the Indian economy averaged 3.5%.A former lecturer at the Delhi School of Economics (DSE), Krishna noted that only if the rate of growth is persistently slow and accompanied by low per-capita GDP, then it will be known as Hindu rate of growth but it has to factor in population growth as well.Before economic reforms of 1991, India's economic growth remained stagnant and low, while per capita income averaged around 1.3%.Krishna termed this low growth situation to be a result of socialist policies of state control and import substitution.However, the economic situation changed when liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation (LPG) reforms came into effect in the year 1991, at a time when India faced balance of payment crisis.Over the years, many economists have strongly opposed the idea of 'Hindu growth rate' and the term never had universal acceptance.The Indian economy plunged into its very first technical recession in FY21 due to the impact of Covid-19 pandemic and the related nationwide lockdowns. GDP shrunk by an unprecedented 23.8% in the first quarter of the financial year 2020-21. However, due to spurt in economic activities in the subsequent quarters, the GDP decline started to narrow.However, if we look at the period before Covid-19 as well, India's growth curve shows a declining trend.From 8.26% in FY17, GDP growth plunged to 3.74% in FY20. Shutdown of economic activities in FY21 in wake of Covid-19 only made matters worse.As lockdowns started to ease and business activities resumed, India's GDP also started rising. In Q1 of FY22, growth jumped to 20.1% mainly on account of low base effect. By the fourth quarter of FY22, growth came down to 4.10%.Similarly, the new financial year 2022-23 brought fresh economic challenges in the form of Russia-Ukraine war that impacted almost all major economies of the world, slowed the pace of growth, pushed inflation to record highs.As a result, the central banks of all advanced economies spurred into action and opted for monetary policy tightening to curb the soaring inflation.With persistently rising interest rates, India's economy grew by 4.4% in Q3 of FY23, as the Centre revised upwards GDP growth for previous year to 9.10% from 8.7% earlier.The report weighed recent GDP numbers against the available data on savings and investments for the past decade and highlighted some interesting points.""Quarterly growth numbers are noisy and should be best avoided for any serious interpretation (on an average, India's GDP growth has witnessed Rs 2 lakh crore upward revision for the 3 year ended FY23),"" the report said.Gross capital formation (GCF) by the government touched a high of 11.8% in 2021-22, up from 10.7% in 2020-21.""This also had a domino effect on private sector investment that jumped from 10 per cent to 10.8% over the same period,"" it said.In fact, Ecowrap added that the trends in GCF to gross output ratio or the plough back of funds for creation of fresh capacity shows that for public administration the ratio attained fresh peak in 2021-22 owing to the emphasis on capital expenditure in recent budgets.At the aggregate level, gross capital formation is supposed to have crossed 32% in 2022-23, the highest level since 2018-19.According to the report, in 2021-22, gross savings have risen to 30% from 29% in 2020-21.""The ratio is supposed to have crossed 31 per cent in 2022-23, the highest since 2018-19. The household savings increased sharply during the pandemic period on account of sharp accretion in financial savings such as deposits,"" said the report by SBI's Economic Research Department.While household financial savings have since then moderated from 15.4% in 2020-21 to 11.1% in 2022-23, savings in physical assets have grown sharply to 11.8% in 2021-22 from 10.7% in 2020-21.The report further analysed Incremental Capital Output ratio (ICOR) -- which measures additional units of capital (investment) needed to produce additional units of output. It said that the ratio has been improving.""ICOR which was 7.5 in FY 12 is now only 3.5 in FY22. Clearly, only half of capital is now needed for next unit of output,"" the report noted.Such reducing ICOR in the current years reflects a relatively increasing efficiency of capital and shows that the economy is on a sound footing, the report said.""From that point of view, future GDP growth rates even at 7% could still mean a decent number by any standards!,"" it added.","India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%. Raghuram Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying""","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-98483158,imgsize-65724,width-400,resizemode-4/98483158.jpg"

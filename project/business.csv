Stock market recommendations:In recent weeks, the Nifty index has showcased remarkable resilience, maintaining its upward trajectory and investor confidence despite a challenging macroeconomic and geopolitical environment. Escalating tensions in key global regions, which typically heighten market volatility, have not deterred the index's momentum. Additionally, the recent spike in crude oil prices—a factor that historically weighs heavily on the Indian economy due to its import dependence—has had a surprisingly muted impact on market sentiment. This strength in the face of adversity reflects underlying market optimism, robust domestic fundamentals, and continued participation from both institutional and retail investors.The Nifty has delivered a technically significant breakout, moving above the last 6 weeks’ range 25,200-24,500, closing decisively above the 25,200 marks. In Thursday's session it closed above 25,500 levels, its highest closing level in over eight months. This move not only reinforces the prevailing bullish momentum but also validates the sustained higher high–higher low-price structure, a classic hallmark of a well-established uptrend.Importantly, the positive market breadth—reflected in broad-based participation across sectors—adds conviction to the ongoing rally.Given this strength, we are revising our near-term upside target for the index to the 25,700–25,900 zone. This revised projection aligns with the measured move objective derived from the recent consolidation range between 24,500 and 25,200. The breakout from this congestion zone suggests a continuation pattern, and with technical indicators supporting the trend, we anticipate these levels to be achieved over the coming weeks.We are upwardly revising the immediate support base for the Nifty to the 24,800–25,000 zone. This zone now emerges as a critical demand area, as it coincides with the current week’s swing low and the 20-day exponential moving average (EMA), thereby forming a strong confluence support region.Sustained price action above this zone will reinforce the bullish bias and provide a launchpad for further upside. This area is expected to act as a key pivot in the near term, where any potential pullbacks could find buying interest. A hold above this support band will be instrumental in maintaining the current trend structure and confirming the strength of the ongoing breakout.Bank Nifty staged a strong uptrend last week, culminating in a fresh all-time high during Thursday’s session, driven in part by improved global risk sentiment following reports of a ceasefire between Israel and Iran. This breakout underscores the index's robust bullish undertone, further validated by its sustained position above the 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) since April—a key indicator of persistent upward momentum.From a structural standpoint, the index continues to exhibit a classic higher-high, higher-low formation, reflecting a well-established uptrend. The breadth of the rally remains healthy, with participation expanding across key banking constituents, thereby reinforcing the directional strength. Notably, Bank Nifty is displaying characteristics of trend elongation, where extended rallies are followed by shallow and orderly retracements—a technical sign of a strong and maturing trend.Given the recent breakout from the consolidation zone of 56,000–53,500, the implied pattern target projects an upside potential towards the 58,500 mark over the coming weeks. This projection is further supported by bullish price structure and momentum indicators.On the downside, the key support base has been recalibrated to the 55,000–55,500 region, which marks a confluence of technical factors—namely, the 50-day EMA and the recent swing lows of the past three weeks. This zone is likely to act as a strong accumulation area, and any corrective pullbacks into this region should be viewed as incremental buying opportunities within the broader uptrend.The stock has generated a breakout above the falling channel containing last 1 month’s corrective decline signaling resumption of up move and offers fresh entry opportunity.The stock is currently seen rebounding after a base formation around the 50 days EMA signaling overall positive bias.The daily 14 periods RSI has generated a buy signal moving above its nine periods average thus validating positive bias. We expect the stock to head higher towards 176 levels in the coming months being the 80% retracement of the entire previous decline (184-123).The stock has recently generated a breakout above a bullish cup and handle formation and is seen sustaining above the short- and medium-term moving averages thus supporting the positive bias.The breakout is supported by strong volume and the base of recent consolidation is placed at the 200 days EMA which supports the positive bias.The daily 14 periods RSI has generated a buy signal above its nine periods average signaling positive bias. We expect the stock to head towards 319 levels in the coming months being the 61.8% retracement of the entire decline (395-201).","According to Bajaj Broking Research, Tata Steel, and Lloyds Engineering Works are the top stock picks for today.

Bumble layoffs: 30% global workforce axed; CEO pushes reset to revive growth,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/bumble-layoffs-30-global-workforce-axed-ceo-pushes-reset-to-revive-growth/articleshow/122081877.cms,"Representative image (Picture credit: AP)

Bumble Inc. has announced plans to lay off nearly 30 per cent of its global workforce, affecting 240 employees, in a move aimed at cutting costs and repositioning the online dating firm for long-term growth.The company said it would reinvest savings of around $40 million into product innovation and technology development.The layoffs, confirmed in a regulatory filing on Wednesday, mark the latest shakeup in a struggling dating app sector grappling with economic headwinds and stagnating user growth.According to news agency Reuters, Bumble’s decision aligns with its broader strategy shift under CEO and founder Whitney Wolfe Herd, who returned to lead the firm in March amid mounting investor pressure.“This is an inflection point,” Wolfe Herd told employees in an internal email, as reported by CBS News. “We need to take decisive action to restructure to build a company that's resilient, intentional and ready for the next decade.”Bumble, which went public in 2021 with a $15 billion valuation, now trades at less than $7 per share, slashing its market capitalisation to just over $500 million. Shares jumped more than 23 per cent following the layoff announcement and even rose 21 per cent in midday trading, according to news agency Associated Press.The company also raised its second-quarter revenue forecast to $244 million–$249 million, up from the earlier guidance of $235 million–$243 million. While Bumble met Wall Street’s first-quarter expectations in May, it still reported a nearly 8 per cent revenue drop from a year ago, reported AP.During the same earnings call, Wolfe Herd admitted the platform had lost traction with users and promised improvements in match quality and user experience.“We are accelerating our efforts to improve our member base and show members a more thoughtful selection of high-quality, relevant profiles,” she had said, as cited by CBS News.Founded on the premise of women making the first move, Bumble has since adjusted its signature rule to drive growth. The firm also owns Badoo and had around 4.1 million paying users at the end of 2024, up 11 per cent year-on-year.However, overall revenue growth remained sluggish at under 2 per cent, and the company has continued to report losses, BBC reported.The strategic overhaul comes as the online dating space sees declining investor confidence and increasing competition. Rival Match Group, which owns Tinder, recently cut 13 per cent of its workforce.According to Reuters, Bumble's new direction under Wolfe Herd emphasises user experience over short-term revenue or growth metrics.Chandler Willison, analyst at M Science, was quoted by Reuters as saying that the restructuring reflects Bumble’s push to become more agile and return to a “startup-like” model. The company expects to incur $13 million–$18 million in one-time severance and related costs across Q3 and Q4 of 2025.A Bumble spokesperson said the layoffs align with the firm’s strategic goals. “Our focus now is on moving forward in a way that strengthens our core business, continues to serve our members effectively, and positions us for future growth,” the spokesperson said, as cited by CBS News.With this reset, Bumble hopes to navigate industry turbulence and reclaim its footing in a space increasingly defined by evolving user expectations and economic caution.(This is a top Google Trends topic)","Bumble Inc. has announced plans to lay off nearly 30 per cent of its global workforce, affecting 240 employees.

Gold has been dipping after a recent surge amidst tensions in the Middle East. With the US declaring a ceasefire between Iran and Israel, the safe haven demand for gold has somewhat gone down. What’s the outlook for gold and silver prices in the near future and what gold and silver rate levels should investors look at? Abhilash Koikkara, Head - Forex & Commodities, Nuvama Professional Clients Group shares his views:Gold is currently holding a crucial support level around ₹95,800. This zone is significant, as a strong reversal from here could potentially trigger a recovery in prices, targeting the ₹98,500 mark. This level also coincides with a previously unfilled gap, making it a key technical target for traders watching for a bounce.Despite a recent 4% correction in gold prices, the broader trend remains positive. The pullback is being viewed as a healthy retracement within a larger bullish structure, and market sentiment continues to favor the upside, especially amid ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty and global demand for safe-haven assets.A sustained move above ₹98,500 would be a strong bullish signal, clearing the way for a possible retest of the psychological ₹100,000 mark. Momentum traders may closely watch for confirmation above this resistance level to enter fresh long positions. On the downside, if ₹95,800 fails to hold, it could invite further selling pressure, but for now, the support remains intact. Overall, the bias remains positive, with technical indicators pointing to a potential recovery, provided key levels are respected. Investors are advised to stay alert for price action cues around the ₹95,800–₹98,500 range.MCX Silver has recently witnessed a sharp decline of around 5% from its recent highs, triggering short-term concerns among traders. However, despite this pullback, the broader trend for silver remains firmly positive. The recent correction appears to be a temporary pause within an ongoing bullish trajectory, rather than a reversal of the larger trend.The ₹102,500 level is emerging as a crucial support zone, and price action near this area will be key in determining the next move. This level has historically provided a base for reversals, and a strong bounce from here could reignite bullish momentum. Technical indicators suggest that as long as this support holds, the upside potential remains intact.On the higher side, silver prices have the potential to reclaim the ₹109,000 level, which represents a significant resistance zone and a near-term target for buyers. A sustained move above this resistance could pave the way for further gains in the medium term.Overall, while short-term volatility may persist, the underlying strength in silver remains. Traders and investors should closely monitor the ₹102,500 support for signs of reversal, as it could offer a favorable risk-reward entry point for the next leg higher.","Gold has been dipping after a recent surge amidst tensions in the Middle East.

‘End of New York City as we know it…’: Why Zohran Mamdani’s possible win in mayoral race has Wall Street fretting; sense of doom prevails,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/end-of-new-york-city-as-we-know-it-why-zohran-mamdanis-possible-win-in-mayoral-race-has-wall-street-fretting-sense-of-doom-prevails/articleshow/122085416.cms,"Zohran Mamdani (AP photo)

Rise of Zohran Mamdani

Wall Street worried

The possible victory of Zohran Mamdani, the 33-year-old democratic socialist, in the upcoming New York mayoral polls has people on Wall Street worried.In Manhattan's financial district, pessimistic predictions are circulating. According to Wall Street recruitment specialist Michael Nelson, his clientele, typically earning above $1 million annually, express serious concerns.""This will be the end of New York City as we know it"" reflects the sentiment amongst his affluent clients regarding Mamdani's potential November victory, he told Bloomberg.The impact is already visible in New York City property-related stocks. Flagstar Financial Inc., which provides loans to apartment complexes, experienced up to 6.7% decline on Wednesday. Property companies Empire State Realty Trust, SL Green Realty and Vornado Realty Trust also registered losses.Even critics acknowledge that Zohran Mamdani, the 33-year-old democratic socialist, has garnered significant public support.""It's officially hot commie summer,"" wrote hedge fund billionaire Dan Loeb on X, following Mamdani's unexpected victory over Andrew Cuomo in the Democratic primary for the New York City mayoral position.Also Read | Days of South Asians being ignored and erased in New York politics are gone, says Zohran Kwame Mamdani The statement reflects the genuine concern amongst the city's wealthy circles that a Mamdani victory in the November general election would result in increased taxation, potentially causing affluent residents to leave the five boroughs.An important detail is that Mamdani’s tax proposals would require approval from New York State Governor Kathy Hochul, who has expressed opposition. Additionally, Mamdani's plan to raise $70 billion in debt faces significant obstacles.According to Kathy Wylde, a prominent New York intermediary who has facilitated connections between business leaders from finance, real estate and media with city officials for years, whilst Mamdani appeals to the youth, his ideological stance causes significant concern among taxpayers and employers.However, Mamdani successfully gained support from voters across diverse socioeconomic and racial communities.In his Wednesday morning address, he emphasised that ""a life of dignity should not be reserved for a fortunate few.""The foundation of his success lay in a strategic social media campaign that combined populist economic policies and progressive cultural messaging through viral-worthy video content.On Tuesday, he featured in an Instagram video alongside Emily Ratajkowski, who commands over 29 million followers. The model and actress sported a ""Hot Girls for Zohran"" t-shirt whilst encouraging voter turnout.This exemplified the clever strategy that enabled Mamdani to build a substantial volunteer base numbering in tens of thousands. These supporters diligently canvassed neighbourhoods, maintained street presence and utilised social media to reach voters. They promoted his policy agenda: Free childcare, state-operated grocery shops with reduced prices, complimentary bus transport, rent controls and additional measures - largely funded through increased taxation of wealthy individuals.New York's establishment elite supported Cuomo, a 67-year-old Democratic veteran who positioned himself as an experienced centrist capable of addressing the city's challenges, from underground transit safety to the widely recognised cost-of-living issues.His campaign received substantial financial backing from prominent figures, including Michael R. Bloomberg, founder and primary owner of Bloomberg News parent Bloomberg LP, along with Bill Ackman, Loeb and Vornado's Steven Roth. His political action committee, Fix the City, accumulated an unprecedented primary campaign fund of nearly $25 million.However, the campaign's advertising strategy predominantly focused on criticising Mamdani rather than highlighting Cuomo's administrative plans. Despite resigning as New York governor following sexual harassment claims, which he contests, Cuomo maintained strong establishment support, including an endorsement from former President Bill Clinton.In contrast, Mamdani received endorsements from progressive leaders, including Democratic Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Senator Bernie Sanders.Some financial sector representatives appear to be considering a more accepting stance towards the democratic socialist candidate.""While we might disagree on certain issues, we should always be hopeful that Mamdani — if he ends up being elected mayor — can unite the city to address its critical education, public safety, housing and economic development needs,"" said Ralph Schlosstein, former head of Evercore Inc. and a longtime Democrat, according to the Bloomberg report.According to Rich Farley, an experienced Wall Street legal expert, numerous affluent residents view the November general election as crucial. A Mamdani victory could prompt wealthy individuals to seriously consider relocating from the city.Before this contest, high-net-worth donors must determine their stance towards Mamdani. Cuomo, potentially running as an independent, needs to convince supporters of his viability outside the Democratic primary framework.Should he continue his campaign, he will face Republican Curtis Sliwa and incumbent Eric Adams, who is running independently after avoiding the primary following corruption allegations.Some Wall Street professionals are contemplating more decisive actions.""I've already talked to hedge fund guys who have told me they have got a foot out the door,"" said Eric Rosen, who previously held senior positions at JPMorgan and in hedge fund management.""I left New York City 8 years ago because I didn't like the way the city was being run,"" he said. ""I sold my Park Ave. co-op and its now down 25% and my house in Florida is up 250%. The market has spoken.""","Zohran Mamdani, the 33-year-old democratic socialist, won the Democratic primary for the New York City mayoral position.

Asia stocks surge: Markets hit 3-year high; oil prices edge up despite weekly drop,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/asia-stocks-surge-markets-hit-3-year-high-oil-prices-edge-up-despite-weekly-drop/articleshow/122102955.cms,"Representative image (Picture credit: AP)

Asian equities surged to multi-year highs on Friday, mirroring Wall Street’s optimism, as easing geopolitical concerns and expectations of interest rate cuts lifted investor sentiment across the region.Meanwhile, oil prices posted modest gains but remained on track for a significant weekly decline amid easing Middle East supply risks and growing optimism over US-Iran diplomacy.According to news agency Reuters, MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan touched its highest level since November 2021 and was last up 0.2%, set to end the week nearly 3% higher.Japan’s Nikkei 225 jumped 1.5%, crossing the 40,000 mark for the first time in five months, supported by improved sentiment and robust earnings.The rally was buoyed by several positive developments, including a breakthrough between Washington and Beijing on rare earth shipments and news that the US may scrap a controversial tax proposal, a move that had earlier worried foreign investors.Khoon Goh, head of Asia research at ANZ, was quoted by Reuters as saying that the reversal ""allays one of the concerns from foreign investors.""European markets also reflected the upbeat tone, with futures on the EUROSTOXX 50 and Germany’s DAX up 0.6%, while FTSE futures climbed 0.16%.The optimism comes amid growing speculation that the US Federal Reserve will begin cutting interest rates soon.As per Bloomberg, a sharp drop in the US dollar has helped lift Asian currencies and fuel demand for regional assets. The Bloomberg Dollar Index is set for its sixth consecutive monthly decline, its worst losing streak since 2017.With Trump reportedly considering a replacement for Fed Chair Jerome Powell by October, concerns about the Fed’s independence have further weakened the greenback.Investor appetite in Asia has also been driven by blockbuster fundraising activity, with IPO volumes across Hong Kong and Tokyo rising sharply. Regional companies have raised over $90 billion through share sales this year, a 25% increase from the same period in 2024.In commodities, oil prices rose slightly on Friday but remained poised for their steepest weekly decline in over a year. Brent crude gained 0.41% to $68.01 a barrel, while West Texas Intermediate rose 0.46% to $65.53, Reuters reported.Despite the modest rise, both benchmarks were down more than 10% this week, reversing gains from the initial surge following the Israel-Iran conflict.According to the US Energy Information Administration, crude inventories dropped by 5.8 million barrels in the week to June 20, far exceeding expectations, as summer driving demand increased.Still, a ceasefire between Israel and Iran has eased fears of major disruptions, limiting further gains.As per Bloomberg, markets are now shifting their attention to upcoming trade decisions in Washington and a crucial OPEC+ meeting on July 6, where production policy for August will be determined.Reuters quoted Phil Flynn of the Price Futures Group as saying, “The market is starting to digest the fact that crude oil inventories are very tight all of a sudden,” adding that a weaker dollar is also supporting prices.Despite lingering uncertainties around US trade tariffs and Iran’s future oil exports, the market’s focus has returned to fundamentals. Citi analysts noted that Trump’s swift ceasefire push “suggests he remains sensitive to high oil prices,” potentially capping geopolitical risk premiums.With investor optimism returning and central banks signalling support, Asia’s equity and credit markets appear well-positioned, though analysts warn the road ahead may still hold “a few more twists,” especially with upcoming trade deadlines.","MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan touched its highest level since November 2021. Japan's Nikkei 225 jumped 1.5%, crossing the 40,000 mark for the first time in five months.

Gold Outlook: Technical Highlights:

Gold Trading Strategy

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market and other asset classes given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)

Gold price prediction today: Gold rate has been dipping for the last few days and the Iran-Israel ceasefire has quietened the sentiment for safe haven assets. Where are gold prices headed and what should investors do? Here's the analysis from Jateen Trivedi, VP Research Analyst - Commodity and Currency, LKP Securities:Gold futures continue to reflect selling pressure as technical indicators signal a weakening short-term structure. The MCX Gold August Futures (05AUG2025) are currently trading near ₹97,087, having struggled to sustain above key resistance levels. A gap-down movement in the last few sessions, combined with soft momentum indicators, supports a Sell on Rise strategy for today’s trade.1. EMA Confluence: The 8-day EMA is at ₹97,050 and the 21-day EMA is at ₹97,100. The price is hovering below both averages, confirming a short-term bearish crossover. This alignment indicates that selling on minor upticks toward ₹97,300–₹97,400 could offer favorable risk-reward setups for intraday traders.2. Bollinger Bands: Price is currently trading near the lower Bollinger Band, hinting at continued downward bias. The lack of bullish reversal candles near the band suggests limited buying interest at lower levels.3. Previous Day’s Pivot Zone: Based on the pivot structure, the region between ₹97,300–₹97,400 aligns with prior resistance.A failure to close above this area may keep bulls sidelined, reinforcing short trades near this zone.4. RSI (14): The Relative Strength Index is at 47.72, below the neutral 50 mark. While not in oversold territory, it shows weakening momentum, in line with the bearish price structure.5. MACD (not shown, inferred): Based on the recent downward crossover observed on the intraday charts and price trend, MACD likely continues to reflect bearish divergence. This aligns with the broader outlook of selling pressure.6. Price Structure: The recent fall below both short-term moving averages and the failure to bounce back decisively suggest the formation of a bearish flag or continuation pattern. Any bounce toward ₹97,300–₹97,400 can be used as a fresh shorting opportunity with stops placed just above the 21-EMA.For June 27, traders should consider a Sell on Rise strategy in the ₹97,300–₹97,400 zone, with downside targets of ₹96,700 and further toward ₹96,200 if weakness persists. A stop-loss can be maintained above ₹97,650 to manage risk. Strong global cues and a fragile technical setup continue to weigh on gold prices in the short term.","Gold futures continue to reflect selling pressure as technical indicators signal a weakening short-term structure.

"Need investment, skilling drive to boost jobs: Study",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/need-investment-skilling-drive-to-boost-jobs-study/articleshow/122102915.cms,"NEW DELHI: While estimating the possibility of employing up to 35 crore workers in manufacturing and services by 2030, a new study has recommended a massive skilling drive and a focus on investments to ensure that there is gainful employment in the economy.In a paper, ""Pathways to Jobs,"" presented by a team of economists from NCAER led by economist Farzana Afridi, it was estimated that since 2017-18, the country's workforce increased by around nine crore, but around six crore jobs were added. A bulk of the projected jobs - around 28 crore - are expected to come in the services sector. It, however, argued that higher investment in labour-intensive manufacturing and services can lead to a doubling of employment in the economy as there would be inter-sectoral linkages.It noted that the proportion of the labour force engaged in agriculture has declined, while the manufacturing sector's contribution has remained stagnant. What has added to the complication for policymakers is the trend of declining labour intensity of production. In addition, there is an insufficient supply of skilled workers, an issue which the economists said needed to be addressed urgently.While there were changes since 2017-18 with faster growth in high-skill employment, there is a greater concentration of these workers in the services space.""There was a decline in the share of untrained workers over time. In 2018, 92% of workers had no training, which fell to 65% by 2024. However, the majority of workers remain untrained. As of 2024, only 4% of workers received formal training,"" the paper said.The economists made a case for students to be offered a choice to go for academic or vocational education, with training expected to result in additional job creation. At the macro level, the policy recommendations included higher expenditure, along with lower taxes, incentives to spur investment, and easier labour regulations.","A new study has recommended a massive skilling drive and a focus on investments to ensure that there is gainful employment in the economy.

Data from Reserve Bank of India, based on financial statements of 3,902 listed non-government non-financial firms, point to a broad-based if uneven recovery-tempered by rising input costs and tightening margins.Manufacturing companies saw sales climb by 6.0%, up from 3.5% the year before. The uptick owed much to strong performances in automobiles, electrical machinery, food and beverages, and pharmaceuticals. Yet, this momentum was offset by contractions in petroleum and metals, particularly iron and steel, reflecting the drag from commodity price volatility and weak global demand.The services sector fared better. Information technology firms, despite navigating global uncertainties, clocked 7.1% growth, up from 5.5%. More striking was the surge in non-IT services, where double-digit growth was underwritten by buoyant telecom, logistics, and trade-related activity.Still, cost pressures loomed large. Manufacturers grappled with a 6.6% rise in raw material costs, and the ratio of such costs to sales edged higher, hinting at tighter operating conditions. Staff expenses too ticked up across the board-by 10% for manufacturers, 4.4% for IT firms, and 12% for non-IT services-suggesting wage pressures in a still-tight labour market. Margins, predictably, suffered. Manufacturing firms saw their operating profit margins shrink by 20bps to 14.2%.","Manufacturing companies saw sales climb by 6.0%, up from 3.5% the year before.

As recently as 2023, China was the world's biggest exporter of urea, but a ban on overseas shipments was put in place last June to cut domestic prices to aid farmers and bolster food security.So far, the quota for urea exports has been set at about 2 million tons for the near term, according to Gavin Ju, an analyst at CRU Group in Beijing.""The original intent of the policy was to secure domestic supplies and stabilize prices at a level that farmers could afford,"" he said. ""Local prices have remained within a reasonable range. So taking into consideration affordability for farmers and profits for urea companies, it makes sense to loosen controls on exports.""Urea prices in Shandong, a top producing province, fell to the lowest in more than seven years in Jan and have remained subdued since then.","Limits on exports of the fertilizer will be loosened from this month, according to people familiar with matter.

ITR e-filing FY 2024-25: Which Form For Gig Workers?

Importantly, ITR-1 and ITR-2 do not apply to income from freelancing or gig work. Selecting the correct form is crucial for smooth return processing and to avoid errors or compliance notices.

Freelancers maintaining books of accounts and claiming actual business expenses should file ITR-3 .

. Alternatively, those in specified professions—such as legal, accounting, or technical consultancy etc—with gross receipts up to Rs 50 lakh (or Rs 75 lakh if cash receipts do not exceed 5% of the total gross receipts) may opt for ITR-4 under the presumptive taxation scheme. Under the presumptive taxation scheme, 50% of gross receipts are deemed taxable, simplifying compliance by eliminating the need for detailed bookkeeping.

As Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez prepare for a jaw-dropping $23–$34 million wedding in Venice, many American couples are facing the opposite challenge, trimming costs and rethinking their dream celebrations in the face of economic pressures and rising tariffs.According to USA Today, the extravagant Bezos-Sánchez affair, expected to draw stars like Mick Jagger, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Oprah Winfrey, comes at a time when the average US wedding cost just $33,000 in 2024.That’s nearly 1,000 times less than what the billionaire founder of Amazon and his fiancée are reportedly spending.Even the engagement ring Sánchez sports, a pink diamond worth $2.5 million, as revealed to Vogue, dwarfs the $5,200 average spent on rings last year, according to The Knot’s Real Weddings 2025 Study.Meanwhile, American couples are feeling the pinch from more modest but still significant financial challenges. As per USA Today, tariffs on imported flowers, gowns, and wedding supplies are quietly pushing budgets upward.Nearly 80% of flowers and 90% of bridal gowns sold in the US are imported, making them vulnerable to international trade policies.Florist and bride-to-be Allison Krivachek was quoted by USA Today as saying that she’s seen floral costs rise 10–25% due to tariffs, pushing her to get creative with sustainable, local options.“I want to make that a trend,” she said, explaining her use of potted plants and bushes that couples can replant after the ceremony.Vendors are also stepping in to help couples navigate pricing pressures. As per USA Today, Lauren Kay of The Knot said, “They want to help you have the best wedding ever... whether that’s avoiding a tariff or making a trade-off so your budget isn’t terribly impacted.”In a recent survey by The Knot, 73% of engaged couples said staying within budget was their top priority. About 36% admitted they were already adjusting plans due to inflation or economic uncertainty, with 28% reducing guest counts and others booking early or opting for US-made goods.While Bezos’ upcoming wedding has drawn sharp criticism in Venice, with protestors accusing him of symbolising inequality and exploiting the city, many Americans are simply trying to make their big day affordable.The stark contrast between the Venice spectacle and the financial reality of average weddings underscores a growing economic divide, even in moments meant for joy and celebration.","Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez are reportedly spending $23–$34 million on their wedding.

How did imports drag down US GDP ?

The US economy shrank by 0.5% on an annual basis in the first quarter of 2025, as President Donald Trump’s trade war prompted a rush of imports, disrupting businesses, the commerce department announced on Thursday.This unexpected sharp downgrade from an earlier estimate of a 0.2% decline, reflects the economic fallout from Trump’s trade policies, which saw American firms scrambling to import goods before tariffs could take effect.The surge in imports, up by a staggering 37.9%, the fastest pace since 2020, dragged down the GDP by almost 4.7 percentage points, AP reported.This contraction marks the first quarterly decline in the US economy in three years, reversing the 2.4% growth recorded in the final three months of 2024.Consumer spending also took a significant hit, slowing to just 0.5% growth, a steep fall from the 4% recorded in the previous quarter and well below earlier government estimates.A key measure of the economy’s underlying strength, grew at an annual rate of 1.9% between January and March. That’s a noticeable slowdown from the 2.9% pace seen in the final quarter of 2024. The category includes consumer spending and private investment while excluding more volatile components such as exports, inventories and government spending.Federal government spending also slumped, falling at a 4.6% annual rate, the steepest decline since 2022.GDP or the Gross Domestic Product includes only what is produced domestically, not what is imported from foreign lands. Hence, the imports that are reflected in the GDP report as consumer spending or business investments, must be subtracted to avoid inflating figures.Economists, however, believe the slump may prove short-lived. The import-driven distortion seen in the first quarter is not expected to repeat in the April-to-June period. Many forecasters anticipate a rebound, with second-quarter GDP growth projected to reach 3%, according to a FactSet survey.The first official estimate of second-quarter GDP is due on 30 July.","US economy shrank by 0.5% on an annual basis in the first quarter of 2025.

US Steel merger: Donald Trump to hold power over company’s future via ‘golden share’ in Nippon acquisition; deal valued at nearly $15 billion,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-steel-merger-donald-trump-to-hold-power-over-companys-future-via-golden-share-in-nippon-acquisition-deal-valued-at-nearly-15-billion/articleshow/122090961.cms,"File photo: US President Donald Trump (Picture credit: PTI)

US President Donald Trump will directly control a special “golden share” as part of the national security agreement that cleared the path for Japan’s Nippon Steel to acquire US Steel, according to disclosures filed with the US Securities and Exchange CommissionAs per news agency AP, this unique arrangement allows Trump, or a designee named by him, to veto key decisions involving the American steelmaker, a power that shifts to the treasury and commerce departments only when another individual holds the presidency.The provision specifically names Trump and stipulates that “at any time when Donald J Trump is serving as President of the United States of America, the written consent of Donald J Trump or President Trump’s Designee” is required for certain decisions.The deal, valued at nearly $15 billion, was finalised last week, making US Steel a wholly owned subsidiary of Nippon Steel. It also includes significant commitments from Nippon, such as investing $11 billion to modernise US Steel’s aging facilities. US Steel announced the merger completion in a joint statement with Nippon on June 13, adding that a golden share would be issued to the US government, as per news agency AFP.While the White House has clarified that the golden share is not exclusive to Trump but to the sitting president, filings indicate the language is specific to Trump’s term in office, reported AP.The agreement grants Trump sweeping authority over decisions related to domestic steel production.This includes the ability to veto any changes to capital investment commitments, relocation of production or jobs outside the US, closure of plants, mergers with competitors, or even renaming the company or moving its headquarters from Pittsburgh.The national security agreement emerged after months of political backlash. Trump had initially opposed the deal during the 2024 campaign, aligning with labour unions and critics concerned about outsourcing and national interest.However, he later recast the transaction as a “planned partnership” on social media, once Nippon agreed to stronger investment commitments and more government oversight.Despite efforts to portray it as a partnership, the deal marks a full acquisition. On June 13, US Steel delisted from the New York Stock Exchange following confirmation of the merger.While the full national security agreement has not been publicly released, filings and company statements outline its scope. The provision is seen as a way to ensure continued US oversight over strategic assets amid concerns about foreign control in key industries.","US President Donald Trump will directly control a special ‘golden share’ as part of the national security agreement that cleared the path for Japan’s Nippon Steel to acquire US Steel.

Although the tax office did not announce a timeline, the rule could come into effect as early as next month, as per sources cited by the agency.“The rule is still in the works and will be announced and explained to the public after,” the tax office said, adding that platforms and stakeholders have been consulted and have so far indicated support.However, Indonesia’s e-commerce association, idEA, urged caution. While agreeing to comply with government policy, the group also highlighted the need for a phased implementation to avoid disrupting the operations of millions of sellers.The upcoming changes are expected to impact major online marketplaces, including TikTok Shop and Tokopedia (run by ByteDance), Shopee (Sea Ltd), Lazada (backed by Alibaba), Blibli, and Bukalapak.According to one source, penalties for late reporting are also being considered.ByteDance, which operates Tokopedia is home to around 12 million sellers and with a transaction value of 249 trillion rupiah ($15.3 billion) in 2023, called for a realistic adjustment period.“We hope its implementation takes into account the need for adequate preparation time for various aspects. This includes the technical readiness of platforms and the capacity of sellers, especially small and medium-sized enterprises, to comply,” TikTok stated.The tax office clarified that the levy is aimed at improving oversight of vendors who operate outside the tax system, often due to the perceived complexity of filing requirements.Indonesia’s e-commerce sector continues to boom, with its gross merchandise value projected to more than double from $65 billion in 2023 to $150 billion by 2030, according to a report by Google, Temasek and Bain & Co.","Indonesia is drafting a new regulation to tackle its “shadow economy,” making changes to how sellers and platforms operate.

Bitcoin continued its upward momentum on Thursday, briefly surpassing the $108,000 mark as geopolitical tensions eased and institutional participation in crypto assets showed signs of strengthening.As of 11:50 am IST, the world’s leading cryptocurrency was trading at $107,800, up 1.5 per cent on the day, after touching a daily high of $108,305, according to Economic Times.Ethereum also posted gains, rising 1.8 per cent to trade at $2,481. The total cryptocurrency market capitalisation rose by 1 per cent to reach $3.3 trillion, as per CoinMarketCap data.Among altcoins, XRP, BNB, Chainlink, and Litecoin recorded modest gains of up to 1 per cent. However, others—including Solana, Tron, Dogecoin, Cardano, Hyperliquid, Sui, Avalanche, and Toncoin—saw declines of up to 2.5 per cent, indicating cautious sentiment among retail traders.""The crypto market is finding its footing with a cautiously optimistic undertone,"" said Avinash Shekhar, Co-Founder & CEO of Pi42.""Bitcoin has climbed over 3 per cent in the past seven days, showing firm support from market participants. A retest of the $110,000 level seems likely if current levels hold,"" he added, speaking toSathvik Vishwanath, Co-Founder & CEO of Unocoin, observed, ""Bitcoin shows signs of an impending breakout, with elevated open interest and neutral funding rates. Liquidation clusters between $106K and $110K suggest potential for stop-hunts. A decisive move above $108.5K could trigger momentum toward $112K–$115K.""Vikram Subburaj, CEO of Giottus, noted that Friday’s $20 billion options expiry could lead to increased market volatility.""Order book data shows rising interest near $111,000. However, $104,000 remains the key level to watch on the downside,"" he said.Institutional buying has added to the bullish momentum. BlackRock ETFs reportedly acquired 3,210 BTC and 22,550 ETH, while Japanese investment firm Metaplanet purchased 1,234 BTC worth $132.7 million—surpassing Tesla’s Bitcoin holdings. Separately, GameStop raised $450 million through zero-interest notes and announced its intention to allocate a portion of the funds to Bitcoin as a reserve asset.However, regulatory concerns persist. Barclays Bank will implement a ban on cryptocurrency purchases via credit cards starting June 27, a move expected to affect retail investor accessibility in the UK.According to the CoinDCX research team, Bitcoin’s strength is lifting overall sentiment.""Bitcoin's positive influence on market sentiment is clear, with certain altcoins like Pi, Kaspa, and Bitcoin Cash showing significant gains. The overall market trend remains largely stable, setting the stage for the next bullish wave,"" the team said.Meanwhile, some previously high-performing tokens such as Sei, Fartcoin, Stacks, and Curve DAO Token saw sharp declines of 8–10 per cent, likely due to profit-taking.Ethereum held firm above $2,470, with analysts expressing confidence in a possible move toward $2,800. ""ETF flows for Ether have been strong, though futures data shows some caution among traders,"" added Shekhar of Pi42.Looking ahead, analysts expect the market to trade within a narrow range, driven by technical indicators and liquidity conditions, until new macroeconomic data- particularly inflation-related- comes into play.""Stay alert for volatility expansion,"" Vishwanath cautioned.

Asian equities were largely flat on Thursday while oil prices stabilised, as markets took stock of easing geopolitical tensions and awaited fresh cues on US fiscal and trade policy, especially US President Donald Trump’s looming tariff deadline.According to news agency Reuters, investors remained cautious amid uncertainties surrounding Federal Reserve leadership and potential shifts in US interest rate policy.The MSCI’s broad index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan held steady, while Tokyo’s Nikkei climbed 0.9% to touch a four-month high. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng gained 1.2% and the Shanghai Composite rose 1%, supported by optimism following a ceasefire between Israel and Iran that soothed global supply concerns.Meanwhile, oil markets saw mild gains. Brent crude inched up 0.2% to $67.82 per barrel and US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) rose 0.28% to $65.10, rebounding from sharp losses earlier this week.A day earlier, both benchmarks had climbed nearly 1% following data indicating strong US fuel demand and easing geopolitical risks. Brent had settled at $67.68 and WTI at $64.92 on Wednesday.US government data showed crude inventories dropped by 5.8 million barrels last week, while gasoline demand hit its highest since December 2021.""This type of report can refocus on US supply and demand, and less on geopolitics,"" said Price Futures Group analyst Phil Flynn, as quoted by Reuters.Market confidence was also supported by a fragile ceasefire between Iran and Israel, announced by US President Trump, that has helped oil prices return to near pre-conflict levels.Still, ING analysts noted that concerns over Middle East supply haven’t fully dissipated, with ""stronger demand for immediate supply"" continuing to support prices.Adding to market volatility was speculation around Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s future, as Trump is reportedly considering replacing him by September or October. This weighed on the US dollar and lifted the euro to $1.6805, its highest since November 2021, while the Swiss franc hit a 10-year high.The dollar index slumped to its lowest since March 2022.“The issue with this is it will resurface questions around the Fed’s independence, which… undermines confidence in the Fed and the USD,” said IG analyst Tony Sycamore, as cited by Reuters.Equity markets globally remain sensitive to signals from central banks, especially with Trump’s July 9 deadline for finalising new trade tariffs approaching. While Powell has reiterated that potential tariffs may cause a “one-time jump in prices”, he warned that the risks of more persistent inflation justify caution.Bank of America strategists, quoted by Reuters, added that “unsustainable fiscal dynamics can trigger an accident in bond markets,” highlighting the need for global fiscal vigilance.Overall, analysts expect oil to consolidate between $65-70 per barrel as traders track US macroeconomic data and the Fed’s next rate move.While the global market mood appears to be stabilising, investors remain watchful for how tariffs, inflation, and central bank responses will shape economic trajectories in the months ahead.",MSCI's broad index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan held steady.

The 2.6% surge in early trading reflected growing investor confidence in the chipmaker’s leadership in the booming artificial intelligence (AI) sector.The rally was partly driven by market anticipation ahead of Micron Technology’s quarterly earnings, due after market hours. Micron manufactures high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips, a key component in Nvidia’s advanced AI accelerators.Strong results from Micron are expected to signal continued demand across the AI hardware supply chain, further reinforcing Nvidia’s bullish outlook.Beyond hardware, Nvidia’s growth is being propelled by its expanding software and cloud services business. Its DGX Cloud platform — which allows organisations to run large-scale AI workloads on Nvidia’s infrastructure — has seen adoption across industries such as healthcare, finance, and manufacturing. This marks a strategic shift, positioning Nvidia as not just a chipmaker but a full-stack AI solutions provider.Investor optimism has remained strong since Nvidia’s impressive first-quarter earnings in late May, which beat analyst estimates and highlighted robust revenue growth.The company’s performance remains resilient despite geopolitical headwinds, including US export restrictions on chip sales to China, once a major market.The focus now turns to Micron’s earnings, expected to provide broader insight into the strength and sustainability of the AI hardware boom.Earlier this month, Nvidia briefly became the world’s most valuable publicly listed company, overtaking Microsoft. It has been trading market-cap leadership with Microsoft and Apple since mid-2023. The latest surge reestablishes Nvidia’s dominance, underscoring its rapid ascent as a key force in the AI revolution.As global demand for AI infrastructure continues to rise, Nvidia’s position at the heart of the technology ecosystem appears increasingly unshakable.","Nvidia shares soared to an all-time high of $152.97 on Wednesday, surpassing its previous record close of $149.43 set in January.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume.

Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.","Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor ( CEA ) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran Udaan until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.Udaan built an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business still accounts for a very small part of India’s overall retail market but can balloon to $150 billion in sales and yield a 100% return on capital invested in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co. estimates published in the Mint newspaper.Bengaluru-based Udaan has also ventured into financing through its fintech unit which helps shopkeepers get working capital loans to buy inventory. That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says.

How India's GDP has been growing

What SBI report said on savings and investment

Incremental capital output ratio

NEW DELHI: India's gross domestic product (GDP) data for the third quarter (October-December 2022) received a word of caution from the former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan In an interview with news agency PTI, Rajan that India is ""dangerously close"" to the Hindu rate of growth in view of subdued private sector investment, high interest rates and slowing global growth.India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying"".However, a report released by the State Bank of India (SBI) economists on Tuesday dismissed arguments that India is dangerously close to Hindu rate of growth saying such statements are ""ill-conceived, biased and premature"".The term 'Hindu growth rate' was coined by late economist Raj Krishna in 1978 to describe the slow growth in the country.It basically refers to the low pace of economic growth rates during 1950s to 1980s. During this period, the Indian economy averaged 3.5%.A former lecturer at the Delhi School of Economics (DSE), Krishna noted that only if the rate of growth is persistently slow and accompanied by low per-capita GDP, then it will be known as Hindu rate of growth but it has to factor in population growth as well.Before economic reforms of 1991, India's economic growth remained stagnant and low, while per capita income averaged around 1.3%. Krishna termed this low growth situation to be a result of socialist policies of state control and import substitution.However, the economic situation changed when liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation (LPG) reforms came into effect in the year 1991, at a time when India faced balance of payment crisis.Over the years, many economists have strongly opposed the idea of 'Hindu growth rate' and the term never had universal acceptance.The Indian economy plunged into its very first technical recession in FY21 due to the impact of Covid-19 pandemic and the related nationwide lockdowns. GDP shrunk by an unprecedented 23.8% in the first quarter of the financial year 2020-21. However, due to spurt in economic activities in the subsequent quarters, the GDP decline started to narrow.However, if we look at the period before Covid-19 as well, India's growth curve shows a declining trend.From 8.26% in FY17, GDP growth plunged to 3.74% in FY20. Shutdown of economic activities in FY21 in wake of Covid-19 only made matters worse.As lockdowns started to ease and business activities resumed, India's GDP also started rising. In Q1 of FY22, growth jumped to 20.1% mainly on account of low base effect. By the fourth quarter of FY22, growth came down to 4.10%.Similarly, the new financial year 2022-23 brought fresh economic challenges in the form of Russia-Ukraine war that impacted almost all major economies of the world, slowed the pace of growth, pushed inflation to record highs.As a result, the central banks of all advanced economies spurred into action and opted for monetary policy tightening to curb the soaring inflation.With persistently rising interest rates, India's economy grew by 4.4% in Q3 of FY23, as the Centre revised upwards GDP growth for previous year to 9.10% from 8.7% earlier.The report weighed recent GDP numbers against the available data on savings and investments for the past decade and highlighted some interesting points.""Quarterly growth numbers are noisy and should be best avoided for any serious interpretation (on an average, India's GDP growth has witnessed Rs 2 lakh crore upward revision for the 3 year ended FY23),"" the report said.Gross capital formation (GCF) by the government touched a high of 11.8% in 2021-22, up from 10.7% in 2020-21.""This also had a domino effect on private sector investment that jumped from 10 per cent to 10.8% over the same period,"" it said.In fact, Ecowrap added that the trends in GCF to gross output ratio or the plough back of funds for creation of fresh capacity shows that for public administration the ratio attained fresh peak in 2021-22 owing to the emphasis on capital expenditure in recent budgets.At the aggregate level, gross capital formation is supposed to have crossed 32% in 2022-23, the highest level since 2018-19.According to the report, in 2021-22, gross savings have risen to 30% from 29% in 2020-21.""The ratio is supposed to have crossed 31 per cent in 2022-23, the highest since 2018-19. The household savings increased sharply during the pandemic period on account of sharp accretion in financial savings such as deposits,"" said the report by SBI's Economic Research Department.While household financial savings have since then moderated from 15.4% in 2020-21 to 11.1% in 2022-23, savings in physical assets have grown sharply to 11.8% in 2021-22 from 10.7% in 2020-21.The report further analysed Incremental Capital Output ratio (ICOR) -- which measures additional units of capital (investment) needed to produce additional units of output. It said that the ratio has been improving.""ICOR which was 7.5 in FY 12 is now only 3.5 in FY22. Clearly, only half of capital is now needed for next unit of output,"" the report noted.Such reducing ICOR in the current years reflects a relatively increasing efficiency of capital and shows that the economy is on a sound footing, the report said.""From that point of view, future GDP growth rates even at 7% could still mean a decent number by any standards!,"" it added.","India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.

An employee is entitled for a 50 per cent amount of the last drawn salary as pension.OPS was discontinued by the NDA government in 2003 with effect from April 1, 2004.Under the new pension scheme (NPS), employees contribute 10 per cent of their basic salary towards pension while the government contributes 14 per cent.Governments of Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand have informed the central government/ Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority ( PFRDA about their decision to restart OPS for their employees.The government of Punjab on November 18, 2022, issued a notification regarding implementation of OPS for the state government employees who are being covered under NPS. Jharkhand too has decided to revert to OPS.",Former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan has expressed his concern over the decision of some states to restart the old pension scheme.

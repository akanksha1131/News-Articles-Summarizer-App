Stock market crash today: Indian equity benchmarks, Nifty50 and BSE Sensex , crashed in trade on Tuesday, with a sharp selloff in the latter half of the session. Technology stocks led the fall amid uneven earnings signals, while ongoing global trade uncertainties unleashed by US President Donald Trump and sustained foreign investor selling weighed heavily on market sentiment.Nifty50 closed the day at 25,232.50, down 353 points or 25,232. BSE Sensex ended at 82,180.47, down 1,066 points or 1.28%.The selloff erased nearly Rs 9 lakh crore in investor wealth, pulling the total market capitalisation of BSE-listed companies down to about Rs 456 lakh crore.Technology shares were the biggest drag on the benchmarks, pushing indices to multi-month lows. The Nifty IT index dropped 2 percent to become the worst-performing sector, with all its constituents ending in negative territory.The subdued start to the earnings season has revived concerns about the pace of profit recovery, particularly for export-focused sectors such as information technology.“An area of concern is that early Q3 results do not indicate a recovery in earnings growth. This is likely to change when the results of auto companies start flowing in since this sector has done well in Q3 and it is heartening that the growth momentum is continuing in the sector,” said Dr.VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Investments.Global cues remained weak, adding further strain to domestic markets, as fresh tariff-related developments unsettled investor confidence worldwide. Risk appetite took a hit after renewed trade frictions resurfaced, with MSCI’s broad Asia-Pacific index excluding Japan slipping 0.3 percent. The decline followed comments from US President Donald Trump, who threatened new tariffs on eight European Union countries in an effort to press for greater US control over Greenland, a move that investors interpreted as reviving strains in transatlantic trade ties.The cautious mood extended to US markets as well, with futures on the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 sliding by around 1 percent. At the same time, the yield on the 10-year US Treasury climbed to 4.265 percent, its highest level since early September, reflecting lingering worries that interest rates could stay elevated for longer, even as the dollar continued to soften.Analysts expect near-term volatility to remain elevated until there is more clarity on the tariff dispute between the United States and Europe linked to Greenland. With both sides adopting firmer stances, uncertainty is likely to persist, said Dr. VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Investments. He noted that “a new development is possible today if a U.S. Supreme Court ruling on Trump-era tariffs goes against the President. However, there is no certainty on whether the ruling will come today. If it does, it could change the scenario completely overnight.”Meanwhile, sustained foreign selling continued to pressure equities, with overseas investors extending their net outflow streak to a tenth straight session. Foreign institutional investors sold shares worth nearly Rs 3,263 crore on Monday, January 19, reflecting ongoing caution amid heightened global trade and geopolitical risks.Purchases by domestic institutions provided some cushion but were insufficient to offset the broader selling pressure. Domestic institutional investors bought equities worth around Rs 4,234 crore on the same day, offering limited support even as benchmark indices continued to slide.A strong surge in precious metals reflected a clear shift towards risk aversion, with investors seeking refuge in traditional safe-haven assets as global trade tensions intensified. Gold prices crossed the $4,700-per-ounce mark for the first time on Tuesday, while silver stayed close to record highs, after US President Donald Trump’s renewed tariff threats against European partners further dented market sentiment worldwide.Spot gold climbed 1 percent to $4,717.03 an ounce by 0730 GMT, having earlier touched a record peak of $4,721.91. February gold futures in the US advanced 2.8 percent to $4,722.70 an ounce. Silver, after hitting an all-time high of $94.72 earlier in the session, eased slightly by 0.5 percent to $94.23 an ounce.Silver has begun 2026 with exceptional momentum, rising over 35 percent, or nearly Rs 85,000, in domestic markets, aided by tight supply conditions and heightened geopolitical risks involving the US, Iran and Greenland. The rally accelerated further this week after MCX silver futures broke above the key psychological level of Rs 3 lakh per kg. During Tuesday’s trade, prices jumped more than 2.5 percent, or close to Rs 8,000, to Rs 3,19,949 per kg.","Nifty50 and BSE Sensex crashed in trade on Tuesday, with a sharp selloff in the latter half of the session.

Trump’s Greenland push: US President would 100% tariff EU nations; ‘no comment’ on seizing by force,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/trumps-greenland-push-us-president-would-100-tariff-eu-nations-no-comment-on-seizing-by-force/articleshow/126769882.cms,"'Greenland Needs U.S.': Trump Aide Slams Europe’s ‘Weakness,’ Backs POTUS' Tariff War Threats

US President Donald Trump on Monday (local time) said that he would ""100%"" proceed with his plans to impose tariffs on European countries unless a deal over Greenland is reached. In a telephonic interview by NBC news, the US president was asked if he will seize the land by ""force,"" to which he replied, ""no comment. ""Trump also intensified his bid to seize control of Greenland from Denmark, a fellow Nato ally, prompting the European Union to consider potential countermeasures. The ongoing dispute also poses risk to destabilise the Nato alliance, which has long formed the backbone of Western security and is already under strain from the war in Ukraine and Trump’s position on allied defence spending, Reuters reported.The threat has unsettled European industry and sent tremors through financial markets amid fears of a return to the volatility seen during the 2025 trade war, which only eased after tariff agreements were struck mid-year.Trump’s remarks were supported by a text message he sent on Sunday to Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Stoere, linking his stance on Greenland to the Nobel Peace Prize decision. “Considering your Country decided not to give me the Nobel Peace Prize for having stopped 8 Wars PLUS, I no longer feel an obligation to think purely of Peace, although it will always be predominant, but can now think about what is good and proper for the United States of America,” Trump wrote.Norway’s government released the messages on Monday under the country’s freedom of information act. Stoere had first written on behalf of himself and Finnish President Alexander Stubb, urging de-escalation and proposing a call. Trump responded less than half an hour later.The Norwegian Nobel Committee awarded the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize to Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado, a decision that angered Trump.In his message, Trump repeated his claim that Denmark is incapable of protecting Greenland from Russia or China. “… And why do they have a ‘right of ownership’ anyway?” he wrote, adding: “The World is not secure unless we have Complete and Total Control of Greenland.”Last week on Saturday, Trump vowed to impose a rising wave of tariffs from February 1 on Denmark, Sweden, France, Germany, the Netherlands and Finland, as well as Britain and Norway, until the United States is allowed to buy Greenland, which has a population of about 57,000.“We are living in 2026, you can trade with people, but you don’t trade people,” Denmark’s Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said during a visit to London on Monday.Meanwhile, Greenland’s Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen said in a Facebook post that the territory must be free to determine its own future.“We will not let ourselves be pressured. We stand firm on dialogue, on respect and on international law,” he said.","US President Donald Trump said that he would ""100%"" proceed with his plans to impose tariffs on European countries unless a deal over Greenland is reached.

Budget 2026: Why standard deduction should be hiked under the new income tax regime,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/taxation/budget-2026-why-standard-deduction-should-be-hiked-under-the-new-income-tax-regime-explained/articleshow/126777401.cms,"Budget 2026 income tax expectations: The standard deduction limit varies depending on the tax regime that salaried taxpayers opt for. (AI image)



Budget 2026 income tax

expectations:

Latest Income Tax Slabs FY 2025–26 (Under New Income Tax Regime)

So, should the standard deduction limit be raised from Rs 75,000? Most tax experts surveyed by Times of India Online are of the view that a hike in standard deduction under the new income tax regime should be considered by the government.

Why Standard Deduction Should Be Hiked

What is Standard Deduction?

Why the government may not hike standard deduction limit

Why Standard Deduction Should Be Hiked & Why It May Not Be

Standard deduction is seen as a much needed relief for taxpayers - it’s a simple, straightforward deduction from your gross income - a fixed amount that allows salaried taxpayers and pensioners to reduce their tax outgo in a financial year. With the Union Budget 2026 set to be presented by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on February 1, taxpayers are wondering if this relief will see a hike, especially in the new income tax regime.One important point to note is that the standard deduction limit varies depending on the tax regime that salaried taxpayers opt for: under the old income tax regime it has stayed at Rs 50,000 for several years, and under the new income tax regime it was hiked to Rs 75,000 in 2024. As the government pushes for the adoption of the new income tax regime, any major changes including those in standard deduction limits, are expected only in that regime.Over the last few years, several income tax slab and rate changes have been introduced in the new regime to make it more attractive for salaried individuals.Last year, FM Sitharaman made income up to Rs 12 lakh tax free (Rs 12.75 lakh for salaried taxpayers who get the benefit of Rs 75,000 standard deduction).As per government data, for FY 2023-24, 72% of taxpayers had opted for the new regime - a figure that will likely go up after last year’s tax relief under the new regime.The case for a hike in standard deduction limits is simple: the new income tax regime does not offer benefits of most deductions and exemptions that are available under the old income tax regime. Hiking this limit will push more people to opt to the clutter-free new income tax regime. Some experts also advocate linking standard deduction limits to inflation, hence ensuring that the limit is in line with the rising cost of living.Preeti Sharma, Partner – Tax and Regulatory Services at BDO India tells TOI, “Under the new tax regime, salaried taxpayers currently enjoy a standard deduction of Rs 75,000, raised from Rs 50,000 in Budget 2025. This increase has provided some relief, especially since most exemptions and deductions are not available under the new tax regime. However, rising inflation and higher day-to-day expenses have reduced the disposable income of salaried households. A further increase in the standard deduction would help employees manage these rising costs.”Radhika Viswanathan, Executive Director at Deloitte India sees a case for standard deduction to be hiked to as much as Rs 1.25 lakh!“There is a strong case for further enhancing the standard deduction under the new tax regime since no other major deductions or exemptions are available to the salaried class. While the current limit stands at Rs 75,000, the government could consider increasing it to Rs 1 lakh to 1.25 lakh. An increase would provide meaningful relief, support middle-class taxpayers, and preserve the simplicity of the regime without reintroducing multiple deduction-linked compliances,” she tells TOI.Chander Talreja, Partner, Vialto Partners is of the view that the introduction of new labour codes may reduce take home pay, and an increase in standard deduction may help offset that.“This Budget will focus on how to further accelerate adoption of the new personal tax regime by the taxpayers. On the one hand, the scope for further rationalization of tax slabs or the introduction of reduced tax rates and additional rebates is limited, as these were revised last year only. On the other hand, introducing new deductions or exemptions under the new personal tax regime may not be feasible, given that the regime is designed to operate without such provisions, and any deviation could dilute its core objective,” he says.According to Talreja, this effectively leaves the government with one viable option - enhancement of the standard deduction. The existing limit is Rs 75,000 under the new personal tax regime which may be increased by at least Rs 15,000 to address rising cost-of-living pressures.“Moreover, the said increase in standard deduction may also be crucial with the introduction of the new Labour Codes. With the definition of “Wages” the contribution towards provident fund may go up which may consequently reduce the take-home pay for individuals. Some relief in the form of increased standard deduction may help to offset this impact,” he says.Tanu Gupta, Partner at Mainstay Tax Advisors LLP also finds merit in increasing the standard deduction limit. “In last year’s Budget, the government revised the income tax slabs under the new tax regime and enhanced the rebate under Section 87A, effectively providing tax relief for income up to Rs 12 lakh (Rs 12.75 lakh for salaried taxpayers). The objective was to increase disposable income, thereby boosting consumption. This was further supplemented during the year by reductions in GST on several items,” she tells TOI.However, the standard deduction, which was increased from Rs 50,000 to Rs 75,000 in Union Budget 2024 under the new tax regime, has since remained unchanged, she says.“There is merit in automatically adjusting this limit each year for inflation, in a manner similar to the government’s periodic revision of Dearness Allowance for its employees.Given the limited number of exemptions and deductions available under the new tax regime, such simplicity - combined with automatic inflation adjustment - would make the regime even more straightforward and taxpayer-friendly,” she adds.Parizad Sirwalla, Partner and Head, Global Mobility Services, Tax at KPMG in India is also of the view that since salaried taxpayers do not have any avenue to claim deduction for increased cost of living / other expenses (unlike a person earning business income) there is an ongoing expectation that the standard deduction is enhanced periodically keeping in mind the rate of inflation prevailing in the economy.However, some experts note that the government will have limited fiscal room to hike standard deduction after last year’s tax slab changes under the new income tax regime and sweeping GST rate cuts. There is also the rationale that the government may await data on how many taxpayers opt for the new tax regime as per FY 2025-26 slabs before looking to incentivise it further.Richa Sawhney, Partner, Tax at Grant Thornton Bharat explains that salaried taxpayers often feel that they end up paying more taxes than taxpayers with business income, due to limited avenues of deductions available from salary income.Standard deduction is one of the limited deductions available to salaried taxpayers, which aims to compensate them for employment‑related expenses, without requiring proof of claim.“Salaried taxpayers do feel that the current limit of Rs 75,000 is inadequate and a hike is surely on their budget wishlist . However, considering that the standard deduction was enhanced last year, increasing it further this year may not be feasible for the government. More-so, when the softening of gross non corporate tax collections is evident post the slab rate reforms carried out last year,” she says.Surabhi Marwah, Tax Partner, EY India also says that a further hike in the standard deduction appears unlikely in the near term. “In Budget 2024, the government increased the standard deduction under the new tax regime to Rs 75,000 for salaried taxpayers, while the old regime continues to offer Rs 50,000. This differential already provides a clear incentive for taxpayers to shift to the new regime,” she tells TOI.“With the Income-tax Act 2025 focusing on structural simplification, the priority now seems to be on wider adoption of the revised framework rather than introducing additional reliefs,” she adds.","The Union Budget 2026 is set to be presented by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on February 1. Standard deduction limit varies depending on the tax regime that salaried taxpayers opt for. The existing limit is Rs 75,000 under the new personal tax regime.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126777554,imgsize-41648,width-400,resizemode-4/budget-2026-income-tax.jpg"

are touching new record highs due to heightened geopolitical tensions, says Praveen Singh, Senior Fundamental Research Analyst- Currencies and Commodities at Mirae Asset Sharekhan.

Here’s his outlook on gold prices:

Gold Performance:

In the week ending January 16, the spot gold surged nearly 2% to close at $4595. The rally in the week came on the heels of a sharp 4.6% rise in the week ending January 9.

Driven by safe haven demand as the US President on January 17 threatened 8 EU nations with 10% tariffs beginning February 1 in retaliation to their opposition to his Greenland plans, the yellow metal extended its rally to a fresh record high of $4690 on January 19.

At the time of writing this article, the shiny metal was changing hands at $4672 (MCX February contract Rs 145,500), up 1.67% for the day.

ETF and COMEX gold inventory:

As of January 16, total known global gold ETF holdings stood at 99.86 MOz, highest since August 2022, and are up nearly 1% YTD, as holdings rose for the second straight week.

Registered COMEX gold inventory at 18.86 MOz, is up around 1 MOz from the cycle low of 17.86 MOz but is down over 22% from the record peak of 24.25 MOz seen on April 7.

The US Dollar Index fell around 0.15% to 99.08 on January 19 after rising for three straight weeks.Two-year and ten-year treasury yields jumped nearly 2% last week as the US President expressed doubt over the appointment of Kevin Hassett, a key proponent of lower rate policy. Trump wants to keep him at the White House.The US Bond market was closed on January 19 to observe Martin Luther King Jr Holiday.Trump rattled NATO allies over the weekend after threatening to impose 10% tariffs on 8 EU nations starting February 1 if he doesn’t get control of Greenland.Tariffs will be increased to 25% from June 1. The proposed tariff will be due and payable until a deal is reached for complete and total purchase of Greenland.US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that Europe was too weak to ensure Greenland’s security in an interview on Sunday.International Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said it’s too early to gauge the economic impact of tensions over Greenland, though it could be a headwind for growth.EU ambassadors met on Sunday to discuss options if Trump follows through with his threats. They are considering €93 billion ($108 billion) worth of American goods. The bloc’s leaders are due to meet for an emergency summit on Thursday.The European Union is once again weighing whether to use its most powerful economic weapon — the anti-coercion instrument (ACI) — in a dispute with a major trading partner. The instrument allows the EU to deploy an array of measures in response to coercive trade tactics. It may include new fees on EU imports of US goods and services, curbs on US investments in Europe or a ban on American firms bidding for public contracts.The pending US Supreme Court ruling on some of Trump’s earlier tariffs may come as soon as Tuesday.President Trump will address the annual World Economic Forum in Davos this week and may offer details of home ownership plans for helping Americans buy homes by making it possible to take money out of their 401(K)s and use that for downpayment.Bloomberg reported that respondents in a World Economic Forum survey identify 'geoeconomic confrontation' and 'state-based armed conflict' as the two biggest risks to the global backdrop in 2026.As per Axios, the US officials plan to focus on economic growth, home ownership and peace through strength at WEF, Davos.China’s data released on January 19 showed that China’s economy grew 4.5% on an annualized basis in Q4 2025 vs 4.4% expected. China’s retail sales hit a 3-year low in December, trailing the forecast. Similarly, China’s industrial production, fixed asset investment (December) trailed their respective forecasts.Last week’s data showed that US CPI (December), despite expectations of coming out to be hot on downward adjustments in the November CPI data, was tame. CPI y-o-y was up 2.7% (forecast 2.7%, prior 2.7%). The core CPI also rose 2.7% y-o-y (forecast 2.7%, prior 2.7%). Retail sales advance was up 0.6% m-o-m Vs the estimate of 0.5% and prior reading of -0.1%), while retail sales control group up 0.4% (forecast 0.4%, prior 0.6%).PPI final demand data were hotter than expected though.Industrial production data, released on Friday, was up 0.4% m-o-m (forecast 0.1%) in December.Major US data on the deck this week include 3Q GDP final reading (January 22), real personal spending (January 22), PCE Price Index (January 22) and S&P Global US PMIs, University of Michigan consumer sentiment and inflation expectations (January 23).Major Eurozone data to be released this week include CPI (January 19), services and composite PMIs (January 23). The UK’s CPI (January 21), services and composite PMIs (January 23) will also be monitored by investors.Fresh escalation in geopolitical tensions over Greenland as Trump threatens the EU nations with tariffs to achieve his goal is an unexpected development which is supporting gold prices. Heightened worries and repercussions may also affect global trade and economy. Otherwise, gold could have come under pressure due to diminishing possibility of Hassett becoming the next Fed Chair, a firmer US Dollar and thawing geopolitical tensions as Iran strike had been averted.Still, US Supreme Court ruling over Trump’s tariffs may create huge short-term volatility as his tariffs may be lacking legal basis, though the Trump Administration could resort to other clauses to keep most of the tariffs in place.Trump extending the EU tariff deadline will also weigh on the yellow metal.Spot gold may test resistance around $4750 (MCX February contract Rs 148,000) amid elevated US-EU tariff tensions.However, considering the risks involved, buyers are urged to exercise caution and to put suitable stoploss. Support is at $4608 (Rs 143,500)/$4560 (Rs 142,000). Interim resistance is at $4707 (Rs 146,500).Spot silver surged over 12% in the week ending January 16 as it closed at $89.94 on January 16.Shanghai Gold Exchange Silver price (T+D) at 23271 CNY/Kg is equivalent to around $104/Oz.US imposing tariffs on EU means that the expected flow of silver inventories from COMEX warehouses to LBMA warehouses will be disrupted, which will tighten the spot market.Spot silver, currently at $94.42 (MCX March contract Rs 309,660), up nearly 5% for the day, is expected to trade with a positive bias that will strengthen should the metal closes above $94 mark for two straight days. It may rise to test the resistance zone of $98-$100 (MCX March contract Rs 321,000-Rs 328,000). However, as mentioned earlier in the gold section, utmost caution is needed with a suitable stoploss in place. Support is at $90 (Rs 295,000)/$86 (Rs 282,000).","Gold prices touching new record highs due to heightened geopolitical tensions, says Praveen Singh, Senior Fundamental Research Analyst- Currencies and Commodities at Mirae Asset Sharekhan.

Stock market today: Weighed down by weak global cues, Indian equity benchmarks Nifty50 and BSE Sensex , opened in red on Wednesday after over 1% declines in the Tuesday session. While Nifty50 was below 25,100, BSE Sensex dropped almost 700 points. At 10:45 AM, Nifty50 was trading at 25,035.10, down 197.40 points or 0.78%. BSE Sensex was at 81,484.46, down 696.01 points or 0.85%.Market analysts see scope for a short-term technical rebound and they are of the view that even though the intraday market texture is weak, it is at present oversold. In that sense, a pullback rally may be on the cards, they say.Dr. VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Investments Limited says, “There is risk-off sentiment in global markets now in response to Trump’s Greenland policy, the threatened tariffs on eight European countries and Europe’s hardening anti-Trump stance. Globally stock markets are down and the flight to the safety of gold is up. There is no clarity on how the situation will evolve. If the threatened tariffs come into effect, Europe will retaliate and this will lead to a trade war with bad consequences for global trade and global growth. If such a scenario plays out stock markets will witness further selling.”“On the other hand, if Trump chickens out as he had done in the past, or succumbs to pressure, markets will rebound.A combined and united Europe has many options like the much talked about ‘Sell America’ wherein they sell US treasuries leading to sharp fall in dollar. This will hurt Trump. Public opinion in the US is also against Trump’s Greenland annexation plan. Many unexpected developments can happen and the market is likely to react strongly to the developments. Investors can watch and wait for normalcy and stability to return. Fairly-valued largecap stocks, particularly in banking, are likely to remain resilient.""Asian markets traded lower on Wednesday, tracking sharp losses on Wall Street as escalating trade tensions between the United States and Europe over Greenland unsettled investors and heightened volatility across global bond markets. The risk-off mood pushed gold to a fresh record high, while equities remained under pressure.Overnight in the US, all three major Wall Street indices registered their steepest single-day fall in three months. The selloff was driven by renewed concerns that President Donald Trump’s latest tariff threats against Europe could reignite global market instability and deepen trade-related uncertainty.Commodities also reflected the cautious sentiment. West Texas Intermediate crude prices slipped on Wednesday as worries over geopolitical risks and expectations of a rise in US crude inventories outweighed the impact of a temporary production halt at two major oilfields in Kazakhstan.In Indian markets, foreign portfolio investors continued to pare exposure, selling equities worth Rs 2,938 crore on Tuesday. Domestic institutional investors provided partial support, with net purchases of Rs 3,666 crore, though this was insufficient to offset broader risk aversion.","Nifty50 and BSE Sensex opened in red on Wednesday after over 1% declines in the Tuesday session.

EU Boss VDL Warns 'Tariffs A Mistake', Signals De-dollarisation

Short-term jitters or a longer mood swing?

Wall street took a sharp hit on Tuesday, plunging to their steepest single-day losses in three months, as investors reacted to US President Donald Trump's fresh tariff threats targeting Europe. The move sparked a widespread risk-off selloff across asset classes, triggering concerns about another round of market volatility.All three major US indices posted their worst daily performance since October 10, last year. While the S&P 500 dropped 143.15 points, or 2.06%, to close at 6,796.86, Nasdaq Composite tumbled 561.07 points, or 2.39%, to 22,954.32. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 870.74 points, or 1.76%, settling at 48,488.59.Both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq ended the session below their 50-day moving averages, Reuters reported.The impact was not limited to just equities. In other asset classes, gold climbed to fresh record highs as investors rushed towards safer assets, while US Treasuries came under renewed selling pressure, pushing borrowing costs higher. Bitcoin, which usually benefits during periods of market stress, declined more than 3%.Tuesday marked the first chance for US investors to react to Trump’s weekend remarks, as markets were closed on Monday for Martin Luther King, Jr Day. Trump said that additional 10% import tariffs would be imposed from February 1 on goods from Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Finland and Great Britain, all countries already facing US tariffs. He further added that the levies would rise to 25% from June 1 and remain in place until the US reached a deal to purchase Greenland.Meanwhile, leaders in Greenland, an autonomous territory of Denmark, and Denmark have maintained that the island is not for sale.The return of tariff-related uncertainty was similar to market disruptions seen earlier in April, during what was referred to as “Liberation Day”, when Trump’s trade measures against global partners pushed the S&P 500 close to bear market territory.The CBOE Volatility Index, a measure that indicates market fear, jumped to 20.09 points, its highest closing level since November 24. Trading activity also accelerated, with almost 20.6 billion shares changing hands on US exchanges, well above the 20-day average of 17.01 billion.In India, the NSE and BSE benchmarks also ended the day in red, falling over 1% each, erroding investors of almost Rs 9.86 lakh crore. While Nifty50 slid 1.38% to close at 25,232.5, Sensex fell 1,065.71 points, or 1.28%, to settle at 82,180.47.Elsewhere, on Wednesday, Asian stocks also showed losses for a third session, amid ongoing geopolitical tensions.While investor sentiment was clearly strained, questions remain over whether the sharp reaction is a short-lived response or signals deeper market implications.Jamie Cox, managing partner at Harris Financial Group, said he was not seeing evidence of investors exiting the market. ""I'm not at the point yet where I'm willing to say what is happening with Greenland, and the resurgence of the tariff threat back and forth, is going to precipitate a correction in the equities markets,"" he told Reuters. The expert further added that he would be surprised if markets fell by 3% to 5% this week.Cox pointed instead to developments in bond markets as a potentially more significant risk. Japanese government bonds fell sharply on Tuesday, sending yields to record highs, while Tokyo stocks and the yen weakened after Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi called for a snap election, raising concerns over Japan’s fiscal health. The moves contributed to higher yields on longer-dated European government bonds, while selling pressure in US Treasuries was more pronounced at the long end of the curve.Despite the renewed tariff threats and volatility across bond markets, the US economy continues to show strength. Investors are set to receive a series of economic indicators this week, including an update to third-quarter GDP, January PMI data and the Personal Consumption Expenditures report, the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation measure.The earnings season is also gathering momentum, with several major companies due to report results. Netflix was among those in focus, ending the session 0.8% lower ahead of its quarterly earnings announcement after market close.","All three major US indices posted their worst daily performance since October 10, last year.

Deloitte Partner Says Budget Must Fix GST Gaps, Cut Costs, Boost Domestic Manufacturing

From Credit Expansion to Risk Sharing

Liquidity Is the Binding Constraint

Expanding the Tax Base by Valuing Compliance

Strengthening India’s Financial Framework

(Manish Shah is MD & CEO of Godrej Capital)

India’s financial system has crossed an important threshold. Access to credit is no longer the binding constraint it once was. Today, households and enterprises that want credit can largely obtain it. The more relevant question now is whether the terms of finance such as the cost, tenure, liquidity, and risk sharing are aligned with the kind of long-term growth India is aiming for.Capital is available, but decision-making has become more deliberate. Borrowers are not stepping back from finance, they are weighing certainty, affordability, and long-horizon comfort far more carefully than before.That is where Budget thinking for 2026 and beyond can play a catalyst for higher and more inclusive growth.The next phase is not about simply pushing more credit into the system. It is about reducing the friction and cost around long-term borrowing without weakening discipline. The most effective way to do that is through deepening the market.Well-designed guarantee and co-lending frameworks that are built on models like CGTMSE that allow risk to be distributed more efficiently between the government and lenders.When risk is shared intelligently, the cost of credit falls naturally. This creates space for longer tenures, smoother repayment structures, and greater borrower confidence, especially for MSMEs and first-time formal borrowers.Lower cost of credit, however, cannot be sustained without adequate liquidity. India’s financial system needs stronger, more stable domestic funding. Yet household savings have increasingly migrated toward equity, not always by choice, but because tax structures favour it. Fixed-income instruments, particularly fixed deposits, need renewed relevance in household portfolios.Alongside, targeted tax benefits for fixed-income savings can deepen liquidity, strengthen Current Account and Savings Account (CASA) growth, and lower system-wide funding costs. This is not about discouraging equity participation, but about restoring balance so asset allocation reflects suitability rather than tax distortion.A similar principle applies to household wealth locked in real estate.Real estate remains the single largest repository of personal wealth in India, yet capital mobility from property into financial assets remains constrained. Allowing proceeds from real estate sales to be deployed into financial instruments at lower capital gains tax rates would unlock liquidity already within the system. This would let households rebalance portfolios as their needs evolve, freeing capital for productive use rather than locking it in illiquid assets.As we unlock liquidity, we must also broaden the tax base - through encouragement, not only enforcement.Tax compliance improves when it is visibly valued. High-compliance taxpayers contribute disproportionately to fiscal capacity yet often feel least acknowledged. Combining compliance with tangible benefits such as dedicated service lines, straight through approvals wherever feasible, faster immigration or visa support, and premium government interfaces can restore the prestige of paying tax. The goal is simple: make formal and higher participation feel rewarding, not merely obligatory, and visibly recognize those who contribute most.Taken together, these ideas point to a common theme. India does not need a larger financial system. It needs a system where liquidity is deeper, risk is shared more effectively, capital moves more freely, and compliance is aspirational.Budgets that enable these shifts may not announce themselves loudly, but they shape economic behaviour in lasting ways.That is the kind of financial architecture India can benefit from in its next phase of growth.",India’s financial system has crossed an important threshold. Access to credit is no longer the binding constraint it once was. The next phase is not about pushing more credit into the system. It is about reducing the friction and cost around long-term borrowing.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126837025,imgsize-501286,width-400,resizemode-4/budget-2026-expectations.jpg"

Union minister Ashwini Vaishnaw on Wednesday clarified that while India remains engaged with major global powers, the World Economic Forum (WEF) at Davos is largely a platform for the exchange of ideas rather than a venue for formal group-to-group trade negotiations.Responding to a query on whether India would hold meetings with the US delegation at the forum, Vaishnaw said, ""The format of Davos is a format where we generally do panels and bilaterals. The trade meetings take place according to the country's own schedules and negotiations. They are deeply engaged with all the major economies on practically all fronts at this point in time.

NEW DELHI: The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) exposure to the equity market has for the first time reached 10%, as the retirement fund body looks for avenues to augment its income to sustain the persistent high annual returns amid falling govt bond yields, where nearly 85% of its investible corpus is parked.""EPFO is allowed to invest its fresh accretions only into the equity market. We remain committed to investing more in equities and the 10% threshold has just been reached,"" an official told TOI.The retirement fund body is currently allowed to invest up to 15% of the fresh flows into equities.For FY25, EPFO had declared an interest rate of 8.25% on members' EPF balances, while the average yield on 10-year govt securities was 6.86%. The Nifty50 and BSE sensex returned 5.3% and 5.1%, respectively.EPFO invests in the equity market only through exchange traded funds (ETFs) based on the S&P BSE sensex and National Stock Exchange Nifty50 and started investing 5% of fresh accretions in Aug 2015.

(AP Photo/Jae C. Hong, File)

Netflix capped last year with another solid financial performance despite slowing subscriber growth that underscored the importance of its contested $72 billion bid to take over Warner Bros. ' movie studio and slot HBO Max into its video streaming line-up.The fourth-quarter results announced Tuesday eclipsed the projections of stock market analysts, but Netflix's report also noted that the video service ended the year with more than 325 million worldwide subscribers, a figure indicating it has added about 23 million subscribers since 2024.The 2025 subscriber increase marked a dramatic slowdown from the 41 million picked up during 2024, amplifying investor worries that Netflix's growth has peaked since the 2022 introduction of a low-priced, advertising-supported version of its service that triggered a massive surge in subscribers.Management also forecast a profit for the January-March period that was below analysts' predictions and announced Netflix would stop buying back its own stock while trying to complete the Warner Bros' deal. Even though its ad sales are expected to double, Netflix also projected its revenue growth would taper off from 16% in 2025 to 12% to 14% this year.""Overall, this points to a challenging start to the year,"" said Investing.com analyst Thomas Monteiro.Netflix's shares sank nearly 5% in extended trading, even though its profit and revenue for the past quarter were better than anticipated. The company earned $2.4 billion, or 56 cents per share, 29% increase from the same time in the previous year. Revenue rose 18% from the previous year to more than $12 billion.The results almost seemed like a footnote next to the stakes involved in Netflix's bidding war to buy Warner Bros. Discovery .The battle took another turn earlier Tuesday when Netflix converted its original offer that included a stock component into an all-cash deal in hopes of simplifying the process and making it easier for Warner Bros. Discovery shareholders to resist Paramount's overtures.Although Warner Bros. has reiterated its commitment to getting the Netflix deal done, Paramount isn't showing any signs of backing down and could still sweeten its counteroffer to turn up the heat another notch.Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos seemed to send a warning shot across Paramount's bow during a Tuesday conference call as he recalled fending off rivals such as Walmart and the now-vanquished Blockbuster video chain during the company's days as a DVD-by-mail rental service. ""We are no strangers to competition and we are now strangers to change,"" Sarandos said.Besides having to fend off Paramount, Netflix will also need to persuade U.S. regulators that adding HBO to a streaming service that has the most subscribers in the country won't stifle competition and drive up prices that have already been rising in recent years.The uncertainty has been reflected in Netflix's stock price, which has fallen by20% since its agreement with Warner Bros. Discovery was unveiled last month. It's a cloud likely to hang over Netflix through most of this year because the company doesn't expect to complete its purchase until Warner Bros. Discovery spins off its cable TV business - a process expected to take six to nine months.""We are energized as ever to achieve our mission to entertain the world,"" Sarandos said.","Netflix ended the year with more than 325 million worldwide subscribers, a figure indicating it has added about 23 million subscribers since 2024. The 2025 subscriber increase marked a dramatic slowdown from the 41 million picked up during 2024.

Trump's Greenland Threat Backfires? EU Boss VDL Warns 'Tariffs A Mistake', Signals De-dollarisation

The European Parliament is planning to suspend approval of the EU-US trade deal agreed last July in response to President Donald Trump’s threat to impose new tariffs on European nations over Greenland.The decision is expected to be formally announced in Strasbourg on Wednesday, signaling heightened tensions between Washington and its European allies, according to the BBC.The July 2025 trade deal, struck at Trump’s golf course in Scotland, reduced US tariffs on European goods to 15% from the 30% initially threatened in April, in exchange for European investments in the US and measures to boost American exports.The voting was initially scheduled for January 26-27, where lawmakers were expected to remove tariffs on US industrial goods under the deal. However, influential European Parliament members, including Manfred Weber of the European People’s Party, said approval is not possible at this stage following Trump’s weekend tariff threats.Trump has warned of 10 per cent tariff from February 1 on goods from Denmark, Sweden, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Finland, the UK, and Norway until the US is allowed to acquire Greenland, a self-governing territory of Denmark.European officials condemned the US move as coercive. French foreign minister Jean-Noel Barrot said that the threat of customs duties “is being used as blackmail to obtain unjustifiable concessions”.He added that the European Commission has “very powerful instruments” to respond. In a post on social media, he emphasized that France remains committed to security cooperation with the US but is prepared to reject unacceptable proposals, according to Reuters.The tariff threat has revived fears of a trade war, rattling global markets. European stock indices fell for a second consecutive day on Tuesday, while the Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq were down more than 1% in early US trading. On currency markets, the euro climbed 0.8% to $1.1742 and the pound rose 0.2% to $1.346, while the US dollar slipped sharply.The EU had previously held off retaliatory measures against US tariffs worth €93 billion ($109 billion), scheduled to resume on February 7 unless an agreement or extension is reached.Denmark, backed by the EU, has stressed diplomatic channels remain open despite the strong stance.Danish Foreign Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen said, “The US is also more than the president. Checks and balances exist in American society.”Meanwhile, French President Emmanuel Macron and Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni have voiced readiness to defend Greenland, with Meloni describing Trump’s threat as a “mistake.”","The European Parliament is planning to suspend approval of the EU-US trade deal agreed last July in response to President Donald Trump’s threat to impose new tariffs on European nations.

Trump's Greenland Threat Backfires? EU Boss VDL Warns 'Tariffs A Mistake', Signals De-dollarisation

US stocks dropped sharply in morning trading on Tuesday after President Donald Trump threatened to impose new tariffs on eight NATO members. The move has escalated geopolitical tensions over his push to assert American control over Greenland.The sell-off marked the first opportunity for markets to react to the latest escalation, after U.S. exchanges were closed on Monday for the Martin Luther King Jr. Day holiday.At around 10.04 am ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 682 points, or 1.5%. The S&P 500 fell 1.5%, retreating further from the record high it had touched early last week, while the Nasdaq Composite slid 1.7%, weighed down by losses in heavyweight technology stocks, news agency AP reported.Losses were broad-based across sectors. Technology stocks led the decline, reflecting their outsized influence on market movements. Nvidia dropped 3.2%, Amazon fell 2.7%, JPMorgan Chase declined 1.9%, and Caterpillar lost 1.3%.Retailers, banks and industrial companies also traded sharply lower. The energy sector was a rare gainer, supported by higher crude prices, with Exxon Mobil rising 1.5%.The market downturn followed Trump’s announcement over the weekend that the United States would impose a 10% import tax from February on goods from Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Finland.The annual combined imports from European Union nations exceed those from the US’s two largest individual import sources, Mexico and China, underscoring the potential economic impact of a prolonged trade standoff.Trump linked the tariff threat to opposition from European countries to his desire to bring Greenland, a self-governing territory of NATO member Denmark under US control.He also tied his aggressive stance to Norway’s decision last year not to award him the Nobel Peace Prize, saying in a text message to Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre that he no longer felt “an obligation to think purely of Peace.”His remarks appeared to intensify a standoff between Washington and its closest allies, triggering outrage and a flurry of diplomatic activity across Europe. European leaders are weighing possible countermeasures, including retaliatory tariffs and the first-ever use of the European Union’s anti-coercion instrument.European markets fell sharply for a second straight session, while Asian markets also ended lower. In Asia, Japan’s Nikkei 225 dropped 1.1%, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng slipped 0.3%, South Korea’s Kospi fell 0.4%, Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 lost 0.7%, Taiwan’s Taiex gained 0.4%, and India’s Sensex declined 0.8%.Investors sought safety amid rising uncertainty, pushing precious metals to fresh highs. Gold surged 3.2% to a record level, while silver soared 7%, with both assets benefiting from heightened demand for safe havens during geopolitical turmoil.In the bond market, Treasury yields were mixed. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury rose to 4.28% from 4.23% late Friday, while the two-year yield edged down to 3.59% from 3.60%.

Bid battle escalates: Netflix revises Warner Bros acquisition; offers all-cash deal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/bid-battle-escalates-netflix-revises-warner-bros-acquisition-offers-all-cash-deal/articleshow/126811679.cms,"AP images

Netflix Drops A $72b Bombshell On Hollywood With Mega Warner Bros Discovery Move | WHAT IT MEANS

Netflix has revised its proposed acquisition of Warner Bros. Discovery, shifting to an all-cash transaction valued at USD 27.75 per share. The move aims at simplifying the deal structure and strengthening its position amid rival takeover efforts.The revised offer values Warner Bros. Discovery at an enterprise value of about USD 82.7 billion, including debt and replaces Netflix’s earlier cash-and-stock proposal.Netflix and Warner Bros. said on Tuesday that the amended structure is intended to provide greater certainty of value to shareholders and accelerate the path to a shareholder vote, according to Reuters.Under the revised agreement, Warner Bros. Discovery shareholders will receive USD 27.75 per share in cash. In addition, they will retain exposure to Discovery Global, a planned spin-off that will house television assets such as CNN, TNT Sports and the Discovery+ streaming service. Both companies said their boards have unanimously approved the amended all-cash deal.Netflix has been locked in a takeover tussle with Paramount Skydance, which has pursued a rival bid for Warner Bros. and last week escalated its efforts by announcing plans to nominate its own slate of directors ahead of the next shareholder meeting.Paramount has argued that its offer is superior, but Warner Bros. has repeatedly rejected that claim.Explaining the rationale behind the revised offer, Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos said that the new structure would help move the deal forward faster.“Our revised all-cash agreement will enable an expedited timeline to a stockholder vote and provide greater financial certainty,” Sarandos said in a statement.Netflix’s move comes without increasing the overall valuation of the deal, in what analysts see as an attempt to shut the door on Paramount’s competing bid.The earlier offer comprised USD 23.25 in cash and USD 4.50 in Netflix stock, a structure that came under pressure after Netflix shares fell nearly 15 per cent since the merger announcement in early December.In a regulatory filing, Warner Bros. said that the revised terms offer shareholders immediate liquidity and reduced risk.“The merger consideration is a fixed cash amount to be paid by an investment-grade company, providing stockholders with certainty of value and liquidity immediately upon closing,” the company said.Warner Bros. also disclosed details of its valuation for Discovery Global, which shareholders will own separately following the split. Advisers estimated a wide valuation range for the spinoff, from as low as USD 1.33 per share to as high as USD 6.86 per share, depending on future deal activity. Paramount has dismissed the spinoff’s value, calling it effectively worthless.Market reaction was mixed. Netflix shares rose about 1.2–1.3 per cent before the opening bell, while Warner Bros Discovery shares were little changed. Paramount shares slipped around 1 per cent.The competing bids are expected to come to a head later this year when Warner Bros. shareholders vote on the proposed transaction.Paramount Skydance’s tender offer, which expires on January 21, has so far failed to win board support. A Delaware court recently rejected Paramount’s attempt to force faster disclosures related to Warner Bros.’ cable TV assets.Analysts say that the shareholder approval may only be the first hurdle, as lawmakers across the political spectrum have raised concerns that further consolidation in the media industry could reduce competition and consumer choice.Nonetheless, Netflix has argued that its larger scale, investment-grade credit rating and lower leverage profile make its offer more attractive than Paramount’s.With control of Warner Bros.’ prized studios, streaming assets and franchises such as Game of Thrones, Harry Potter and DC Comics at stake, the battle for the Hollywood giant is shaping up to be one of the most closely watched media deals of the year.","Netflix has revised its proposed acquisition of Warner Bros.

Xi 'SCOLDS' Trump For Using China To Stoke Greenland Fear | US' Arctic Power Play Backfires?

China on Tuesday said there were no winners in trade and tariff wars and called for more cooperation and dialogue in the global economy.Speaking at the World Economic Forum annual meeting, China’s vice-premier He Lifeng said countries should work together instead of turning inward. He added that while economic globalisation had flaws, nations could completely reject it or move towards self-isolation.Lifeng further said that China would “open its door wider to the world” and the country planned to expand its market, with a focus on the services sector.He also spoke about China’s economic progress and said domestic demand had been placed at the centre of the country’s economic agenda for 2026. The aim, he said, is to boost consumption while maintaining China’s production strength.The remarks come at a time of rising global trade tensions following the trade war launched by US President Donald Trump during his second term.China earlier said its economy grew by 5 per cent last year, meeting its official target. Growth was supported by a record trade surplus, even though the economy slowed to 4.5 per cent in the final three months of 2025.Over the past year, China has faced challenges in boosting domestic spending, a prolonged property crisis, and disruption linked to US tariff policies under President Trump.Trump, who began his second term on January 20, 2025, has expanded tariffs as part of efforts to protect US industries and reduce trade deficits.In the latest move, Trump has announced 10 per cent tariffs on imports from eight European countries Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Finland. The tariffs, set to take effect from February 1, 2026, were linked to his demand for the “complete and total purchase of Greenland”.Trump said the tariffs would remain until a deal was reached. His remarks followed reports that some European countries had sent troops to Greenland in support of Denmark.","China’s vice-premier He Lifeng said countries should work together instead of turning inward.

EU Puts India At Core Of Historic Trade Reset At Davos, Ursula Leyen Terms It 'Mother Of All Deals'

India is close to signing a trade deal with the European Union, as stated by EU chief Ursula von der Leyen during the World Economic Forum in Davos on Tuesday.""There is still work to do. But we are on the cusp of a historic trade agreement. Some call it the mother of all deals. One that would create a market of 2 billion people, accounting for almost a quarter of global GDP,"" she said while outlining the EU’s push to expand and diversify its trade partnerships.She also linked the trade push to forthcoming high-level engagement, saying she will visit India next weekend following the World Economic Forum in Davos. She said the trip is aimed at advancing the proposed trade agreement and underscored that significant work remains to bolster economic ties and deepen cooperation between Europe and India. Von der Leyen is among the chief guests for the 77th Republic Day celebrations. During the India visit, the Eu chief, alongside president of the European Council Antonio Luis Santos da Costa , will also co-chair the 16th India-EU Summit on January 27.Talking about the proposed agreement with India within Europe’s broader global strategy, von der Leyen said the continent remains open to doing business with partners across the world and will continue to pursue active engagement.“Europe will always choose the world, and the world is ready to choose Europe,” she said, emphasising the EU’s determination to expand international trade and cooperation.Last week, Commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal had also said the free trade agreement between India and EU, where negotiations are in the final phase, will be the ""mother of all deals"" signed by the country so far. ""I have done seven deals so far. All with developed economies. This one will be the mother of all,"" the union minister said.He added that, ""we are getting a super deal. In areas of EU interest also, we are giving them a super deal. It has to be a win-win. The good part is we do not compete with each other. We have different interests.""Before Goyal, commerce secretary Rajesh Agrawal said the two sides had completed negotiations on 20 of the 24 chapters, with efforts ongoing to conclude the talks by January 26.","EU Puts India At Core Of Historic Trade Reset At Davos, Ursula Leyen Terms It 'Mother Of All Deals' She will visit India next weekend following the World Economic Forum in Davos.

The US has cautioned European countries against retaliatory tariffs linked to President Donald Trump’s threatened levies over Greenland, with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent describing such a response as ill-advised.Speaking to reporters on the opening day of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Bessent said any retaliatory move by Europe would be “very unwise”, according to an AFP report.Asked about reports that Trump, in a message to Norway’s prime minister, appeared to link his bid to control Greenland with not having won the Nobel Peace Prize, Bessent said he was unaware of any such correspondence.“I don’t know anything about the president’s letter to Norway,” he told reporters on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos. He added, however, “I think it’s a complete canard that the president will be doing this because of the Nobel Prize.”Trump said over the weekend that from February 1, a group of European countries — Britain, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden — would face a 10 per cent tariff on all goods exported to the United States. The tariffs, he said, would remain in place until Denmark agrees to cede Greenland.The announcement has triggered sharp reactions across Europe, with several US allies accusing Washington of economic coercion. German Vice Chancellor Lars Klingbeil said on Monday that Europe was preparing countermeasures in response to the proposed tariffs.Bessent cautioned European governments against escalating the dispute, reiterating his earlier warning that retaliatory tariffs would be “very unwise”. He said Trump viewed Greenland as a strategic asset vital to US security interests, arguing that Washington would not “outsource” its hemispheric security.Bessent said Trump’s interest in Greenland stems from its strategic importance. The US president views the autonomous Danish territory as a critical asset for national and hemispheric security, he said.“We are not going to outsource our hemispheric security to anyone else,” Bessent said, explaining Washington’s stance amid rising transatlantic trade tensions.Trump had for months insisted that the US should control Greenland, a position that has unsettled European Union capitals and raised the prospect of a fresh tariff confrontation between Washington and Europe.","Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent says any retaliatory move by Europe would be “very unwise” Trump said over the weekend that a group of European countries would face a 10 per cent tariff on all goods exported to the United States.

Cryptocurrencies fell sharply on Monday as US President Donald Trump ’s threat to impose new tariffs on eight European countries rattled risk assets and boosted demand for safe-haven assets.

'NATO Unbeatable, Tariffs A Mistake': Meloni BREAKS Ranks With Trump On Greenland | WATCH

US stock futures fell on Monday as markets reacted to President Donald Trump’s threat to impose additional tariffs on eight European countries. This comes after Washington has demanded to purchase Greenland, a move that has fuelled fears of a wider transatlantic trade conflict.S&P 500 futures slid about 0.7%, while Nasdaq futures fell 1.0% in thin trading, as US equity and bond markets were closed for a holiday. The dollar weakened against traditional safe-haven currencies, slipping against the Japanese yen and the Swiss franc, according to Reuters.Gold and silver climbed to record highs as investors sought safety, while oil prices eased amid concerns that an escalating trade dispute between the United States and Europe could hurt global growth and demand.In Europe, market sentiment was also weaker. EUROSTOXX 50 and Germany’s DAX futures were both down 1.1%. In Asia, Japan’s Nikkei index fell 1.0%, while MSCI’s broad index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan edged 0.1% lower.Trump said that he would impose additional 10% import tariffs from February 1 on goods from Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Finland and Britain. He added that the duties would rise to 25% from June 1 if no agreement is reached.Major European Union countries condemned the tariff threat, describing it as an attempt at economic coercion linked to Greenland.EU options include retaliatory tariffs on €93 billion ($108 billion) worth of US imports, which were approved last year but suspended for six months in early August, as well as steps under the bloc’s Anti-Coercion Instrument. The latter could target the US services trade or investments.Analysts at Deutsche Bank said European countries hold around $8 trillion in US bonds and equities, nearly twice as much as the rest of the world combined, and could consider repatriating some of those investments.“With the US net international investment position ⁠at record negative extremes, the mutual interdependence of European-US financial markets has never been higher,” said George Saravelos, the bank’s global head of foreign exchange research.He warned that using capital flows as leverage would be far more disruptive to markets than tariffs alone.The standoff is also expected to overshadow discussions at the World Economic Forum in Davos this week, where leaders from around the world will gather, including a large US delegation led by Trump.In Asia, investors were awaiting Chinese economic data due later on Monday, with growth expected to slow to 4.4% in the December quarter from 4.8% previously, as weak domestic demand offsets strength in exports and manufacturing.Attention is also on the Bank of Japan’s policy meeting on Friday. While no interest rate hike is expected, policymakers may signal a possible tightening as early as April. Political uncertainty is adding to the backdrop, with Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi expected to dissolve parliament ahead of a February election.In the United States, delayed data on core inflation and consumer spending for November, due on Thursday, are likely to shape expectations on when the Federal Reserve might cut interest rates again. Strong recent economic data have led markets to push back expectations for easing until at least June.Corporate earnings remain in focus, with results due this week from companies including Netflix, Johnson & Johnson, General Electric and Intel, alongside major banks.In currency markets, the euro rose 0.1% to $1.1613 after an early dip, while sterling edged up to $1.3387. The dollar fell 0.2% against the Swiss franc and 0.3% against the yen.US Treasury cash markets were closed, but 10-year futures edged higher as investors looked for safety. Gold climbed 1.5% to $4,664 an ounce.Oil prices slipped, with Brent crude down 0.5% at $63.84 a barrel and US crude off 0.4% at $59.18.

'NATO Unbeatable, Tariffs A Mistake': Meloni BREAKS Ranks With Trump On Greenland | WATCH

European Union leaders will hold an emergency meeting in Brussels on Thursday to decide how to respond to US President Donald Trump’s threat to impose new tariffs on several European countries.EU ambassadors met on Sunday and broadly agreed on a bilateral approach. This includes intensifying diplomatic efforts to discourage Washington from proceeding with the tariffs, while preparing retaliatory measures if the duties are imposed, EU diplomats said, according to Reuters.Trump on Saturday said that he would introduce a new wave of tariffs from February 1 on Denmark, Sweden, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Finland, Britain and Norway. He called the move necessary until the United States is allowed to buy Greenland.European leaders sharply criticized the move, describing the threat as coercive and unacceptable.At Thursday’s emergency summit, EU leaders are expected to discuss two main options. The first is a previously approved package of retaliatory tariffs on €93 billion ($108 billion) worth of US imports.These measures were suspended for six months after the EU and the US reached a limited trade agreement last year; however, could automatically come into force from February 6 if no solution is found.The second option is the EU’s “Anti-Coercion Instrument” (ACI), a powerful but so far unused tool that would allow the bloc to restrict access to public procurement, investment, banking activity or trade in services.The United States runs a surplus with the EU in services, including digital services, making this a potentially significant step. EU sources said support for immediate use of the ACI remains mixed, with broader backing for tariffs as a first response.European Council President Antonio Costa, in a social media post, said that the consultations with member states showed strong unity in support of Denmark and Greenland and a shared readiness to defend against “any form of coercion,” according to Bloomberg.Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen echoed that stance, saying Europe would not be blackmailed, while also welcoming the solidarity shown by other EU capitals.Denmark, however, has stressed the need to keep diplomatic channels open. Danish Foreign Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen said Copenhagen would continue to focus on dialogue, pointing to a working group set up last week involving Denmark, Greenland and the United States.“The US is also more than the U.S. president. I've just been there. There are also checks and balances in American society,” he said.Diplomacy is also expected to feature prominently at the World Economic Forum in Davos, where Trump is due to deliver a keynote address on Wednesday, his first appearance at the event in six years.“All options are on the table,” one EU diplomat said, summarising the bloc’s approach as talks in Davos followed by leaders meeting in Brussels.The eight countries targeted by the tariff threat are already subject to US duties of 10% to 15%. They issued a joint statement on Sunday warning that tariff threats undermine transatlantic relations and risk a “dangerous downward spiral”. The statement said they were ready to engage in dialogue, based on respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity.Views within the EU remain divided on how hard a line to take. A source close to French President Emmanuel Macron said he favours activating the ACI.Irish Prime Minister Micheál Martin said retaliation was inevitable if tariffs were imposed but cautioned it was “a bit premature” to deploy the new instrument.Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni called the tariff threat a mistake and said she had raised her concerns directly with him.In Britain, Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy said allies should work with the United States to resolve the dispute and avoid escalating rhetoric, stressing that London’s position on Greenland was non-negotiable.The tariff threat has also cast doubt on recent trade arrangements. The European Parliament is expected to suspend work on approving the EU-US trade deal, which was due to be voted on later this month. Lawmakers from major political groups said approval was not possible under the current circumstances.Markets reacted nervously to the developments, with the euro and sterling falling against the dollar and analysts warning of renewed volatility if the standoff deepens.","EU leaders will hold an emergency meeting in Brussels on Thursday to decide how to respond to US President Donald Trump’s threat to impose new tariffs on several European countries.

The three kinds of US undergrad returnees



1) Ultra-wealthy family business backgrounds

2) Wealthy professional-class families

3) Financial aid and merit-based entrants

What BARBIEs tend to build in India



quick commerce and logistics

ecommerce and consumer brands

fintech and payments

software tools and B2B products built out of India

gaming, entertainment, and social platforms

education and upskilling



Zepto : The clearest recent example of the BARBIE pipeline

Founders and leaders with global exposure shaping India’s startup scene

Some widely cited examples include:

Aadit Palicha and Kaivalya Vohra (Zepto), linked to US university exposure before building one of India’s most prominent quick-commerce startups

Peyush Bansal (Lenskart), who has studied abroad and worked internationally before scaling Lenskart into a major consumer eyewear business

Deepinder Goyal (Zomato), who went from a corporate career into building a consumer internet company that became a major publicly listed platform

Kunal Shah (CRED), who has built consumer-fintech businesses and remained closely connected to global startup thinking and networks

Why India is increasingly the preferred place to build



Where BARBIEs commonly come from

A new label is doing the rounds in India’s startup circles: BARBIEs, short for Bachelors Abroad Returning to Build in the Indian Ecosystem. A viral post shared by Anshul and Anmol on X put the spotlight on this niche but growing group of Indians who study abroad for their undergraduate degree and then come back to India to build high-growth companies. The idea travelled further after it was reposted by entrepreneur and investor Deedy Das.US undergraduate education is also an expensive path. For many families, it can run into hundreds of thousands of dollars over four years, which makes the cohort relatively small compared with the far larger number of Indians who go abroad for Master’s programmes. Even so, BARBIE-style returnees have become increasingly visible in India’s startup world because many of them show up early as builders: launching companies, joining fast-scaling startups, and moving quickly into product and leadership roles.Although US undergrad Indians are often seen as one elite group, their trajectories generally fall into a few patterns, shaped by family background and career incentives.These students often study economics, finance, or fields linked to their family industries. Many return to India quickly, either to join the family business or to start a venture with family backing.This segment includes students from families working in tech, law, finance, or medicine. Many study computer science or engineering, take up jobs in the US after graduation, and some later return to build companies, often in tech-driven sectors.A smaller group reaches top universities through scholarships or financial aid. They are commonly STEM-focused, and many stay in the US longer for work or higher studies. When they do build companies, they often bring strong technical depth and a long-term approach.Most BARBIE-style returnees building in India lean into sectors where India offers massive scale and fast adoption. Their businesses often sit in categories like:The common thread is not just “starting up” but building for India’s size: speed, distribution, hiring at scale, and an obsession with execution.If there is one startup that captures the BARBIE conversation today, it is Zepto.The company’s founders, Aadit Palicha and Kaivalya Vohra, are widely associated with the “US university to India startup” route. Their story has become a reference point for how quickly a new generation can move from global classrooms to India’s high-pressure consumer market, especially in sectors like quick commerce where speed and operations matter as much as product.While BARBIEs specifically points to undergraduate education abroad, India’s broader startup ecosystem also includes founders and leaders shaped by international exposure in different ways, including overseas education, global work experience, and connections to global tech networks.These names are not all “US undergrad returnees”, but they show how global exposure, in different forms, has become a recurring ingredient in India’s modern startup leadership.A major shift over the last decade is that many globally educated Indians no longer view returning to India as a second choice.For some, the US path can feel uncertain due to immigration friction and a highly competitive job market. For others, the pull is simply stronger in India: the ability to build for a massive consumer base, scale quickly, and solve problems that feel more relevant to everyday life.Entrepreneurship has also become more mainstream. Startup culture is now part of popular media and daily conversation, and young founders see building companies as a legitimate first-career move rather than a risky detour.The “Google to Zepto” contrast captures a real choice facing many globally trained Indians.In the US, graduates often gravitate towards stable high-paying roles or tech-first startups, especially in enterprise software and deep-tech. In India, the momentum often sits with consumer-facing companies where distribution, logistics, and speed define success.That is why names like Zepto have become shorthand for the new returnee founder mood: faster, younger, more operational, and focused on building in India rather than waiting for the “perfect time” abroad.This group often emerges from a narrow education pipeline: elite English-medium schools in major metros, and prominent boarding or international schools. Many grow up fluent in English, comfortable in Western academic environments, and able to adapt quickly to US university life.That background often makes it easier to build networks early and navigate global systems. It also means this cohort is small and concentrated.Privilege plays a role, and the cost barrier around overseas undergraduate education makes that unavoidable. But what often stands out about BARBIE-style returnees is the mix of early independence, global exposure, and strong peer networks they bring back with them.In India’s current startup cycle, that combination can translate into speed: faster hiring, clearer product thinking, sharper fundraising instincts, and the confidence to build big early.","A new label is doing the rounds in India’s startup circles: BARBIEs, short for Bachelors Abroad Returning to Build in the Indian Ecosystem. These students often study economics, finance, or fields linked to their family industries. Many return to India quickly, either to join the family business or to start a venture with family backing.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126647397,imgsize-48326,width-400,resizemode-4/the-barbies-from-google-to-zepto-what-us-undergrad-returnees-are-building-in-india.jpg"

NEW DELHI: More than 1.14 lakh startups in India have created over 12 lakh jobs so far, the finance ministry said in its latest review of the Indian economy.In the report titled, ‘The Indian Economy: A Review January 2024’, the Department of Economic Affairs said that the 1.14 lakh startups recognised by the government under the 'Startup India initiative’ created more than 12 lakh jobs (as of October 2023).The state-owned e-commerce platform Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) clocked more than 63 lakh transactions till November 2023, the document read.Despite facing global challenges in 2023 like valuation issues, few IPOs, regulatory changes and macroeconomic and geopolitical trends, India remains the third largest tech start-up ecosystem globally, with over 950 tech startups founded last year.The cumulative funding for more than 31,000 tech start ups has exceeded $70 billion (from 2019 to 2023), according to a recent report by Nasscom in collaboration with Zinnov.“In 2023, despite facing global economic and regulatory challenges, Indian tech startups have prioritised the imperative of enhancing their business fundamentals, driving profitability and growth,” said Debjani Ghosh, President, Nasscom.“The proliferation of tech startups in tier 2 and 3 cities marks the ecosystem's resilience,” she added.Navigating 2024, tech startup founders expect to continue the revenue growth path with measured steps focusing on optimising expenditure and maximising profitability for B2B tech startups.Investments in deeptech will continue an upward trend in 2024. With generative AI (GenAI) acceleration, 70 per cent of start-up founders are embedding artificial intelligence (AI) in their solutions.As funding becomes scarce for the Indian startup ecosystem in general, the explosion of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has given a new lease of life to entrepreneurs and founders in the country, as the Centre extends support to the sector.","The state-owned e-commerce platform Open Network for Digital Commerce clocked more than 63 lakh transactions till November 2023.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021.

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart.

Space sector start-up Sisir Radar to develop SAR on L/P band SAR,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/space-sector-start-up-sisir-radar-to-develop-sar-on-l/p-band-sar/articleshow/104558111.cms,"CHENNAI: Space sector startup, Sisir Radar Private Ltd has hit success at the prestigious iDEX DefSpace Challenge with its projects for development of “L/P band Continuous Wave SAR (synthetic aperture radar) payload for LEO Small Satellites” and “Unfurlable, Electronically Steering Antenna for L/P band SAR payload” for Indian Air Force (IAF), said a top company official.The company is promoted by former Director at the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) Tapan Misra and the brains behind the Indian space agency’s RISAT series of SAR satellites as well as the Dual Frequency SAR on the Chandrayaan 2 orbiter that is currently circling the moon.""A grant of Rs 3 crore is also there for development of the products,"" Misra told IANS.Synthetic Aperture Radar or SAR is a special kind of imaging radar technology that can provide extremely accurate high resolution imagery of the terrain through clouds, smoke and dust even in pitch dark conditions. SAR imagery provides much higher resolution than other forms of remote sensing technology such as hyperspectral and multispectral. SAR is a critical technology for strategic reconnaissance and planning as well as for disaster management.According to Misra, winning the challenge in just over a year of floating the company is a major booster.He said L and P band SAR have an advantage over other frequencies (like X band) when it comes to penetration capabilities through rain, clouds, foliage and vegetation in a tropical country like India, and underground penetration capabilities in dry terrain.Continuing further, he said the L band SAR will provide 1 metre resolution, spotlight resolution in Stripmap mode. The current industry standard is 5-10 metre in L band. Misra said both the L and P band will operate simultaneously from a satellite borne SAR. Recently, Sisir Radar successfully developed and tested the world’s highest resolution L-Band SAR fitted on a drone. With 0.2 metre resolution, this is by far the highest L band SAR in the world, he said.","Space sector startup, Sisir Radar Private Ltd has hit success at the prestigious iDEX DefSpace Challenge.

Explainer: What is 'Hindu rate of growth' and why Raghuram Rajan's remarks may be 'premature',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/explainer-what-is-hindu-rate-of-growth-and-why-raghuram-rajans-remarks-may-be-premature/articleshow/98482598.cms,"What is meant by Hindu growth rate

How India's GDP has been growing

What SBI report said on savings and investment

Incremental capital output ratio

NEW DELHI: India's gross domestic product (GDP) data for the third quarter (October-December 2022) received a word of caution from the former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan In an interview with news agency PTI, Rajan that India is ""dangerously close"" to the Hindu rate of growth in view of subdued private sector investment, high interest rates and slowing global growth.India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying"".However, a report released by the State Bank of India (SBI) economists on Tuesday dismissed arguments that India is dangerously close to Hindu rate of growth saying such statements are ""ill-conceived, biased and premature"".The term 'Hindu growth rate' was coined by late economist Raj Krishna in 1978 to describe the slow growth in the country.It basically refers to the low pace of economic growth rates during 1950s to 1980s. During this period, the Indian economy averaged 3.5%.A former lecturer at the Delhi School of Economics (DSE), Krishna noted that only if the rate of growth is persistently slow and accompanied by low per-capita GDP, then it will be known as Hindu rate of growth but it has to factor in population growth as well.Before economic reforms of 1991, India's economic growth remained stagnant and low, while per capita income averaged around 1.3%.Krishna termed this low growth situation to be a result of socialist policies of state control and import substitution.However, the economic situation changed when liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation (LPG) reforms came into effect in the year 1991, at a time when India faced balance of payment crisis.Over the years, many economists have strongly opposed the idea of 'Hindu growth rate' and the term never had universal acceptance.The Indian economy plunged into its very first technical recession in FY21 due to the impact of Covid-19 pandemic and the related nationwide lockdowns. GDP shrunk by an unprecedented 23.8% in the first quarter of the financial year 2020-21. However, due to spurt in economic activities in the subsequent quarters, the GDP decline started to narrow.However, if we look at the period before Covid-19 as well, India's growth curve shows a declining trend.From 8.26% in FY17, GDP growth plunged to 3.74% in FY20. Shutdown of economic activities in FY21 in wake of Covid-19 only made matters worse.As lockdowns started to ease and business activities resumed, India's GDP also started rising. In Q1 of FY22, growth jumped to 20.1% mainly on account of low base effect. By the fourth quarter of FY22, growth came down to 4.10%.Similarly, the new financial year 2022-23 brought fresh economic challenges in the form of Russia-Ukraine war that impacted almost all major economies of the world, slowed the pace of growth, pushed inflation to record highs.As a result, the central banks of all advanced economies spurred into action and opted for monetary policy tightening to curb the soaring inflation.With persistently rising interest rates, India's economy grew by 4.4% in Q3 of FY23, as the Centre revised upwards GDP growth for previous year to 9.10% from 8.7% earlier.The report weighed recent GDP numbers against the available data on savings and investments for the past decade and highlighted some interesting points.""Quarterly growth numbers are noisy and should be best avoided for any serious interpretation (on an average, India's GDP growth has witnessed Rs 2 lakh crore upward revision for the 3 year ended FY23),"" the report said.Gross capital formation (GCF) by the government touched a high of 11.8% in 2021-22, up from 10.7% in 2020-21.""This also had a domino effect on private sector investment that jumped from 10 per cent to 10.8% over the same period,"" it said.In fact, Ecowrap added that the trends in GCF to gross output ratio or the plough back of funds for creation of fresh capacity shows that for public administration the ratio attained fresh peak in 2021-22 owing to the emphasis on capital expenditure in recent budgets.At the aggregate level, gross capital formation is supposed to have crossed 32% in 2022-23, the highest level since 2018-19.According to the report, in 2021-22, gross savings have risen to 30% from 29% in 2020-21.""The ratio is supposed to have crossed 31 per cent in 2022-23, the highest since 2018-19. The household savings increased sharply during the pandemic period on account of sharp accretion in financial savings such as deposits,"" said the report by SBI's Economic Research Department.While household financial savings have since then moderated from 15.4% in 2020-21 to 11.1% in 2022-23, savings in physical assets have grown sharply to 11.8% in 2021-22 from 10.7% in 2020-21.The report further analysed Incremental Capital Output ratio (ICOR) -- which measures additional units of capital (investment) needed to produce additional units of output. It said that the ratio has been improving.""ICOR which was 7.5 in FY 12 is now only 3.5 in FY22. Clearly, only half of capital is now needed for next unit of output,"" the report noted.Such reducing ICOR in the current years reflects a relatively increasing efficiency of capital and shows that the economy is on a sound footing, the report said.""From that point of view, future GDP growth rates even at 7% could still mean a decent number by any standards!,"" it added.","India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%. Raghuram Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying""","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-98483158,imgsize-65724,width-400,resizemode-4/98483158.jpg"

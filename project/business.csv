Stock market recommendations:Benchmark indices remained range-bound last week, following a robust bullish rally in the preceding sessions. Global investors stayed on the sidelines, tracking developments on US–China and US–India trade negotiations. The US Federal Reserve, in its latest FOMC policy meeting, delivered a second consecutive rate cut, bringing the federal funds rate down to 3.75–4.00%, marking the lowest level in three years. However, Chair Jerome Powell’s neutral stance on the future monetary policy trajectory prompted profit-taking at higher levels on Thursday, leading to mild consolidation across key indices.Over the past six trading sessions, the Nifty has exhibited a sideways consolidation pattern, moving within a well-defined range of 25,700–26,100, broadly in line with expectations following the recent rally. This phase of time-wise correction suggests that the market is currently in a pause mode, digesting prior gains before the next directional move.From a technical perspective, sustained trade above the upper band of 26,100 could act as a trigger for bullish momentum, potentially propelling the index towards its previous all-time high of 26,277. A decisive breakout beyond this level may open the door for a further upside towards 26,500 in the near term, supported by improving market breadth and positive sectoral rotationThe broader market trajectory continues to exhibit a bullish bias, reaffirming that the primary uptrend remains firmly in place.The ongoing phase of consolidation is best interpreted as a healthy retracement and time correction following a sharp 1,500-point up move over the past four weeks.This constructive consolidation provides market participants with an opportune window to initiate fresh long positions and accumulate high-quality, fundamentally sound counters through a staggered accumulation strategy, thereby optimizing entry levels. In essence, the market appears to be undergoing a technical breather within an ongoing bullish structure, setting the stage for the next leg of the upward momentum once the consolidation base is firmly established.Strong support is seen around 25,700–25,500, which is likely to hold as it is the confluence of the recent breakout zone. The 20 days EMA is also placed around 25580 and the 38.2% retracement of the previous up move (24587-26104)Bank Nifty continues to maintain a bullish structure on the daily and weekly chart, forming a series of higher highs and higher lows in all time frames.Going ahead, a decisive move above last week’s high of 58,577 would confirm a breakout continuation, paving the way for a rally towards 59,000 and 59,300, which correspond to the 138.2% Fibonacci projection of the recent correction (57,628–53,561). However, failure to clear this level may result in range-bound movement between 58,600 and 57,300 in the near term.On the downside, immediate support is seen around 57,300–57,500, aligning with the previous breakout zone, while a stronger support base lies near 56,800–56,500.Overall, the outlook remains positive, and any pullbacks should be viewed as buying opportunities within these support areas.The stock has broken out above the falling trendline connecting the June 2025 and September 2025 highs, signaling strength and offering a fresh entry opportunity. The price action is forming a higher high–higher low structure on the daily timeframe, reinforcing the bullish outlook.We anticipate the stock to move higher towards the 129 level, which aligns with the June 2025 high and the 123.6% Fibonacci extension of the prior upswing from 98 to 117, projected from the recent low at 105.From a technical indicator perspective, the RSI remains in a bullish configuration and has recently triggered a buy signal, suggesting continued upward momentum.The stock is displaying a sustained bullish structure, forming consecutive higher highs and higher lows on the weekly chart. It has also broken out of a prolonged base formation, accompanied by a decisive breach of its falling trendline resistance — signaling a transition from a consolidation phase to a fresh uptrend.A clear breakout from the descending triangle pattern has already occurred thus opening upwards towards 62 in the medium term being measured move projection derived from the descending triangle breakout.On the indicator front, the weekly RSI is exhibiting a steady upward trajectory, reflecting sustained strength in momentum. There are no visible signs of exhaustion or bearish divergence, suggesting that the prevailing bullish momentum remains intact without indications of a trend reversal.","According to Bajaj Broking Research, the top stock picks for October 31, 2025 are NBCC, and Sagility.

Eyewear retailer Lenskart Solutions has opened its initial public offering (IPO) on Friday, aiming to raise Rs 2,150 crore through a fresh issue of shares, while promoters and existing investors will sell 12.75 crore shares via an offer for sale (OFS).The IPO will remain open till November 4 and the company is set to hit Dalal Street on November 10. Shares will be alloted to investors on November 6.Lenskart plans to utilise proceeds from the fresh issue towards setting up new company-operated, company-owned (CoCo) stores, expenditure on lease and rental agreements for these outlets, and investments in technology, cloud infrastructure, and brand marketing. The company has also earmarked funds for potential inorganic acquisitions and general corporate purposes.It has a price band of Rs 382–Rs 402 per share, and is seeking a valuation of over Rs 69,700 crore on the upper end.The entity’s grey market premium stood at Rs 70 per share, according to ET. This indicates that the company’s shares might list around Rs 472, a premium of 17.41%.SBI Securities has advised investors to “Subscribe for long term”, pointing to Lenskart’s strong business model and its leadership in a market that has major space to grow.The brokerage said listing gains may be limited, but the company’s integrated supply chain, better profitability metrics, and strong brand strength support its long-term growth.Ventura Securities has also given a “Subscribe” recommendation, describing Lenskart as a growth-led business. It cited the company’s technology-focused strategy, AI-driven customer engagement, and a store payback period of under one year, adding that profitability is expected to strengthen as the business expands into additional regions.Nirmal Bang, according to ET, acknowledged that the IPO appears expensive at first, but the valuation holds up when compared with modern retail peers such as Trent and Metro. The brokerage maintained a Subscribe (long-term) stance, referring to Lenskart’s brand strength, premium product mix, and international expansion plans.The company’s market debut follows a strong response in the anchor book. On Thursday, Lenskart garnered bids worth around Rs 68,000 crore from anchor investors, people familiar with the matter told PTI. The bid amount was nearly 10 times the total issue size of Rs 7,278 crore and close to 20 times the Rs 3,268-crore anchor allocation. Ahead of the IPO, SBI Mutual Fund invested Rs 100 crore, while Avenue Supermarts (DMart) founder Radhakishan Damani invested around Rs 90 crore.Founded in 2008, Lenskart began as an online platform in 2010 and opened its first physical store in 2013 in New Delhi. It now operates an omni-channel model, offering prescription eyewear, sunglasses, and contact lenses across metro, tier-1, and tier-2 cities, and has expanded internationally to Southeast Asia and the Middle East.The company designs, manufactures, brands, and retails eyewear through facilities in Bhiwadi and Gurugram, supported by regional hubs in Singapore and the UAE. Lenskart added 847 stores since FY23, taking its network to 2,806 outlets as of June 2025, 2,137 in India and 669 overseas.According to ET, the company’s revenue surged over 32% annually to Rs 6,652.5 crore, while EBITDA rose 93.4% to Rs 971.1 crore, with margins improving to 14.6% in FY25 from 6.9% in FY23. Lenskart posted a net profit of Rs 297.3 crore in FY25, compared to a net loss of Rs 63.8 crore in FY23, though the profit was aided by one-off gains.Lenskart holds an estimated 4–6% market share in India’s eyewear market, but faces competition in a sector that remains 77% unorganised, according to Redseer, placing the company at a combination of a large opportunity and a highly fragmented market. According to Redseer, Lenskart was the largest seller of prescription eyeglasses in India by volume in FY25.","Lenskart Solutions has opened its initial public offering (IPO) on Friday.

Pak Minister Khawaja Asif Accuses Afghanistan Acting Under India’s Influence, Issues Brutal Warning

Importance of Chabahar port for India





In a boost for India’s regional connectivity plans especially with regard to Afghanistan, the Donald Trump administration has granted extension of sanctions waiver on Iran’s Chabahar port According to an ET report, India has managed to get an extension for the sanctions waiver until early next year on the Chabahar Port. This port plays a vital role in India’s regional connectivity strategy by providing access to Afghanistan and Central Asia-Eastern Russia.Following the expiry of the US sanctions waiver on Tuesday, India successfully negotiated an extension until early next year, sources told ET. During extensive discussions, India emphasised the necessity of maintaining the Chabahar Port's operations as an essential component of its regional connectivity initiatives.Earlier reports had confirmed that New Delhi was working towards obtaining an extension of the sanctions waiver, with the matter under review. India had received a US sanctions waiver for the port until October 28, following an initial deadline of September 29 for the waiver's revocation.On May 13, 2024, India entered into a decade-long agreement to operate the Chabahar port. The contract was finalised between Indian Ports Global Limited and Iran's Port & Maritime Organisation.The Chabahar Port plays a vital role in strengthening India-Afghanistan economic relations and delivering humanitarian assistance, including ambulances that India provided during the Afghan foreign minister's recent visit.The Taliban administration shows strong interest in utilising the Chabahar Port for international connections.Plans are underway to link Chabahar Port with the International North-South Transport Corridor and Central Asian nations. Sources told the financial daily that India's Central Asian ally Uzbekistan, following a multipolar approach, seeks alternatives to China's Belt and Road Initiative for connectivity in Eurasia and anticipates India's involvement in addressing Chabahar Port matters.Notably, Uzbekistan holds the distinction of being one of only two doubly landlocked countries globally, alongside Liechtenstein.Reports suggest that Russia intends to access the Chabahar Port through Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan to facilitate trade with India and other Asian regions.","On May 13, 2024, India entered into a decade-long agreement to operate the Chabahar port.

8th Pay Commission: Top things to know about Cabinet decision





In a big cheer for central government employees, PM Narendra Modi-led Union Cabinet on Tuesday approved the Terms of Reference for the 8th Central Pay Commission.The 8th Central Pay Commission’s proposals will raise the salaries of approximately 50 lakh central government staff members and pensions of 69 lakh retired personnel.In January 2025, the Government announced the formation of the 8th Central Pay Commission to review and propose revisions to the salaries and benefits of Central Government employees.Also Read | 8th Pay Commission: How much salary & pension hike should central government employees, pensioners expect? Top things to know According to the Cabinet release, the 8th Central Pay Commission Commission will function as a temporary entity, consisting of a Chairperson, one Part-Time Member, and one Member-Secretary. Its recommendations are due within 18 months of its establishment, with the possibility of submitting interim reports when specific recommendations are finalised.The 8th Pay Commission, led by former Supreme Court justice Ranjana Prakash Desai, will deliver a preliminary report to the government.Professor Pulak Ghosh from IIM Bangalore has been appointed as a part-time commissioner, whilst Petroleum Secretary Pankaj Jain will serve as the Member Secretary.When questioned about the implementation timing of the 8th Pay Commission's recommendations, I&B Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said, ""The specific date will be decided once the interim report comes in... But, mostly it should be January 1, 2026.""The 8th Central Pay Commission's deliberations will consider:i. The economic conditions in the country and the need for fiscal prudence;ii. The need to ensure that adequate resources are available for developmental expenditure and welfare measures;iii. The unfunded cost of non-contributory pension schemes;iv. The likely impact of the recommendations on the finances of the State Governments which usually adopt the recommendations with some modifications; andv. The prevailing emolument structure, benefits and working conditions available to employees of Central Public Sector Undertakings and private sector.Terms of Reference (TOR) serves as a framework document for a pay commission, establishing guidelines and parameters for preparing its report. It includes essential definitions, terms and conditions that guide the commission's work.The Terms of Reference is drafted by a Joint Consultative Machinery (JCM), with final approval from the Cabinet Committee under the Finance Ministry. The JCM includes union representatives from various ministries. From its 60 members, 12 are chosen for the standing committee. These selected members engage in discussions about TOR subjects with secretary-level government officials. The finalised TOR is then submitted for Cabinet approval.The significance of TOR lies in its function as a main reference document when a pay commission develops its recommendations.According to a TOI report, the government has kept the terms of reference undisclosed, yet the committee's primary responsibility involves examining the financial implications of non-contributory pension programmes.The central government's decision to transition from the National Pension System to Unified Pension Scheme for pre-2004 recruits lacks clarity on pension payment obligations.This absence of estimated liabilities has resulted in no budgetary allocations. Additionally, any increase in employee remuneration and benefits will inevitably lead to enhanced pension commitments.Central Pay Commissions are established periodically to evaluate and recommend changes to emoluments, retirement benefits and service conditions for Central Government employees.These recommendations are typically implemented on a ten-year cycle. Following this pattern, the 8th Central Pay Commission's recommendations would take effect from January 1, 2026.The 7th Pay Commission was established in February 2014, with its proposals taking effect from January 1, 2016.Central government staff receive dearness allowance (DA) to offset inflation's impact on their actual salary value. This DA rate undergoes regular revision every six months, with adjustments linked to inflation levels.","The 8th Central Pay Commission’s proposals will raise the salaries of approximately 50 lakh central government staff members and pensions of 69 lakh retired personnel.

TVS Motor Company benefits from a strong product/momentum backdrop, with solid volumes and a healthy launch pipeline that bolster confidence in sustained performance.

Structural tailwinds, including recent GST rate cuts, a buoyant festive season and a favourable product cycle, further support the outlook. Analysts have upgraded forecasts, citing higher earnings visibility and long-term growth prospects. With large projected CAGRs in revenue, EBITDA and PAT, the company’s premium valuation is supported by valuation discipline and the expectation of sustained outperformance.M&M Financials posted a strong 2Q FY26 result, with profit rising sharply yoy and beating expectations. Other income saw a robust upswing, driven by higher fee income and dividend income from its insurance-broking arm.Net interest margin expanded by around 12 basis-points qoq, reflecting lower funding costs and reduced leverage post-rights-issue, and management expects margins to hold steady.Business momentum improved late in the quarter and into October, with pickup in tractor and passenger-vehicle volumes aided by GST cuts. The used-vehicle segment gained share, underscoring diversification of channels. Asset quality improved compared to historical trends, and management expects further improvement in the second half.The company targets 15% growth in its loan book for FY26, supported by 18-20% disbursement growth in H2. Credit cost guidance has improved to 1.7% of assets in FY26 and 1.6% in FY27.

Jefferies has a buy on Adani Power with the price target at Rs 195. Analysts said the company’s Sept quarter earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) was 4% lower than expectation due to lower utilisation on weak power demand. They also feel the recent thermal tariff power purchase agreements (PPAs) are being signed at close to Rs 6/unit against sub-Rs 5.5/unit earlier, which should lead to better profitability for FY28-FY30.Nomura has a buy on ITC with the target price at Rs 540. Analysts said the company’s July-Sept quarter (Q2FY26) was in-line with expectations. They expect the paperboard business to recover soon, while its agri business declined on high base and the foodtech business is scaling up.Citigroup has maintained its buy rating on Hyundai Motor India with the target price raised to Rs 2,900 from Rs 2,850 earlier. Analysts said results were broadly in line with net profit about 1% above estimate. The company saw strong festive demand, combined with the effect of cut in GST rates. The company also saw its compact SUVs outperform the market while rural market demand remains in focus. Analysts also expect exports growth to exceed its 7-8% growth guidance.Morgan Stanley maintained its underweight rating on Cipla with the target price at Rs 1,396. Analysts said its Q2FY26 was in-line with expectations while the company lowered its margin guidance. They said muted FY25-FY28 earnings per share (EPS) compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of just 1% keeps them underweight. They also said that the company could face a slowdown in earnings in the near-term and there is limited visibility growth for the next few months.CLSA has an outperform rating on Swiggy with the target price at Rs 493. Analysts said Q2FY26 was a mixed bag with marked improvement in contribution per order for Instamart but at the cost of a deceleration in order growth and customer additions. They said food delivery was also a mixed bag with better take rates but a slightly lower-than-expected contribution and EBIDTA. While Swiggy has made positive strides, gap in execution compared with Eternal widened this quarter, analysts said.",Jefferies has a buy on Adani Power with the price target at Rs 195.

From AI Ambitions to IPO Milestones: India's startup spirit soars,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/from-ai-ambitions-to-ipo-milestones-indias-startup-spirit-soars/articleshow/125044901.cms,"



BENGALURU: Satyan Gajwani, chairman of Times Internet, said that as the world accelerates into an AIdriven future, the bar for innovation, governance, and vision continues to rise. “If there’s one thing this ecosystem has shown again, it’s that India learns fast, adapts faster, and thrives under challenge,” he said, delivering the keynote address at the ET Startup Awards 2025 held in Bengaluru on Friday.The evening brought together some of India’s most innovative entrepreneurs and changemakers. Gajwani said the success of emerging technology companies demonstrates how India is no longer just a market for global technology but a creator of it.“To truly lead this next wave, we must build AI innovation hubs where talent, compute power, and capital converge to solve long-term problems. We’ll need deep research, patient capital, and visionary policymaking because we cannot afford to be left behind,” he said.Union commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal, who was the chief guest and who handed over the awards, said India has the depth and savings to create its own pool of capital for deep tech startups, and called for greater use of domestic funds to accelerate the next phase of growth in the country’s startup ecosystem.“We should not be overly dependent on foreign venture capital,” he said.Gajwani said the energy, ambition, and risk-taking that defined the last decade must now find fresh momentum. “Startups have become part of India’s investing fabric. Since 2021, Indian startups have raised more than Rs 1 lakh crore, or about $12 billion, through 33 IPOs in the country’s public markets. Teachers, engineers, small business owners — ordinary Indians — are placing their faith in you, trusting you with their hard-earned savings. That’s a tremendous privilege and a huge responsibility,” he said.Peyush Bansal, cofounder & CEO of last year’s startup of the year winner, Lenskart, which is in the midst of an IPO, said during a fireside chat that an IPO is an important milestone in a company’s journey. But, he said, it still feels like day one, and the dream is to give vision to a billion people. “Now (with IPO) it feels like it’s not just our dream — it is India’s dream to create a global eyewear company for the world,” he said. Responding to the controversy about its IPO being initially overvalued, Bansal said criticism isn’t necessarily a bad thing. “Shark Tank has somewhat trained me for the public world,” he said.Abhiraj Singh Bhal, cofounder & CEO of this year’s startup of the year, Urban Company, said in a panel discussion that they had always thought of Urban Company as a 50-year institution, not a 5-year one. “So, everything we do — the way we build, the way we grow, the way we think of profitability — is with that long horizon in mind,” he said.Urban Company, founded in 2014 and which had a hugely successful IPO last month, connects millions of consumers with trained and verified service professionals across categories such as beauty, home repairs, cleaning, and appliance maintenance. Asked about balancing growth and profitability, he said, “It’s not growth versus profitability — it’s growth with profitability. If you are not efficient, growth becomes expensive; if you are not growing, profitability becomes meaningless. ”In the same panel was Myntra CEO Nandita Sinha and Rapido cofounder Aravind Sanka. Sinha said fashion is a $120 billion market with vast potential for further growth. “And coupled with that, you have 400 million Gen Z consumers who are truly defining what fashion means — they’re disrupting for us, for sure. When we build for the Gen Z consumer, we know they are digitally native, they really want content-first shopping experiences. They are trend-first consumers — they may or may not be brand-first consumers,” she said.Sanka said urban mobility will be multimodal, with the future focused on integrating these experiences seamlessly. Asked about regulations and policy, which have been hurting the mobility aggregator in some states, he said, “We’ve seen positive moves from several state govts that understand the importance of bike taxis and shared mobility. It’s about creating frameworks that encourage innovation while ensuring safety. ”","Satyan Gajwani, chairman of Times Internet, said that as the world accelerates into an AIdriven future, the bar for innovation, governance, and vision continues to rise.

"After 3 months, foreign portfolio investors turn net buyers",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/after-3-months-foreign-portfolio-investors-turn-net-buyers/articleshow/125044855.cms,"



MUMBAI: In October, foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) turned net buyers of stocks in the Indian market again, and infused a little over Rs 14,600 crore. Between July and Sept this year, FPIs had net sold stocks worth a little over Rs 76,600 crore, data from NSDL showed.The net buying by foreign funds was because of resilient corporate earnings of Indian companies, a series of rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve in the last few months, and hopes of a US-India trade deal that would address the ongoing tariff-related issues, among others. The net purchase of domestic equities came despite the rupee hitting a new all-time low against the dollar, market players said.Official data showed that in Sept, foreign funds had net sold stocks worth Rs 23,885 crore, Rs 34,993 crore in Aug and Rs 17,741 crore in July.Oct's Rs 14,610-crore net inflow was the second highest monthly net buying figure for 2025, behind a Rs 19,860-crore inflow in May and just ahead of June figure of Rs 14,590 crore.According to Shrikant Chouhan, head equity research, Kotak Securities, globally investors were again taking a positive view of equities in Oct because of a new trade truce between China and the US, the US Fed cutting interest rates, and Alphabet, Meta, and Microsoft raising their capex guidance.However, going forward, the flows could be volatile, Chouhan said.VK Vijayakumar, chief investment strategist, Geojit Investments, was also cautious about the sustainability of FPI flows through stocks. ""The relatively higher valuations in India may prompt FPIs to sell again. Whether FPIs will buy or sell will depend on the trajectory of India's corporate sector's earnings growth,"" Vijayakumar said. ""There are clear signs of earnings recovery now. If the brisk demand conditions in the market sustains, earnings will improve, which, in turn, will make valuations fair.

"IPO deluge: Four new-age cos set to raise over 20,000 crore in November",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/ipo-deluge-four-new-age-cos-set-to-raise-over-20000-crore-in-november/articleshow/125044816.cms,"



MUMBAI: It's a busy Nov for startups on Dalal Street. Lenskart, Groww, Pine Labs and PhysicsWallah, all of which are headed for listing on the bourses this month, are collectively raising over Rs 20,000 crore through IPOs, making it one of the busiest periods of the year.More new-age companies including Meesho, Boat, Shadowfax and Wakefit are in the queue, with a few of them likely to get listed next month. Abhinav Bharti, MD & head of India, emerging capital markets (ECM) at J P Morgan estimates new-age firms to raise anywhere between 30,000-40,000 crore through Nov and Dec. Some bankers expect the number to surpass 40,000 crore. ""We expect India to be the busiest IPO market in the Asia Pacific region in the near-term, led by new age companies,"" Bharti told TOI. Compared to 2024, which saw about 13 new-age listings raising roughly Rs 29,000 crore, this year could close with over 20-25 IPOs from the space, said Kamraj Singh Negi, MD, investment banking at Pantomath Capital Advisors.What's fueling this rush of startups IPOs is the fact that companies are ""seeing value"" in being listed on Indian exchanges amid a growing trend of firms re-domiciling to India and strong domestic fundamentals even in the face of external headwinds, Bharti said.""We are seeing a double-digit pipeline of new-age IPOs, a natural outcome of deep domestic liquidity and growing scale of profitability among tech enabled companies,"" said Kailash Soni, head of India ECM at Goldman Sachs.A market debut allows startups otherwise largely dependent on venture capital to get wider access to capital and gain scale. But most importantly, it also enables them to give exit to investors seeking returns-what has helped startups to go public is a buoyant primary market supported by a broadening pool of domestic investors. Recent data compiled by Bloomberg and Prime Database showed that the share of domestic investments in IPOs has grown from 56.8% in 2021 to 74.8% in 2025.Last year, Swiggy went public through a 140-crore IPO alongside other new-age peers such as Ola Electric and FirstCry. In Sept, Urban Company had a smashing debut on the exchanges, nudging many startups to expedite their IPO filing preparations.Broader markets have been stable, logging their best monthly gains in seven months in Oct. ""We expect nearly 50%-70% more new-age- listings this year versus last, both in number and fundraise,"" said Gaurav Seth, MD & CEO at 5paisa Capital, a unit of IIFL Group."," Lenskart, Groww, Pine Labs and PhysicsWallah are all headed for listing on the bourses this month.

MUMBAI: Large and mid-cap companies have performed better than small-cap companies during the July-Sept quarter of the current fiscal (Q2FY26), an analysis of the quarterly results of some of the leading companies showed. Among 27 of the 50 constituent companies of the Nifty index that have announced their results, the aggregate profit after tax (PAT) had grown 5%; while for a larger group of 151 companies, the corresponding growth rate was 14%, a report by Motilal Oswal Financial Services (MOFSL) said.The overall earnings growth for these 151 companies was led by the ones from sectors like oil & gas, tech, cement, capital goods and metals sectors. ""These five sectors contributed 86% of the incremental YoY accretion in earnings so far,"" the report said. The results of the 151 companies that were analysed, constituted 42% of India's market capitalisation and the 27 Nifty constituents had a combined weight of 69% in the index.Earnings of the 27 Nifty companies that have declared results so far have grown 5% on an annual basis (YoY) against an estimated growth of 6% by the analysts at MOFSL.The earnings growth was driven by HDFC Bank, Reliance Industries, TCS, JSW Steel and Infosys. ""These five companies contributed 122% to the incremental YoY accretion in earnings. (In contrast), Coal India, Axis Bank, Eternal, HUL and Kotak Mahindra Bank dragged Nifty earnings lower,"" the report said.""Seven companies within the Nifty reported lower-than-expected profits, while five recorded a beat, and fifteen registered in-line results.""Within the larger group of 151 companies that MOFSL tracks, large-caps and mid-caps had delivered better than estimated results, while small-caps' results were in line, the report noted. Within this group, 49 large-cap companies posted earnings growth of 13% YoY, similar to the overall universe. 47 mid-cap companies continued their robust showing, a trend seen for the last one year. These companies together delivered an earnings growth at 26% YoY, against an estimated 19% growth.""Multiple mid-cap sectors clocked impressive growth, including technology, cement, metals, PSU banks, real estate, and NBFC - non-lending.

Mehli Mistry files caveat on removal from Tata Trusts; cites past resolution to contest ouster,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/mehli-mistry-files-caveat-on-removal-from-tata-trusts-cites-past-resolution-to-contest-ouster/articleshow/125044333.cms,"



MUMBAI: Mehli Mistry, whose reappointment on Tata Trusts boards was denied by a majority decision last week, filed a caveat before the charity commissioner in Mumbai Saturday requesting an opportunity to be heard before any decision on a change is sanctioned.Mistry, executor of Ratan Tata 's will, has also sent the caveat notice to all trustees of Sir Dorabji Tata Trust, Sir Ratan Tata Trust, and Bai Hirabai Jamsetji Navsari Charitable Institution, including chairman Noel Tata, whose wife Aloo is his first cousin.Rules require the Trusts to file a report with the charity commissioner on the changes within 90 days. Once the charity commissioner accepts the new board composition, only then can the Trusts make changes in the signatories of their bank accounts, official correspondence, etc. Charity commissioner is the first judicial forum where grievances related to public charities are taken up.A caveat is filed to protect the petitioner's interest to ensure that he is notified of the proceedings and has an opportunity to participate in the hearings before any order by the charity commissioner is passed in the particular matter, said senior Supreme Court advocate HP Ranina. In other words, a caveat is a notice not to sanction a change in the board of trustees without Mistry's submissions.Tata Trusts will also present their arguments before the charity commissioner.At Tata Trusts, reappointment of a trustee requires unanimous consent of all trustees. Mistry, who was inducted into the boards of Tata Trusts by Ratan Tata in Oct 2022 for three years, had a tenure which expired on October 28, 2025. On October 23, the Trusts circulated a circular seeking trustees' consent on his reappointment as a permanent trustee. Noel and Trusts' vice chairmen Venu Srinivasan and Vijay Singh denied Mistry's continuation, while three other trustees, Pramit Jhaveri, Darius Khambata and Jehangir Jehangir, favoured his reappointment. Ratan Tata's brother Jimmy Tata abstained from participation. Since there was no unanimity, Mistry's trusteeship was not renewed.Ranina told TOI that Mistry's defence before the charity commissioner will be the unanimous October 17, 2024 resolution passed by the trustees that they all will be reappointed as permanent trustees as and when their existing tenures expire. Ranina said any resolution passed by the Trusts is binding on the public charities according to the Maharashtra Public Trusts Act and the Trusts' deeds. If Trusts want to revoke the October 17 resolution, then they will have to call a meeting and all the trustees will have to unanimously rescind it, Ranina added.However, a trustee who didn't support Mistry's reappointment, had said that the October 17 resolution cannot be interpreted as a procedural formality, which undermines the trustees' fiduciary duties and runs contrary to the law. Senior advocate Devdatt Kamat said Mistry would need to show how due process in conducting the vote rejecting his reappointment was impaired or if there was a mala fide action or if the trust deed was breached since much would also depend on the deed.Senior counsel Shekhar Naphade said the ""jurisdiction of the charity commissioner is very limited and confined only to the genuineness and it is not for the charity commissioner to decide the wisdom or its propriety, but if it leads to a deadlock or issues of any alleged mal-administration, the charity commissioner can step in. Otherwise the Trust is entitled to manage its own affairs in terms of its trust deed.If a trusteeship is not renewed, it constitutes a change in composition of the board of trustees which requires under Sec 22 to be formally and mandatorily reported to the charity commissioner via a change report within 90 days of the change that occurred.""The law also provides for provisional acceptance by the deputy or assistant charity commissioner of the change report within 15 working days of it being filed and for a notice to be issued inviting objections to such change within 30 days from the notice date. The Maharashtra Public Trusts Act provides that if no objections are received the change becomes final, but if objections are made, the deputy charity commissioner “may” hold an inquiry and give a finding in three months.Bombay high court in an Oct 2025 judgment held that in a dispute over management of affairs of a trust, an inquiry would determine the lawful appointment or removal of a trustee and a member removed from the trust could legitimately intervene.","Mehli Mistry, executor of Ratan Tata's will, has also sent the caveat notice to all trustees of Sir Dorabji Tata Trust. Mistry's reappointment on Tata Trusts boards was denied by a majority decision last week. Rules require the Trusts to file a report with the charity commissioner on the changes within 90 days.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125044457,imgsize-732412,width-400,resizemode-4/noel-tata-mehli-mistry.jpg"
Competition law vs patent rights: NCLAT rules CCI has no power to probe patented product disputes; upholds case against Swiss drugmaker Vifor,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/competition-law-vs-patent-rights-nclat-rules-cci-has-no-power-to-probe-patented-product-disputes-upholds-case-against-swiss-drugmaker-vifor/articleshow/125036633.cms,"



The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) has ruled that the Competition Commission of India (CCI) does not have the power to investigate disputes related to patented products, holding that the Patent Act takes precedence over the Competition Act in such cases, PTI reported.Dismissing an appeal against a CCI order that had closed a complaint against Swiss pharma major Vifor International (AG), a two-member NCLAT bench said that the fair trade regulator lacks jurisdiction to examine such matters, PTI reported.“Considering the judgment of the Delhi High Court in the case of Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson (PUBL) and the Supreme Court in SLP No. 25026/2023, it is apparent that the CCI lacks the power to examine the allegations made against Vifor International (AG),” the tribunal observed.Vifor International held the patent for Ferric Carboxymaltose (FCM) injection, a drug used to treat Iron Deficiency Anaemia (IDA). The tribunal stated: “The Patent Act will prevail over the Competition Act in the facts of this case, as the subject matter of contention is FCM, which was developed and patented by Respondent No. 2 (Vifor International).”NCLAT noted that Section 3(5) of the Competition Act provides specific protection to patent holders to restrain infringement or impose reasonable conditions to safeguard their rights.“The Competition Act, in Section 3(5), has laid down that the Act will not restrict the right of any person in protecting his rights under the Patent Act,” it said.The appeal was filed by Swapan Dey, CEO of a hospital offering free dialysis services under the Pradhan Mantri National Dialysis Programme (PMNDP). Dey alleged that Vifor’s “anti-competitive and abusive conduct” had made FCM injections unaffordable and inaccessible to patients.However, the CCI had closed the case in its October 25, 2022 order, finding no prima facie contravention under Sections 3(4) or 4 of the Competition Act. Dey then challenged the order before NCLAT, arguing that the CCI failed to properly define the relevant market or assess Vifor’s dominance.Vifor countered the claim, asserting that the CCI lacked jurisdiction since the matter involved a patented molecule governed by the Patent Act. The company also informed the tribunal that its patent for FCM, granted on June 25, 2008, had expired on October 21, 2023, making it freely available for manufacturing and sale.NCLAT held that while the patent’s expiry meant the drug had entered the public domain, the key question was jurisdiction—whether CCI could have examined the issue when the product was still under patent protection.Citing the Delhi High Court’s earlier decision in Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson (PUBL), which held that the Patent Act overrides the Competition Act, the tribunal noted that the Supreme Court had upheld that position by dismissing CCI’s appeal on September 2, 2025.“Following the judicial guidance as noted above, we hold that there is no merit in this appeal. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed,” NCLAT concluded.","The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) has ruled that the Competition Commission of India (CCI) does not have the power to investigate disputes related to patented products.

"US tariffs hit India’s export engine: GTRI report shows 37.5% slump across key sectors; smartphones, pharma, gems among worst hit",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/us-tariffs-hit-indias-export-engine-gtri-report-shows-37-5-slump-across-key-sectors-smartphones-pharma-gems-among-worst-hit/articleshow/125035433.cms,"'Unfair, Unjustified': Piyush Goyal Exposes US Tariff Logic, Says India Won’t Accept One-Sided Rules





India’s exports to the US plunged 37.5% between May and September 2025 as sweeping tariff hikes by the Trump administration squeezed margins across major sectors, according to a report by India-based trade think tank Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI), ANI reported.The US, India’s largest export market, saw shipments fall from $8.8 billion to $5.5 billion over the five-month period, marking one of the steepest short-term declines in recent years, GTRI said in its analysis. The study assessed India’s export performance from May to September 2025 to gauge the fallout from US tariffs imposed starting April 2.According to GTRI, the duties began at 10%, rose to 25% by August 7, and hit 50% by late August for Indian products. Tariff-free goods—making up nearly one-third of India’s total shipments—saw the steepest contraction, plunging 47% from $3.4 billion in May to $1.8 billion in September.“Smartphones and pharmaceuticals were the biggest casualties,” GTRI said. Smartphone exports, which had surged 197% in the same period a year earlier, crashed 58% from $2.29 billion in May to $884.6 million in September. Shipments fell consistently each month, and GTRI noted, “The reasons for decline are not known and need examination.”Pharmaceutical exports dropped 15.7%, from $745.6 million to $628.3 million, while industrial metals and auto parts—subject to uniform tariffs globally—recorded a milder 16.7% dip. Within that category, aluminium exports fell 37%, copper 25%, auto parts 12%, and iron and steel 8%.“Because all global suppliers faced similar duties, the dip appears linked more to a slowdown in US industrial activity than to any loss in Indian competitiveness,” GTRI said.Labour-intensive sectors such as textiles, gems and jewellery, chemicals, agri-foods, and machinery—which together make up nearly 60% of India’s US exports—recorded a 33% fall, from $4.8 billion in May to $3.2 billion in September. Gems and jewellery exports plunged 59.5%, from $500.2 million to $202.8 million, as Thailand and Vietnam captured lost US orders.Solar panel exports fell 60.8%, from $202.6 million to $79.4 million, undermining India’s renewable energy export edge. “With China facing only 30% tariffs and Vietnam 20%, India’s competitiveness has sharply deteriorated,” GTRI noted.The report also pointed to declines in chemicals, marine and seafood, textiles, and agri and processed food exports. “Exporters are urging the government to respond swiftly,” it added, suggesting priority measures such as enhanced interest-equalisation support, faster duty remission, and emergency credit lines for MSME exporters.Without urgent policy intervention, GTRI warned, India risks losing market share to Vietnam, Mexico, and China even in sectors where it previously held a strong position. “The latest data make one point clear: tariffs have not only squeezed India’s trade margins but also exposed structural vulnerabilities across key export industries,” the think tank concluded.","India’s exports to the US plunged 37.5% between May and September 2025.

NEW DELHI: Cyclone Montha, brewing over the Arabian Sea, is expected to intensify into a severe cyclonic storm and make landfall along the Andhra Pradesh coast between Machilipatnam and Kalingapatnam, near Kakinada, by Tuesday evening, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD).The name Montha meaning “beautiful” or “fragrant flower” was suggested by Thailand, one of the 13 member countries of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and UN ESCAP panel that governs cyclone naming in the North Indian Ocean region. Each name is used only once and never repeated.In the North Indian Ocean, which includes the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea, cyclone naming is managed by the WMO/ESCAP Panel on Tropical Cyclones. This panel includes 13 countries: India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Myanmar, Maldives, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Oman, Yemen, Iran, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates.Each member submits a list of names that reflect their culture, language, or natural environment. The names are then used sequentially whenever a new cyclone reaches the intensity required to be officially named by the India Meteorological Department (IMD), which acts as the Regional Specialized Meteorological Centre (RSMC) for this region.Each country has submitted 13 names, forming a list of 169 names used sequentially and alphabetically. Names are neutral to gender, politics, and religion. The first cyclone of this season, Shakhti, suggested by Sri Lanka, formed earlier this month in the Arabian Sea but spared the Indian coast.The cyclone is likely to bring heavy rain across Andhra Pradesh, Odisha and Tamil Nadu with red alerts issued for several coastal districts of Andhra Pradesh.After Montha, the next cyclones will be named Senyar (UAE), Ditwah (Yemen), Arnab (Bangladesh), and Murasu (India). The naming system began in 2004, following a decision by the WMO and ESCAP in 2000, to make communication about tropical storms simpler and more effective for public awareness and disaster management.","Cyclone Montha, brewing over the Arabian Sea, is expected to intensify into a severe cyclonic storm by October 28.

Are banks closed on October 28?



Other upcoming bank holidays in October 2025

With Diwali festivities concluded, many are in celebration mode for Chhath Puja, leaving people uncertain about whether banks are open or closed on October 28, Tuesday. The month of October has seen a series of festival holidays, ranging from Navratri, Vijayadashmi to Diwali and Lakshmi Pujan.Bank holidays vary from state to state as the celebration is region-specific. Banks in Bihar and Jharkhand are closed today for Chhath Puja (Morning Puja). While branches in other regions will continue to function normally, those in 2 states mentioned above will stay closed.However, even if physical branches are closed, customers can use online banking and digital payment platforms to complete any necessary transactions during the holiday.People celebrate Chhath Puja, which is dedicated to the Sun God (Surya) and Chhathi Maiya, in states like Bihar, Jharkhand, and eastern Uttar Pradesh. Devout people mark the festival by praying to the sun as it rises and sets, expressing gratitude and asking for blessings for health, prosperity, and well-being.: In observance of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel's birth anniversary, Banks in Gujarat will be closed on October 31.Additionally, according to the RBI calendar, on the second and fourth Saturdays of every month, as well as on Sundays, all scheduled and non-scheduled banks are closed.Bank holidays do not stop customers from accessing their accounts or completing transactions, as most services remain available through online banking, ATMs, mobile apps, and UPI for fund transfers, bill payments, and balance inquiries. However, in-person services like large cash deposits, cheque clearances, and demand drafts will not be available.","Banks in Bihar and Jharkhand are closed today for Chhath Puja (Morning Puja) Customers can use online banking and digital payment platforms to complete any necessary transactions during the holiday.

"Oil output move: Opec+ announces fresh 137,000 bpd hike from December; aims to protect market share amid US shale slowdown",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/oil-output-move-opec-announces-fresh-137000-bpd-hike-from-december-aims-to-protect-market-share-amid-us-shale-slowdown/articleshow/125037966.cms,"



The eight key members of the Opec+ alliance, including Saudi Arabia and Russia, have agreed to raise oil production by 137,000 barrels per day (bpd) starting December, marking a modest increase that will hold steady for three months, the group said in a statement after a virtual meeting on Sunday, AFP reported.The move, aligned with analyst expectations, represents a pause in the series of monthly hikes that began in April, as the group — known as the Voluntary Eight (V8) — seeks to consolidate market share amid steady oil prices and waning US shale output.Since April, the V8 — comprising Saudi Arabia, Russia, Iraq, the UAE, Kuwait, Kazakhstan, Algeria and Oman — has raised output by about 2.7 million bpd. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies (Opec+) had accelerated production at an unexpectedly fast pace this year after years of supply cuts designed to bolster prices.Analysts see the latest move as a strategic effort to defend market position against US producers. “Supply by US shale producers is not increasing anymore, it’s going sideways,” said Ole Hvalbye, commodities analyst at SEB Bank, noting “less investment in new US production.”The V8 cited “low oil inventories” as justification for the output rise. According to the US Energy Information Administration (EIA), US crude inventories have fallen sharply, keeping Brent crude prices steady near $65 per barrel.However, analysts warned that additional supply could pressure prices. “An increase in Opec+ quotas of 137,000 barrels would result in lower actual production, limiting the impact on prices,” said Emily Ashford of Standard Chartered Bank.Some members, including Russia, may face constraints due to overproduction in previous months. The latest US sanctions on Russian oil giants Rosneft and Lukoil have further clouded the outlook.“The market is underestimating what it means when you have US sanctions against two large Russian companies,” said Patrick Pouyanne, CEO of TotalEnergies, suggesting that potential supply disruptions could buoy prices.Yet, analysts cautioned that Russia’s ability to circumvent sanctions and China’s continued oil purchases may limit the overall impact of the US measures.","The eight key members of the Opec+ alliance, including Saudi Arabia and Russia, have agreed to raise oil production by 137,000 barrels per day starting December.

Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney on Saturday highlighted his country’s “progress” in building partnerships with India and other Asia-Pacific nations, even as tensions with the United States escalate over tariffs.His remarks came days after US President Donald Trump terminated all trade talks with Canada, accusing Ottawa of “egregious behaviour”, reported PTI.Speaking to reporters after the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in South Korea, Carney said, “There is no better place to build new partnerships than in the fastest growing part of the world that represents 60 per cent of the global economy.”Referring to developments in the region, he cited the free trade deal with Indonesia, ongoing talks with the Philippines and Thailand, and a “turning point” in relations with China.“Progress which we have been making with India… So I didn't meet directly with Prime Minister (Narendra) Modi here, (but) the foreign minister, other ministers have been meeting with India,” Carney said, adding that his government is focused on “reducing reliance on the United States” by diversifying trade partnerships.""That's what we're doing to build our strength at home, first and foremost. Build these partnerships abroad, reduce our reliance on the United States.It can't happen overnight, but we're moving very fast,” he added.Carney also apologised to President Trump earlier this week for an anti-tariff television advertisement released by Ontario’s provincial government.The ad, which reassembled excerpts from a 1987 speech by former US President Ronald Reagan, had prompted Trump to accuse Canada of interference and announce an additional 10% tariff on Canadian exports.Carney confirmed he apologised to Trump during a dinner at the APEC summit, saying, “It’s not something I would have done... and so I apologised to him.” He emphasised that trade relations are the federal government’s domain, not provincial leaders’.Carney’s comments follow Canadian foreign minister Anita Anand’s visit to India last month, during which both countries unveiled a roadmap to expand cooperation in trade, energy and critical minerals — part of efforts to restore ties strained by the 2023 killing of a Sikh separatist, reported PTI.Despite the diplomatic rift with Washington, Carney expressed optimism that trade talks could resume once conditions stabilise.",Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney highlighted his country’s “progress” in building partnerships with India and other Asia-Pacific nations.

AI AI Yo! Two desi lads in Silicon Valley become youngest self-made billionaires at 22,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/ai-ai-yo-two-desi-lads-in-silicon-valley-become-youngest-self-made-billionaires-at-22-indian-americans/articleshow/125037527.cms,"From left, Adarsh Hiremath, Brendan Foody, and Surya Midha (Image credit: NYT News Service)

TOI correspondent from Washington:





In a stunning testament to the boom in Artificial Intelligence (AI), three 22-year-old high school friends from Silicon Valley, including two Indian-Americans, have become the world's youngest self-made billionaires.Brendan Foody, Adarsh Hiremath, and Surya Midha, co-founders of the San Francisco-based AI recruiting platform Mercor, achieved the staggering feat after their company recently secured $350 million in funding, valuing the firm at $10 billion. This milestone dethrones Meta co-founder Mark Zuckerberg, who became a billionaire at 23.The $10 billion valuation gives each of the three founders, who hold roughly 22 percent stakes, a net worth exceeding $2 billion. Foody is the CEO of the company; Hiremath, whose parents emigrated from Karnataka, is the CTO; and Midha, whose parents emigrated from New Delhi, is the board chairman.The trio's journey began at Bellarmine College Preparatory, an all-boys Jesuit school in San Jose, where they bonded over late-night preparations for national debate tournaments. The skills they honed—rapid-fire analysis and persuasive logic—would later become the bedrock of their entrepreneurial success.""We were always arguing about the future of work,"" Foody recalled in a recent Forbes interview.After high school, the friends scattered to elite universities: Foody to Georgetown for economics, Hiremath to Harvard for computer science, and Midha to Georgetown for foreign service, before they were reunited by the start-up siren call of Silicon Valley.In early 2023, during their sophomore years, they launched Mercor even while they were apart. The initial idea was simple: an online freelance marketplace to bridge the talent gap by connecting skilled software engineers in India -- where coders are plentiful -- with cash-strapped U.S. startups hungry for remote help. However, it quickly pivoted, fueled by the explosive demand for ""human-in-the-loop"" services needed to refine foundational AI models like ChatGPT.Evolding into an AI-powered platform that automates recruitment while delivering a global network of vetted contractors, Mercor now boasts over 30,000 specialists worldwide -- in fields ranging from law and medicine to finance and engineering -- who are paid to label data, simulate scenarios, and inject the nuanced human judgment algorithms cannot replicate. Clients, including OpenAI, Anthropic, Google DeepMind, and six of the ""Magnificent Seven"" tech giants, use the platform to source the talent needed to turn raw compute into smarter AI.The lean operation is run by a 30-person team whose median age is just 22. Hiremath's 2035 vision for Mercor is to have built a unified global labor marketplace, matching every person to every job or task in a seamless way.The company’s growth has been dizzying. By mid-2024, Mercor hit a $500 million in annualized revenue, up from $100 million just months earlier. The founders, all recipients of the Thiel Fellowship's $100,000 grant for skipping college, accelerated their funding rounds at a breakneck pace. A $32 million Series A in September 2024 valued them at $250 million, and a $100 million Series B in February 2025 sent the valuation soaring to $2 billion, leading VC-watchers to call it the fastest growing start-up in Silicon Valley.The final turbocharge came this summer: a $14.3 billion acquisition of Mercor's main rival, Scale AI, by Meta paved the way for even faster growth for the upstart start-up. Wary of conflicts, major AI labs like OpenAI and DeepMind turned en masse to Mercor for a neutral alternative. Another $350 million Series C infusion this week bumped them into the billionaire’s club, based on Mercor’s valuation.","Brendan Foody, Adarsh Hiremath, and Surya Midha, co-founders of the San Francisco-based AI recruiting platform Mercor, achieved the staggering feat after their company recently secured $350 million in funding.

Building the AI-First Future: Inside Tau Ventures with Amit Garg,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/building-the-ai-first-future-inside-tau-ventures-with-amit-garg/articleshow/125030730.cms,"



When Amit Garg and his co-founder Sanjay Rao started pitching their AI-first venture fund in 2019, they got an unexpected question: “Do you think it's a big enough thesis?”“Nobody asks us that question anymore,” Garg laughs.That moment captures something essential about Tau Ventures: A willingness to bet on the future before it’s obvious to everyone else. After working together at Norwest Ventures 15 years ago and staying in touch through a decade of building and investing, Garg and Rao finally launched their fund at what they saw as the inflection point for AI.They were right.With $93 million under management across three funds, they’re deliberately small. The numbers are interesting: they see 6K deals a year and invest in one per month. About 0.2% of companies get funded. Yet 98% of their portfolio companies go on to raise the next round. Their portfolio includes names like Assort, Labelbox, and Iterative, alongside a steady stream of early-stage innovators redefining healthcare and enterprise AI.We can’t do justice to every company that’s coming to us,” Garg admits.But the ones that make it through (companies led by US-based CEOs, typically one to three years old, focused on healthcare or enterprise AI) get something more valuable than just capital.Tau's investment approach is refreshingly straightforward. They call it “n plus 1”: Make an initial bet and then double down on the winners. In their first fund, half went to initial checks and half to follow-ons. But those follow-ons were concentrated in the companies returning 10x or more.“From an LP perspective, from a return perspective, that means we take a lower risk with a higher return,” Garg explains. Also, if a portfolio company drops below six months of runway, it’s all hands on deck with finding customers, connecting investors, and extending the runway. Sometimes the best outcome is finding the right acquirer. Tau has helped numerous companies find homes, protecting the downside while shooting for the upside.Ask Garg what he looks for in founders, and you won’t get a checklist. Credentials help (the right schools, the right companies, the right experience), but those are pluses, not requirements.“What we do look for is aptitude. Do you have the ability to learn? Will you work well with us? But would you also have the conviction to go build something that’s kind of crazy, that’s against the odds?”It's a paradox he's comfortable with: entrepreneurial hubris combined with humility. The confidence to believe you can succeed paired with the self-awareness to know you might fail.While other VCs talk about their networks, Tau has built something more tangible: a community of over 5K investors on their mailing list, with posts regularly hitting 100K views. LPs can co-invest directly alongside Tau with no management fee or carry as well. “It’s a team sport,” Garg emphasizes. “It’s not about you being the only one taking the risk. It’s you with others, working as a team, with advisors, a whole ecosystem built of people who are invested and vested in the success of a vision. ”Garg’s personal passion is digital health, and the timing couldn’t be better. Healthcare is now the number-one industry adopting AI, driven by mounting pressures on a system that severely underserves patients.With an undergraduate degree in computer science and biology, a master’s in biomedical informatics, and experience as both founder and investor in digital health, Garg has been waiting for this moment for a long time. His background includes research on tau proteins implicated in Alzheimer’s (part of the inspiration for the fund’s name).What’s striking about Garg is how deeply he embeds learning into everything. VC, he explains, is almost by definition for people who are curious and lifelong learners. Every meeting is a chance to learn from someone who knows more about their particular domain, someone with dreams they’re actively building.But there's a balance: curiosity paired with conviction. “There’s a thousand reasons to say no,” Garg notes. “But there’s usually one reason to say yes.”The name Tau comes from the Greek letter, carrying meanings across mathematics, physics, biology, and astronomy. It’s a better representation of the circle in mathematics. It’s tied to proteins in Alzheimer’s research. It represents time and speed in astronomy. It’s layered and meaningful choice that reflects how Garg approaches everything else.Six years in, with a portfolio spanning healthcare and enterprise AI, Tau Ventures has carved out a distinctive position. “We are still in the early innings, by the way,” Garg emphasizes. “There's a lot more ahead of us.”With agents becoming the new focus and tomorrow promising something different still, Tau’s philosophy of constant learning and unlearning seems perfectly suited for AI’s exponential trajectory.For founders with the right combination of aptitude and grit, for LPs seeking both returns and community, and for anyone curious about where AI is heading next, Tau Ventures offers a clear point of view backed by consistent execution.And unlike 2019, nobody's asking anymore if it’s a big enough thesis.",Amit Garg and Sanjay Rao are the co-founders of Tau Ventures.

H-1B visa LCA submissions: FLAG system back online; employers can resume foreign hiring applications,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/h-1b-visa-lca-submissions-flag-system-back-online-employers-can-resume-foreign-hiring-applications/articleshow/125029056.cms,"'American Dream Stolen': India in the Spotlight as Trump’s H-1B Visa Misuse Ad Sparks Controversy

What is OFLC?

Why was the system paused earlier?





Backlogs and more load—What can employers expect





Employers in the United States can once again submit applications for H-1B, H-2A, H-2B and PERM visa programs to hire foreign workers after the Department of Labor restored processing through its Foreign Labor Application Gateway (FLAG) system.The Office of Foreign Labor Certification (OFLC) confirmed that the platform is active and operational, enabling employers to file new applications, track pending cases, and move stalled filings towards decisions.With the system back online, the Department has resumed processing requests for prevailing wages and labour certification determinations for both temporary and permanent employment.In its announcement, the department said, “The Office of Foreign Labor Certification’s (OFLC) Foreign Labor Application Gateway (FLAG) system is now accessible and permits system users to prepare and submit new applications as well as submit and receive information associated with their applications pending a final determination.”It added, “We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and appreciate your patience as OFLC transitions back to full operational status.”The OFLC handles the labour certification step that US employers must complete before hiring foreign workers under visa programs such as H-1B, H-2A, H-2B and PERM, according to ET.These applications are processed through the FLAG portal, which is the official online system used for filing, uploading supporting documents and monitoring application status.The portal also links to SeasonalJobs.dol.gov, where temporary positions certified under the H-2A and H-2B programmes are listed.With no OFLC approval, employers cannot move ahead with employment-based visa petitions to the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS).The shutdown that halted processing earlier in the year occurred because federal funding lapsed, triggering a government-wide freeze on various operations. When the Department of Labor’s allocation expired around September 30, this year, the OFLC suspended activity and both the FLAG portal and SeasonalJobs.dol.gov went offline.During the outage, employers could not file new applications, update existing ones or submit labour condition applications, prevailing wage requests or PERM filings. The department clarified that the pause had no connection to its ongoing system modernisation as the halt was directly linked to the funding lapse.Even before the shutdown, the agency was already facing a heavy queue. As of July 2025, applications submitted as early as March 2024 were still waiting to be reviewed. With services now restored, the OFLC has warned of slower turnaround times as it works through accumulated filings, ET reported.With the FLAG portal operational again, employers may resume filing labour condition applications for H-1B cases and PERM labour certifications. Those who already have submissions in progress should expect extended processing times until operations stabilise. The department has urged applicants to continue monitoring official OFLC channels for updates on system performance and processing timelines.","The Department of Labor has restored processing through its Foreign Labor Application Gateway (FLAG) system.

Explained: How an Indian-origin entrepreneur 'borrowed' $500 million from the world's biggest asset manager,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/explained-how-an-indian-origin-entrepreneur-borrowed-500-million-from-the-worlds-biggest-asset-manager/articleshow/125019184.cms,"customers didn’t exist.

The Discovery: A Suspicious Email and a Locked Office



The Method: How the Fraud Worked



Here’s how Brahmbhatt did it:

Fake customers: He invented telecom clients that didn’t exist.

Fake invoices : He created bills showing those clients owed millions.

: He created bills showing those clients owed millions. Fake confirmations: He built lookalike domains and sent “proof” emails to lenders.

Real money: He used the fake receivables to get real loans from HPS and BNP Paribas.

Offshore transfers: Some pledged assets were quietly moved to accounts in India and Mauritius.

The Fallout: BlackRock’s $500 Million Lesson



The Bigger Picture: When Easy Money Meets Easy Lies



The Vanishing Act



In Simple Terms



What happened? A telecom CEO faked invoices and customers to borrow $500 million.

Who got fooled? BlackRock’s lending arm HPS Investment Partners and co-lender BNP Paribas.

How was it caught? An analyst noticed suspicious customer emails.

What’s the damage? Bankrupt companies, hundreds of millions in losses, and lawsuits.





Imagine running a small telecom company and convincing the world’s biggest asset manager, BlackRock, that your business is booming. That’s what Indian-origin entrepreneur Bankim Brahmbhatt allegedly managed to do.Through his companies — Broadband Telecom, Bridgevoice, and Carriox Capital — Brahmbhatt borrowed more than $500 million from private-credit lenders led by HPS Investment Partners, a firm recently acquired by BlackRock. The collateral he offered sounded solid: accounts receivable, or money his companies were supposedly owed by customers.The problem? ThoseAccording to court filings, nearly every invoice, email, and contract he provided was fake. He had built an empire on paper — complete with forged emails and invoices from imaginary telecom clients.The scheme unravelled by accident.In July, an HPS employee noticed that some customer emails confirming Brahmbhatt’s invoices looked strange. They came from addresses like @bics-telecom.com instead of the real @bics.com. When auditors investigated, they found that every customer email used to verify invoices over the past two years was fake.Some of the supposed clients had never even heard of him.When lenders raised the issue, Brahmbhatt assured them there was “nothing to worry about” — then stopped answering calls.An investigator sent to his New York office found it locked and deserted. His nearby home was another scene out of a movie: two BMWs, a Porsche, a Tesla and an Audi parked neatly outside, and packages left unopened on the porch.This wasn’t a classic Ponzi scheme or crypto scam. It was something quieter, hidden inside the machinery of modern finance. Brahmbhatt tapped into a system called asset-based lending, where loans are given against business income or customer payments. In theory, it’s low-risk. In practice, it’s easy to game.It was a symphony of forgery, spreadsheets, and confidence — the kind of scam that works best when no one expects it.When the truth came out, Brahmbhatt’s companies filed for bankruptcy in August. BNP Paribas, which helped fund the loans, added around $220 million to its loan-loss provisions. HPS told its investors that while the hit was painful, it wouldn’t threaten its $179 billion portfolio.Still, the embarrassment was enormous. The world’s most sophisticated asset manager had been duped by forged PDFs and fake emails.Private credit — lending by funds instead of banks — has exploded in recent years. It’s fast, profitable, and lightly regulated. But the Brahmbhatt case shows just how fragile it can be.Two other collapses this year, in the US auto industry, had already raised alarms. Companies like First Brands and Tricolor were accused of doing the same thing: inflating assets and pledging fiction as collateral. Brahmbhatt simply took that playbook global.This wasn’t a story about high finance. It was a story about trust — and how quickly it can be sold.As of now, Bankim Brahmbhatt’s whereabouts remain unclear. His lawyer says he denies any wrongdoing. HPS believes he’s in India. His personal bankruptcy, filed the same day as his companies’, adds a strange symmetry to the scandal — the man and his empire collapsing together.Where is he now? Missing.It wasn’t a hacker or a rogue algorithm that fooled Wall Street this time. It was a man with a spreadsheet, a smile, and a very good understanding of how belief works. The real trick wasn’t inventing fake customers. It was convincing everyone that no one needed to check.","Indian-origin entrepreneur Bankim Brahmbhatt allegedly managed to borrow more than $500 million from private-credit lenders.

Chip export thaw: China exempts some Nexperia products from ban; signals easing with Europe,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/chip-export-thaw-china-exempts-some-nexperia-products-from-ban-signals-easing-with-europe/articleshow/125018083.cms,"



China on Saturday said it will exempt certain Nexperia semiconductor products from an export ban imposed amid a dispute with Dutch authorities, signalling a partial easing of tensions that had alarmed European businesses.Anxiety over potential chip shortages had mounted after the Netherlands invoked a Cold War-era law in late September to take control of Nexperia, whose parent company Wingtech is backed by the Chinese government, AFP reported. Beijing responded by banning any re-exports of Nexperia chips to Europe and accused the United States of interfering in Dutch legal procedures to oust the Chinese CEO of the firm.China’s commerce ministry said in a statement that it would “comprehensively consider the actual situation of enterprises and grant exemptions to exports that meet the criteria,” though it did not specify which chips would be covered.The Wall Street Journal reported that the partial resumption of Nexperia shipments formed part of a trade deal agreed between Chinese President Xi Jinping and US President Donald Trump after talks in South Korea on Thursday.The announcement came as Chinese and European Union officials held talks in Brussels on Friday to discuss export controls and supply chain issues. EU spokesman Olof Gill said the discussions provided “a welcome opportunity for both sides to update on the introduction and implementation of export controls,” including China’s restrictions on rare earth elements.Berlin welcomed Beijing’s move as a “positive sign”. “The latest reports from China are positive initial signs of an easing of tensions,” a spokesman for Germany’s economy ministry told AFP, while adding that “a final assessment” of the decision’s implications was still pending.Nexperia produces components such as diodes, transistors, and voltage regulators that are widely used in the automotive and electronics industries. The company manufactures most of its products in Europe, sends them to China for finishing, and re-exports them to European clients.European carmakers and parts suppliers had warned that prolonged restrictions on Nexperia components could disrupt production lines.

Will this ease the pressure on their economies?

Too late for the soybean agreement

US labour market continues to weaken

China has deeper woes

No signed deal yet





During their latest meeting in South Korea, US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping managed to cool the intense trade stand-off between their countries briefly.The two leaders reached a provisional deal: the US would trim tariffs on Chinese goods by 10%, bringing the rate down to 47%, while China would pause its export curbs on rare earth minerals and increase purchases of American soybeans.Trump hailed the talks as “a great success,” adding that he will visit China in April next year, with Xi expected to travel to the US soon after.However, even after the temporary truce, the bigger question still looms.Though China no longer faces a threat of Trump's 100% tariffs and US gets to sell its soybeans, there is a bigger picture.Among the hardest hit by the tariff tussle are American soybean farmers. The commodity, the country’s largest agricultural export, has been effectively shut out of China since May, when higher tariffs triggered an embargo.Until this week, China had not placed a single new order.The timing of this breakthrough may be too late for many growers.Peak harvest season is already under way, and months of muted demand already forced farmers to sell their crops at lower prices, CNN reported.Though Trump has promised that China will purchase “tremendous amounts” of soybeans, but the financial damage has already been done for producers who needed revenue weeks ago.The US job market, which had begun losing momentum before Trump returned to office, has slowed even further. Hiring has tapered off as companies hold back expansion plans due to tariff uncertainty, and layoffs are becoming more common. For the first time in several years, there are now more unemployed workers than job openings, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.Technology shifts are adding pressure. Artificial intelligence is contributing to job cuts across multiple sectors, including a wave of redundancies at Amazon this week. Policymakers warn that monetary tools are unlikely to solve the problem, CNN reported.Federal Reserve governor Christopher Waller stressed that “if AI constitutes a structural shift in the demand for labor, monetary policy will not be an effective tool.”Rate cuts could also push inflation higher, at a moment when the cost of goods and services is already rising, affected both by tariffs and tighter immigration rules that have reduced labour supply in farming and childcare.Despite resilient export performance during Trump’s global tariff offensive, China’s longstanding domestic problems show no sign of improvement. The country continues to grapple with a protracted property downturn, deflation pressures, weak consumer sentiment and high youth unemployment.Louise Loo, head of Asia economics at Oxford Economics, told CNN that the revised trade terms offer limited upside, saying that “beyond a cyclical impulse, it’s hard to see today’s revised trade terms as materially shifting China’s more structural challenges at home, where we think tariffs are, if anything, fading in macro relevance.”The fentanyl-related tariff reduction included in the deal may add only a “marginal” 0.2% to China’s growth forecast next year, she added.Economic indicators reinforce the gloom. China’s factory-gate prices dropped for the 36th consecutive month in September. Retail sales rose just 3% year-on-year, the slowest pace in 10 months, and new home prices posted their sharpest fall in nearly a year. Even China’s electric vehicle industry is stuck in a downward price spiral caused by excess capacity.For now, the understanding between the leaders is only a draft. Final details require further negotiations, and there is no guarantee that the agreement will be formalised.What has been taken off the table, at least temporarily, is Trump’s threat to impose a 100% tariff on Chinese exports, a move that would almost certainly have prompted retaliation from Beijing.","The US and China have reached a provisional deal on trade.

President said that a private donor, identified by media reports as billionaire , provided funds to maintain military pay, CBS News reported. Up to $14 billion economic loss: The CBO warns that a shutdown lasting eight weeks or more would permanently erase $14 billion from GDP.





The United States is nearing the longest federal government shutdown in history, having remained closed for the entire month with no resolution in sight.Economists have warned that the longer the impasse drags on, the greater the risk that the economy, already showing signs of strain, could shift from bending to breaking.“The economy is fragile and, therefore, something like a government shutdown could become a bigger problem a lot faster than people might think,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, as quoted by CNN.Fresh estimates released this week by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) show the shutdown has already shaved off at least $7 billion in economic output permanently. Furthermore, the economic damage will rise the longer the shutdown continues, with losses reaching $11 billion after six weeks, and $14 billion if it stretches to eight weeks.Diane Swonk, chief economist at KPMG, compared the cascading effects to a snowball gathering mass, “That’s kind of like a snowball rolling down a hill, gathering momentum and mass.”The shutdown comes on top of an already weak labour market, defined by low hiring, low firing and minimal movement. Employers have been delaying investments and staffing decisions because of financial and policy uncertainty, while some companies have begun testing artificial intelligence and automation, resulting in mass layoffs.“We’re not creating any jobs of consequence, really,” Zandi said.As the job market is already weak, the small number of jobs being added could turn into actual job losses. If government support systems weaken, federal workers miss paychecks, and people spend less money, businesses might start firing workers or closing down.A report by the US Chamber of Commerce cited by CNN suggested that 65,500 small business contractors have $12 billion worth of payments at risk this month due to paused government operations.Nicole Bachaud, labour economist at ZipRecruiter, said that the interest rate cuts and trade clarity were expected to boost hiring in 2026 and that momentum could be derailed.“However, tariffs are projected to dampen consumer spending before year’s end, and a prolonged shutdown could further erode consumer confidence,” she wrote. The Conference Board’s latest index reflects that trend, showing consumer sentiment at its lowest level since April.The political deadlock hinges on the expiry of enhanced subsidies under the Affordable Care Act. Democrats insist the funding bill must extend the subsidies; Republicans refuse to discuss it until the government reopens.Open enrollment begins 1 November, and without renewed subsidies, 22 million Americans using the federal marketplace could see premiums spike by 26% on average, according to a KFF analysis, quoted by CNN.That same day, more than 65,000 children and families in 41 states and Puerto Rico risk losing access to Head Start early education programmes.Temporary closures would add financial pressure on low-income households and lead to immediate childcare disruptions, a factor known to weigh on workforce participation, particularly for women.Economists warn that delayed or cancelled spending, job hires, travel, even holiday shopping, may not return later.“And this isn’t economic activity that is just deferred or delayed, you’re now creating a condition of economic activity that just simply doesn’t happen,” said Joe Brusuelas, RSM US chief economist.Zandi added that the broader economy reaches a critical stage when confidence begins to crack, “When this thing really metastasizes and takes out the broader economy is when it starts to affect confidence – consumer, business, investor confidence – the stock market takes notice and instead of going straight up, it starts to wobble and starts going down.” If the shutdown stretches beyond Thanksgiving, he warned, “there’s no coming back from that quickly. ”A prolonged stalemate may also influence inflation and interest rate decisions. Disruptions could push some prices higher, but weaker demand could pull inflation lower.“The net of all that, I think, is hard to know,” Zandi told CNN, noting the Federal Reserve may feel more pressure to continue cutting rates as the job market suffers.“The Fed’s putting a higher weight at this point on the weak job market than they are on inflation or financial conditions.”He further added that this shutdown would weaken the already fragile job market more.Millions relying on federal aid programmes, including food assistance under SNAP, face increasing uncertainty. For many households already struggling with inflation, any delay in government support could deepen hardship.Zandi said that majority of the Americans are “not taking any solace from the fact that AI stocks are going stratospheric; they’re focused on having to make their credit card payment or the student loan monthly payment.’”“It just adds insult to injury on an economy that was already showing some cracks,” Swonk said, adding, “Low- and middle-income households are really struggling, and inequality tends to stoke political divisions as well as political backlash. So, this is just feeding in to already a not very comfortable situation that we are in.”“It’s hard when you see the struggles we’re already facing, but this is a man-made problem,” she said.The shutdown entered October after Congress failed yet again to agree on a temporary funding bill. The House passed a measure on 19 September to keep the government open until 21 November, but it stalled immediately in the Republican-controlled Senate.It is now the second-longest shutdown in US history, just days short of the 34-day standoff of 2018–2019.","The United States is nearing the longest federal government shutdown in history, having remained closed for the entire month with no resolution in sight.Economists have warned that the longer the impasse drags on, the greater the risk that the economy, already showing signs of strain, could shift from bending to breaking.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125009915,imgsize-792185,width-400,resizemode-4/file-photo.jpg"

Trump’s relations with CBS





Going downhill

Settling the feud

A new chapter





Months after US President Donald Trump settled a $16 million lawsuit with CBS News, he is set to return to “60 Minutes” this Sunday, marking his first appearance on the programme since the dispute.CBS confirmed that Norah O’Donnell conducted the interview at Mar-a-Lago on Friday. The network has, however, not disclosed how this week’s interview was arranged, nor whether any terms were set in advance.Although O’Donnell, although is a former “CBS Evening News” anchor, she is not among the regular correspondents of “60 Minutes”.The interview will be aired this Sunday, according to AP.The president's relationship with the network and with the long-running newsmagazine, has been turbulent.Back in run-up to the 2020 election, Trump abruptly ended an interview with correspondent Lesley Stahl, accusing the show of bias, and later his team released an unedited transcript.Despite repeated overtures from the programme, he did not sit for an interview during the 2024 campaign. Trump would later accuse “60 Minutes” of editing its interview with Kamala Harris “deceptively” to present her more favourably.Though CBS News denied the claim, maintaining that the Harris interview was edited according to routine editorial standards, Trump responded with legal action. He demanded the network $10 billion in damages but then raised the demand to $20 billion.Although legal experts largely dismissed Trump’s lawsuit as meritless and unlikely to stand because of constitutional press protections, Paramount chose to pursue mediation instead, a move made as the company was working to close its $8 billion merger with Skydance.The matter was resolved when Paramount, the network’s parent company, paid Trump $16 million, back in July, to settle the case. The payment came weeks before the Federal Communications Commission approved Paramount’s merger with Skydance Media, led by new CEO David Ellison.The lawsuit had internal consequences at CBS. Bill Owens, the executive producer of “60 Minutes”, stepped down in the spring, saying he could no longer run the programme independently. This was followed by the resignation of CBS News chief executive Wendy McMahon in May.Although Paramount did not apologise or acknowledge any fault, the company agreed as part of the settlement to release transcripts of future “60 Minutes” interviews with presidential candidates.Trump has been signalling improved relations with the broadcaster, since David Ellison assumed control at Paramount this summer. Ellison is the son of Larry Ellison, a prominent Trump supporter.Under his leadership, the company hired Kenneth Weinstein, the former head of a conservative think tank and a donor to Trump’s 2024 campaign, to review complaints alleging bias in the network’s journalism.During a flight home from the Middle East on October 12, Trump supported Ellisons’ role in the reshaped media landscape. “Larry Ellison is great, and his son David is great. They're friends of mine. They're big supporters of mine, and they'll do the right thing,” he told reporters.Paramount has also expanded its footprint in political and opinion media. In October, the company purchased the Free Press website and appointed its founder, Bari Weiss, as editor-in-chief of CBS News.Weiss is reported to have helped secure a recent “60 Minutes” segment featuring Jared Kushner and Trump associate Steve Witkoff discussing the Gaza peace deal.",US President Donald Trump set to return to '60 Minutes' this Sunday. It will be his first appearance on the programme since he settled a $16 million lawsuit with CBS News.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.","Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain.

Minuscule AI startup raises $41 million to tap India growth,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/minuscule-ai-startup-raises-41-million-to-tap-india-growth/articleshow/105804471.cms,"A generative artificial intelligence startup targeting the Indian market raised $41 million in fresh funding, the largest such round by an early-stage AI contender in the country.Sarvam AI is building large language models targeted at unique uses in Indian languages at price points that the country’s 1.4 billion people can afford. The Series A funding round was led by Lightspeed Venture Partners, and participants included Silicon Valley billionaire Vinod Khosla’s Khosla Ventures and Peak XV Partners, formerly Sequoia Capital India & Southeast Asia, Sarvam said Thursday.The Bangalore-based startup, until recently in stealth mode, was co-founded by Vivek Raghavan and Pratyush Kumar. It has ambitious plans to build open source foundational AI systems as well as tools for creating apps for the meager compute infrastructure available to developers in India. The startup has a total of 18 employees and is just opening an office in the city.""What we are showing is that you can build large language models with limited resources,” Raghavan said in a phone interview. ""We are building at a smaller scale and demonstrating that these can be extremely cost and energy efficient so they can be accessed by everyone.""Large language models, like OpenAI’s GPT-4 and Meta Platforms Inc.’s Llama, are powerful AI systems that understand by learning from vast amounts of diverse data from the internet and elsewhere to summarize, translate, and create text, audio and video for a wide range of applications. The rivalry to develop ever-more sophisticated models is heating up in Silicon Valley and such efforts have attracted billions of dollars in investments.","Sarvam AI is building large language models targeted at unique uses in Indian languages.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor ( CEA ) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran Udaan until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021.

That kind of digital-led wholesale business still accounts for a very small part of India’s overall retail market but can balloon to $150 billion in sales and yield a 100% return on capital invested in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co. estimates published in the Mint newspaper.Bengaluru-based Udaan has also ventured into financing through its fintech unit which helps shopkeepers get working capital loans to buy inventory. That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says.

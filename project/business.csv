UBS has revised its emerging markets equity strategy , shifting to a more defensive and domestically-oriented approach amidst growing trade uncertainties. The global brokerage has elevated India's status to 'Neutral' from 'Underweight', whilst maintaining its favourable stance towards China within emerging markets.The step forms part of a broader strategic shift favouring markets characterised by stable earnings, domestic revenue streams and defensive attributes. UBS notes that whilst India demonstrates several positive characteristics—strong domestic focus, robust earnings even during crises, and benefits from reduced oil prices—these factors are insufficient to warrant an 'Overweight' position.The firm has strategically moved away from globally exposed investments towards markets dominated by local dynamics. Their evaluation framework now prioritises markets displaying earnings per share stability, minimal exposure to global trade disruptions, and positive analyst perspectives. Within this framework, China and Indonesia present more attractive investment destinations.Also Read | Gold prices hit Rs 1 lakh!

Explained The upgraded Indian position reflects recognition of its fundamental strengths, although UBS remains measured in its approach. The brokerage maintains China's superior positioning over India supported by four key considerations:UBS expresses concerns about India's corporate earnings scenario.The analysis indicates weak stock fundamentals, highlighting significant reductions in earnings per share (EPS) whilst noting a disparity between positive macroeconomic discussions and actual earnings performance.Despite India's political stability and robust domestic narrative, UBS indicates uncertainty regarding ""whether the government focus is returning to growth/investments anytime soon"". This suggests that additional clarity might be necessary before market reassessment.UBS maintains reservations about India's position in global supply chain reorganisation.

According to Bajaj Broking Research, Lemon Treel Hotels and Electrosteel Castings are the top stock picks for today. Here’s its view on Nifty, Bank Nifty and the top stock picks for April 25, 2025:

Index View: NIFTY

NIFTY BANK

Bank Nifty after a strong rally of 5,800 points or 11% in just seven sessions, witnessed marginal profit booking in the last two sessions. The recent rally was led by robust institutional accumulation in frontline banking counters and a notable revival in FII inflows—reflecting a clear risk-on undertone. Rate cut hopes and positive results of the large cap private Banks boosted sentiment. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has issued the final guidelines on the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR), significantly easing norms and providing a substantial boost to system-wide liquidity thus helping to improve sentiments for the financial companies.

Bank Nifty has rallied to a fresh all time high and has generated a breakout above 7 months broader range (54,450-48,000). It has also registered a faster retracement of the five-month correction in just two months, signaling renewed strength.

Daily stochastic has approached overbought territory after an 11% rally in just 7 sessions. Hence, failure to move above 56,000 levels will lead to some consolidation in the range of 54,400-56,000 in the coming sessions. The immediate support base is placed at 54,000-54,400 levels, being the Monday’s gap area and the recent major breakout area.

While a breakout above 56,000 levels will open upwards towards 56,800 zones in the coming weeks. Additionally, the Bank Nifty/Nifty ratio chart has broken out of a consolidation range, suggesting continued relative outperformance in the medium term.

Stock market recommendations:Benchmark indices traded in a range with corrective bias on the Monthly expiry session on Thursday after surging nearly 9% over the preceding seven sessions, fueled by a mix of positive factors. Heavyweight stock buying, a weakening U.S. dollar, and declining crude oil prices boosted overall investor sentiment. The rally gained further traction with progress in trade talks with the U.S. and the extension of reciprocal tariff exemptions. Banking stocks were at the forefront of the gains as Bank Nifty rallied to a fresh all time high, lifted by easing of CPI data and an encouraging monsoon forecast—both of which reinforced expectations of a more aggressive rate-cutting cycle by the Reserve Bank of India.Nifty during the current week extended up move and formed a fresh high for CY25 at 24,359. The index closed the Thursday session at 24,246 levels.Index trends remain firmly positive, we expect the index to maintain a positive bias and head towards 24,550 being the 61.8% retracement of the entire decline (26277-21743) and then towards the December 2024 high of 24,850 in the upcoming weeks. Only a breach below Wednesday low (24120) will signal a pause in the current up trend.The daily stochastic is placed at an overbought territory after a sharp 1,900-point rally in the past 8 sessions. Hence, some consolidation at higher levels cannot be ruled out. A breach below Wednesday's low (24,120) can lead to some consolidation in the range of 24,350-23,800.We revise the support base higher towards 23,800 levels, being the Monday’s gap area and the recent breakout area. Index sustaining above the same will keep the short-term bias positive and dips should be viewed as buying opportunities. Stock specific action will continue to remain under focus as we progress through the Q4 earnings season.The stock has generated a breakout above a falling supply line joining highs of January and February 2025 signaling resumption of up move and offers fresh entry opportunity. The stock is also sustaining above the short- and long-term moving averagesWe expect the stock to maintain positive bias and head towards 162 levels in the medium term being the previous major high of January 2025.The share price of Electrosteel Castings has generated a breakout above the last 2 months range (108-88) signaling reversal of the corrective trend and also closed above the 50 days EMA.The daily 14 period RSI is in uptrend thus supports the positive bias. We expect the stock to head towards 128 levels in the medium term being measuring implication of the last 2 months range breakout (108-88).","According to Bajaj Broking Research, Lemon Treel Hotels and Electrosteel Castings are the top stock picks for today.

‘Adani co redirected QIP funds for smart meters to transmission’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/adani-co-redirected-qip-funds-for-smart-meters-to-transmission/articleshow/120602074.cms,"File Image

MUMBAI: Credit rating firm CARE has issued a monitoring agency report on Adani Transmission ’s Rs 8,873 crore raised via the QIP route in Aug 2024. According to the report, the company, now known as Adani Energy Solutions, deviated from the qualified institutional placement’s stated objectives. It diverted funds earmarked for smart meters to transmission systems — up to 10% of the money designated for installation of meters was redirected to transmission capex requirements.Though this deviation (up to 10%) is within the materiality threshold, it still requires formal disclosure and audit committee review, said a lawyer. Any deviation beyond 10% from the stated objects in the offer document may be considered material and might require shareholder approval, he added. The CARE report noted that Adani Energy spent about Rs 175 crore more than the planned expenditure in its transmission segment.“This amount (of Rs 175 crore) was utilised from the funds allocated towards the purchase and installation of smart meters,” read the report, disclosed by the company to the stock exchanges.In their comments, the company’s board of directors, chaired by Gautam Adani, said the over utilisation was necessary due to the growth in the transmission project capex outlay, which increased to Rs 60,000 crore by the end of fiscal 2025.In the QIP offer document, the company had outlined Rs 2,060 crore for expansion in transmission systems, Rs 1,800 crore for installing smart meters, Rs 2,420 crore for repaying borrowings, Rs 2,031 crore for general corporate purposes, and Rs 63 crore for issue-related expenses. By March 31, 2025, it utilised Rs 2,235 crore on transmission projects, Rs 916 crore on smart meter installations, and the balance on other stated purposes.Sebi rules require companies to strictly monitor and clearly disclose how funds raised through public issues are spent.","Adani Energy spent about Rs 175 crore more than the planned expenditure in its transmission segment.

Considers Incentives Like Lower Interest Rates, Registration Fees, Toll Waiver

NEW DELHI: The Centre is considering a slew of concessions, from upfront subsidies to interest rate concessions, toll waivers, and lower registration charges, as it seeks to promote electric trucks, especially on certain “priority routes”.Delhi-Chandigarh, Delhi-Jaipur, Mumbai-Nashik, Mumbai-Pune, and Agra-Lucknow are among the highway stretches that have been prioritised, keeping in mind that it takes five-to-six hours to travel on these stretches. The proposal being discussed is part of the PM e-Drive initiative , which has seen strong demand for electric two-and three-wheelers, with the allo cated subsidies for these segments expected to be exhausted in the next few months.The ministry of heavy industries, which is piloting the Rs 500 crore scheme for etrucks, has held consultations with several ministries as well as the steel, cement, ports, and logistics sectors to seek their feedback before drafting the final plan. Some of the “priority routes” will include the cement and steel corridors as well as movement within ports. Besides, it has studied the experience in Europe and China, which are the leading users of electric trucks.Strengthening of the power grid to deal with requirement is also among the issues that have been flagged by the power ministry, sources said. The subsidy for each vehicle will be linked to its size with an overall budgetary ceiling. The govt believes that incentives are required for truckers to move to EVs, as has also been the experience with two-wheelers and passenger vehicles.Separately, Tata Motors and Force Motors have indicated their interest in manufacturing electric ambulances , which are also part of the scheme. A govt official said there has been massive interest in the electric bus scheme as well, with Delhi, Bengaluru, Surat, Ahmedabad, and Hyderabad already submitting proposals for 15,400 buses against the funding available for 14,000 buses. Mumbai, Pune, Kolkata, and Chennai are yet to submit their proposals.The heavy industries ministry intends to issue tenders for supply of 10,000-11,000 buses to the five cities that have submitted their proposals, with the total subsidy capped at Rs 35 lakh per bus. The ministry is also working with other govt departments to put in place the charging infrastructure under the PM e-Drive scheme, .with the industry raising the issue of higher costs.","The Centre is considering a slew of concessions, from upfront subsidies to interest rate concessions, toll waivers, and lower registration charges.

HP looks to double down on PC production in India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/hp-looks-to-double-down-on-pc-production-in-india/articleshow/120602214.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: As India moves towards finalising a bilateral trade agreement with the US, American computer giant HP on Thursday said it will grow its manufacturing engagement in the country and will push for making more desktops and laptops.HP doubled its manufacturing output in the country last year, led by the Rs 17,000-crore production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme for making IT hardware and plans to grow the footprint of local production even further, India MD Ipsita Dasgupta said. “We are growing and are manufacturing through PLI with Dixon. So, we are growing our manufacturing in India. And every year over the next few years, you will see a proportional rise in the percentage of manufacturing here,” Dasgupta told TOI. The company leads the computer market in India and has now been going deeper into the country with new retail formats such as ‘HP Connect’— aimed at Tier 2and Tier 3 towns — that targets MSME clusters and household consumers.Dasgupta said production is being ramped up swiftly, especially as the ecosystem for manufacturing picks up. “Within our first year, we will double our manufacturing percentage in India. We’re making all-in-ones, desktops, and laptops.”Asked about the benefits of making in India, she said the PLI incentives are a significant enabler. “But more importantly, I think it’s exciting to be part of India’s desire to be a significant part of the global value chain . We have a large consumer base in India. So, as you make more in India, you also learn more about making in India. And that’s not something that we would want to be left out of.”She said the company believes that it will see more benefits of local manufacturing as the supplier ecosystem develops and becomes more cost-friendly. “You know, there’s still maths to be done on that, but it will get more cost-friendly. It’s getting there. And I actually think in the next two-three years, this will be something that the Indian ecosystem has surmounted.”","HP doubled its manufacturing output in the country last year, led by the Rs 17,000-crore production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme.

"Government open to some duty-free US auto imports like 1,600cc bikes",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/government-open-to-some-duty-free-us-auto-imports-like-1600cc-bikes/articleshow/120600620.cms,"NEW DELHI: Government is open to offering duty-free access to certain automobiles imported from the US, such as bikes with over 1,600cc engine capacity, if it can secure a favourable deal in some areas of interest. Some of the concessions, which are still being discussed internally, may, however, come with quotas. This means the lower or zero duty benefit may be available only for a certain number of units imported under the proposed bilateral trade agreement.The US has mounted immense pressure on India to lower tariffs on automobiles, whiskey and farm products, arguing that high import duties are holding up American exports. While India slashed the customs duty on products, such as high-end bikes and bourbon in Feb, the Donald Trump administration is not satisfied and is pushing for further cuts. Harley Davidson bikes and Tesla cars are on top of Trump’s priority list, especially with Elon Musk being a key aide of the American President.Musk has been lobbying with India to lower import duties, something that the government refused to do earlier.However, last year, it came up with a new policy that offered 15% tariffs for a limited period, provided companies using the window set up a manufacturing facility. The detailed guidelines are expected only in a few weeks as inter-ministerial consultations are currently underway. A steep tariff reduction will, however, impact investment plans.Faced with the threat of reciprocal tariffs, the commerce department, which is leading negotiations for a bilateral trade agreement, is holding consultations with other government departments and ministries. These, in turn, are seeking feedback from industry and other stakeholders. While sectoral negotiations are yet to commence, a team led by India’s chief negotiator, Rajesh Agrawal, is currently in Washington to iron out pending issues and explore the possibility of an “early tranche. ”Originally, Trump and PM Narendra Modi agreed to have a first tranche by autumn (Sept-Oct), covering import duty on goods, non-tariff barriers, and ways to strengthen the supply chain. India is hoping that in return for concessions offered by it, the Trump administration will not impose the 26% reciprocal tariffs, which have been paused for 90 days, while also lowering duties for labour-intensive products, such as textiles and leather goods shipped from the country.","The US has mounted immense pressure on India to lower tariffs on automobiles, whiskey and farm products.

Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway has amassed $300.87 billion in US Treasury bills, accounting for nearly 5% of the entire short-term government debt market.As of March 2025, the total US Treasury bill market stood at $6.15 trillion, which means Berkshire controls approximately 4.89% of it—equivalent to nearly one in every twenty dollars in circulation, according to an ET report.The move highlights Buffett's focus on safety and liquidity amid high stock valuations and ongoing global economic uncertainty. The report also noted that Berkshire’s T-bill holdings now exceed those of the US Federal Reserve, which owns just over $195 billion in similar securities.More than 90% of Berkshire’s $334 billion cash reserves are invested in short-term government debt. This includes $14.4 billion classified as cash equivalents with maturities under three months, and $286.47 billion listed as short-term Treasury investments.With average T-bill yields at 4.359% in April 2025, Buffett appears to be prioritizing stable returns over riskier investments. The billionaire investor has not made a major acquisition in over two years, often citing high valuations as the reason. “Everything’s too expensive,” he has said in past interviews.Other major companies like Apple have also increased their exposure to Treasuries.

Tariff worries continue hanging over companies as they report their latest financial results and try to provide guidance on their path ahead.Some tariffs remain in place against key U.S. trading partners, but others have been postponed to give nations time to negotiate. The tariff and trade picture continues shifting and that makes it difficult for companies and investors to make a reliable assessment of any impact to costs and sales.Seemingly few industries or companies are being spared from the uncertainty. Food and beverage businesses, pharmaceutical companies, and makers of household staples are among the many companies trying to gauge the potential impact to costs and sales.A new poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research shows that companies are right to be focused on tariffs. About 6 in 10 U.S. adults are ""extremely"" or ""very"" concerned about the cost of groceries in the next few months, while about half are highly concerned about the cost of big purchases, such as a car, cellphone or applianceHere's what companies are saying about tariffs and their potential impact:Procter & Gamble, the maker of such products as Crest toothpaste, Tide detergent and Charmin toilet paper, said Thursday said it's doing whatever it can to reduce higher costs from President Donald Trump's expansive tariffs from shifting sourcing to changing formulation to avoid duties.But P&G's Chief Financial Officer Andre Schulten told reporters on a call that the consumer products giant still will likely have to pass on higher prices to shoppers as early as July.The consumer product giant reduced its annual financial outlook after reporting lower sales, particularly in the U.S. and Western Europe, during the latest quarter, due to a pullback in consumer spending over worries about tariffs as well as overall financial worries about job security and mortgage rates.""Everything plays into the consumer behavior,"" Schulten said. ""Uncertainty around the stock market and what their 401ks are worth and what the portfolio is worth. Uncertainty around the economic outlook and what it means for their livelihood and the job market.""PepsiCo lowered its full-year earnings expectations, citing increased costs from tariffs and a pullback in consumer spending.The maker of Pepsi beverages and Frito-Lay snacks said it now expects its core earnings per share to be even with last year. Previously it expected mid-single-digit percentage growth.A 25% tariff on imported aluminum is among those hitting PepsiCo and other beverage makers. The company expects ""elevated levels of volatility and uncertainty"" for the rest of this year.Merck trimmed its earnings forecast for the year, though it maintained its guidance for revenue.The pharmaceutical giant has a global reach. Half of its revenue comes from the U.S. market, with the rest of the world making up the other half, according to FactSet. The company expects tariffs already implemented to cost the company about $200 million.American Airlines American Airlines withdrew its earnings forecast for the year amid uncertainty over the economy.While tariffs might not directly impact airlines and other companies in the travel sector, they could prompt a shift in consumer spending. Tariffs typically make goods more expensive and that might force consumers to tighten their budgets and focus more on necessities, while cutting back on discretionary items and services, such as travel.","Some tariffs remain in place against key U.S. trading partners, but others have been postponed.

Wall Street rallies on strong corporate earnings despite lingering trade war jitters,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-stock-markets-dow-jones-industrial-index-nasdaq-sp-500-us-china-trade-deal-hopes-stay-murky/articleshow/120587807.cms,"US stocks rallied Thursday as a wave of better-than-expected corporate earnings lifted investor sentiment, though concerns about ongoing trade tensions and economic uncertainty continue to loom over Wall Street.According to the Associated Press, the S&P 500 climbed 1.9% in late trading, narrowing the gap to within 11% of its all-time high set earlier this year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 450 points, or 1.1%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite surged 2.5%, as strong performance from major tech and industrial companies buoyed markets.A standout contributor to the rally was ServiceNow, which saw its stock jump 15.8% after reporting first-quarter profits for 2025 that exceeded analyst expectations. The AI-powered enterprise software company also issued an upbeat forecast for subscription revenue, further boosting investor confidence.Southwest Airlines also delivered stronger-than-anticipated earnings, despite uncertainty clouding the broader economic outlook. CEO Bob Jordan emphasized the company is ""controlling what we can control,"" announcing plans to reduce flight schedules in the second half of the year.Southwest’s stock fluctuated through the day before ending up 3.2%.Rival American Airlines joined in pulling its full-year guidance due to economic unpredictability but saw its stock rise 3.3% after beating quarterly profit estimates. Many companies, spanning various industries, echoed similar concerns about issuing financial forecasts amid the volatile climate created by Trump’s trade policies.The trade war, sparked by the on-again-off-again imposition of tariffs by President Donald Trump , has left businesses and investors grappling with shifting headlines and economic consequences. Optimism over a softening stance on tariffs had lifted markets earlier in the week, but that was shaken Thursday when China denied being in active negotiations with the US, likening reports of progress to “trying to catch the wind.”Tan Jing Yi of Mizuho Bank’s Asia & Oceania Treasury Department described Trump’s trade strategy as “headline turbulence,” warning of long-term harm to global economies and adding that sentiment continues to swing wildly “from hopes of intense relief to inflicted economic gloom.”The market’s week has been marked by extreme swings—beginning with sharp losses on trade fears and now rebounding on strong earnings—reflecting the lack of clarity around future economic policies. “It’s an unhealthy market backdrop right now, and we’re trying not to react too much,” said John Belton, a portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds.Despite the broader uncertainty, several companies delivered standout earnings results. Toymaker Hasbro saw its shares soar 15.6% after reporting stronger-than-expected profit and revenue, citing continued growth of its Magic: The Gathering card game. Semiconductor giant Texas Instruments also impressed, rallying 6.2% on better-than-forecast earnings.However, not all earnings news was positive. Consumer goods titan Procter & Gamble fell 3.6% even after beating profit expectations. The company’s revenue came in below forecasts, and it trimmed its full-year profit outlook, citing a $200 million earnings hit from higher commodity costs.PepsiCo similarly warned of challenges ahead. CEO Ramon Laguarta highlighted “more volatility and uncertainty,” with subdued consumer demand and higher costs due to tariffs—including a 25% import tariff on aluminum cans—contributing to a 5% drop in the company’s shares after it lowered its profit forecast for 2025.In the bond market, Treasury yields eased, with the 10-year yield falling to 4.30% from 4.40% the previous day. The decline followed a report showing that slightly more Americans filed for unemployment benefits last week than anticipated. Additionally, March saw a sharper-than-expected drop in sales of previously owned homes, further signaling potential economic softening.Overseas, stock markets in Europe and Asia saw modest and mixed movements, reflecting the global ripple effects of trade policy uncertainties and economic concerns.While the earnings season has provided a temporary lift, market watchers agree that volatility is likely to persist until clearer signals emerge about the direction of US trade and fiscal policy. For now, Wall Street appears to be navigating a delicate balance between strong current performance and an unpredictable future.","US stocks rallied Thursday as a wave of better-than-expected corporate earnings lifted investor sentiment.

Unsettled tariff policies and unpredictable trade war is weighing down companies as they try to provide investors with any financial outlooks in the latest financial results.While some tariffs on key US trading partners remain, others have been temporarily postponed to allow room for negotiations. However, the constantly shifting policies often changing by the day, have left businesses struggling to assess the impact on their costs and revenues.On Tuesday, US treasury secretary Scott Bessent struck a cautiously optimistic note, saying he expected a “de-escalation” in the trade war with China . However, he also acknowledged that formal negotiations are yet to begin.Here’s how some of the biggest companies are handling the uncertainty:Chipotle Mexican Grill on Wednesday said that the costs are increasing due to the tariffs. The chain sources beef from Australia, avocados from Colombia and Peru and packaging from Vietnam, Indonesia and Thailand. All the materials are now subjected to a 10% tariff.CFO Adam Rymer warned that tariffs could also drive up the cost of building new restaurants, as its Chinese-sourced equipment and materials would be affected, though the situation with China is still unpredictable.The food giant reported lower-than-expected revenue for the first quarter and cut its full-year forecast for same-store sales.CEO Scott Boatwright blamed economic anxiety, saying it was the “overwhelming reason” for a decline in customer visits, an issue that has persisted into April.Tesla appears better positioned than many automakers, thanks to its largely domestic production. However, its energy division could take a hit due to reliance on LFP battery cells from China.The EV manufacturer could also face a major setback, as China being the world's largest electric market has also retaliated against the US.Earlier this month, Tesla suspended orders for its Model S and X in mainland China, another blow amid potential retaliation from Beijing, the world’s largest EV market.CEO Elon Musk, a close ally of President Trump, said he still supported “lower tariffs,” calling them a route to prosperity, but acknowledged that trade decisions ultimately lie with the president.Dutch multinational Akzo Nobel said its exposure to US tariffs is limited thanks to years of strategic localisation. CEO Gregoire Poux-Guillaume told analysts, “Over the years, we deliberately localized both our procurement and production in the US.”“We also largely run China for China and use the rest of Asia instead as an export base.”The company deals in a range of products, from paints and coatings for the automotive industry to the diy homeowners. However, major tariffs could still hurt businesses and sales.Medical device maker Boston Scientific expects most of the tariff pain to hit later this year, estimating a $200 million impact in 2025. Still, the company raised its earnings and revenue outlook, confident it can absorb the costs through stronger sales and belt-tightening.With a long-established global supply chain and significant US investment, Boston Scientific said that it was prepared to ride out the storm.Aircraft giant Boeing said most of its supply chain is US-based and that many imports from Canada and Mexico are protected under current trade agreements. Tariffs on other suppliers, including Japan and Italy, are expected to be recoverable, with a net cost of less than $500 million annually.Yet the aeroplane manufacturer is more concerned about retaliation from key markets, especially China, which has already halted deliveries of its aircraft.Telecoms giant AT&T said it is bracing for potential increases in the cost of mobile phones and network equipment. However, it believes that it can manage the fallout for now, based on the current pause in tariffs and supply chain.“The magnitude of any increase will depend on a variety of factors, including how much of the tariffs the vendors pass on, the impact that the tariffs have on consumer and business demand,” said CEO John Stankey.",Chipotle Mexican Grill said that the costs are increasing due to the tariffs.

At present, they are subjected to a 10 per cent tariff under the existing trade policy introduced during the Trump administration.“India also has fewer non-tariff trade barriers, obviously, no currency manipulation, very, very little government subsidies, so that reaching a deal with the Indians is much easier,” Bessant said, quoted by the New York Post.The comments were made on the sidelines of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund’s annual meetings in Washington DC, where trade tensions and global economic shifts have been key topics.President Trump has made it clear that he wants foreign governments to slash their tariff and non-tariff restrictions on American goods and help reduce the US trade deficit. India, the world’s most populous country, could be the first to secure a trade pact that meets those terms.The push for a deal comes as US Vice President JD Vance visited Jaipur on Tuesday, urging India to remove remaining non-tariff barriers, open its markets further, and step up imports of American energy and defence equipment. He called for stronger economic ties as part of a vision for a “prosperous and peaceful” 21st century between the two democracies.Trade figures reflect the growing importance of the relationship. The New York Post cited US census bureau data showing that India made up nearly 3 per cent of US imports as of February. In 2024, the US trade deficit with India stood at $45.7 billion, according to the office of the US trade representative.","US treasury secretary Scott Bessent says talks with India are close to a breakthrough.

The electric carmaker has seen its profits plunge by 71 percent in the first quarter of 2025, driven largely by a backlash against Musk’s political affiliations and controversial role in President Donald Trump’s administration.Sales of Tesla vehicles across Europe have dropped sharply, with a 45 percent decline in the EU and a staggering 62 percent fall in Germany alone, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association (ACEA). Showrooms in Europe and the US have become targets for vandalism and boycott campaigns following Musk’s support for public sector cuts and far-right figures overseas. In Milan, protesters hung Musk in effigy, while in Berlin and London, demonstrators labelled Tesla vehicles as “Swasticars. ”Also read: 'Will spend less time at DOGE from May': Elon Musk to focus on Tesla as its profits plunge 71%

Despite these setbacks, Musk appears intent on shifting focus back to Tesla. During Tuesday’s earnings call, he announced plans to reduce his time working for the “Department of Government Efficiency” – a post he holds in Trump’s administration – to just one or two days per week starting in May. Tesla’s shares rose nearly five percent following the announcement.Musk rejected claims that political controversies were damaging the brand, instead blaming recent sales drops on production halts caused by upgrades to the Model Y.Analysts, however, are not convinced. JP Morgan described the situation as one of “unprecedented brand damage,” while Wedbush’s Dan Ives, a longstanding supporter of Tesla, called it a “full-blown crisis.”Also read: Tesla feels the heat: Elon Musk’s DOGE politics hits Tesla profits

Compounding Tesla’s woes is the rise of aggressive competition, particularly from Chinese automaker BYD, which is developing ultra-fast charging batteries. European manufacturers are also rolling out new models with advanced technology, further eating into Tesla’s market share. In the US, Tesla’s dominance has slipped, with its EV market share falling below 50 percent.Meanwhile, Tesla continues to pin its hopes on autonomous driving. Musk reaffirmed that its Robotaxi service would launch in Austin by June, despite Google’s Waymo already offering millions of driverless trips in several American cities. Musk insists that software updates will soon allow current Teslas to operate autonomously, although such promises have been made – and missed – before.Tesla’s valuation remains lofty, trading at over 100 times its projected earnings, making the company highly vulnerable to further setbacks.","Sales of Tesla vehicles across Europe have dropped sharply, with a 45 percent decline in the EU and a staggering 62 percent fall in Germany.

Are the best days over for US stock markets?

""The US has made an all-time peak,"" he said, likening it to the Japanese market in 1989.

China’s battery powerhouse CATL has unveiled a new generation of electric vehicle technology that could threaten Tesla ’s global dominance. The company, which already supplies batteries to Tesla’s Shanghai factory, said its upgraded Shenxing battery offers longer range, quicker charging, and better performance in cold weather, a leap that could bring electric vehicles closer to matching petrol cars on both price and practicality, as per theAnnounced at CATL’s Tech Day in Shanghai, the new Shenxing battery boasts a 320-mile range and can deliver 200 miles of charge in just five minutes. By contrast, Tesla’s Superchargers require 15 minutes to deliver the same mileage. “Once again, we are pushing the boundaries of performance beyond limits,” said CATL’s chief technology officer Gao Huan, who added that the goal is for the Shenxing battery to become the standard in EVs.The company also introduced a new sodium-ion battery, branded Naxtra, which CATL says is a safer and more affordable alternative to lithium-based batteries. While these innovations are still a couple of years away from being widely available in production vehicles, CATL’s announcement follows closely on the heels of a similar tech breakthrough by rival BYD , underlining the fierce innovation race within China’s EV industry.CATL, short for Contemporary Amperex Technology Company Ltd., currently produces around a third of the world’s EV batteries and works with 16 of the top global carmakers. BYD, its main Chinese competitor, narrowly edged out Tesla in battery-powered EV production in 2024. It sold 1,777,965 units compared to Tesla’s 1,773,443, aided by its dominance in plug-in hybrid sales and a rapid expansion of its ultra-fast charging infrastructure across China.Other major Chinese automakers like Great Wall, Geely, and Chery are also aggressively pushing into international markets, banking on innovation and affordability to win over buyers. Geely owns stakes in Volvo, Lotus, and Aston Martin, while Chery has sold more than 15 million vehicles overseas.

'Made in South Korea': How Chinese companies are allegedly 'evading' Trump tariffs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/made-in-south-korea-how-chinese-companies-are-allegedly-evading-trump-tariffs/articleshow/120571098.cms,"Chinese companies are allegedly evading steep US tariffs by fraudulently exporting goods as South Korean products, Japanese news outlet Nikkei Asia news reported.According to Korea Customs Service, exports falsely labeled as made in South Korea amounted to 29.5 billion won for the January-March quarter. In this, the goods exported to the US accounted for 97 per cent.""The total for all of last year was 34.8 billion won"", it said. Fraud uncovered so far in 2025 has already reached 85% of the full-year total for 2024.According to the report, in some instances, prices of goods have also been deliberately under declared to lower tariff costs.South Korea’s customs service highlighted a number of such schemes, including the case of Chinese-made mattresses—which are subject to anti-dumping duties in the US—being routed through South Korea.These mattresses were stored in warehouses operated by a company registered under a Chinese national's name in South Korea, and then exported to the US falsely labeled as South Korean products.In another example, anode materials used in rechargeable batteries were shipped from China, repackaged in South Korea, and falsely labeled before being exported.Similarly, parts for surveillance cameras were imported into South Korea, assembled domestically, and then exported under the guise of being South Korean-made.South Korea’s customs agency has now established a special task force to investigate and crack down on these deceptive trade practices. Authorities warned that such tactics could undermine South Korea’s trade credibility and harm domestic industries that abide by international regulations.The crackdown comes as South Korea enters a new round of trade talks with the United States this week. Analysts suggest the timing may be strategic, aimed at demonstrating Seoul’s commitment to curbing indirect exports of Chinese goods, a key concern for the Trump administration.Earlier, the Wall Street Journal reported that US officials are expected to press their South Korean counterparts during negotiations to prevent such circumvention of tariffs. In response, China’s ministry of commerce said that it would reject any trade deal that compromises Chinese interests and vowed to take reciprocal countermeasures if needed.US President Donald Trump's administration has slapped goods from China with tariffs that have soared to 145%. Although South Korean goods have also been hit with ""reciprocal"" tariffs currently on a 90-day pause, their tariff rate of 10% for now is far more favorable.",Chinese companies are allegedly evading steep US tariffs by fraudulently exporting goods as South Korean products.

The shift offered investors much-needed relief, with market sentiment buoyed by Trump’s decision not to remove Fed Chair Jerome Powell and speculation that trade tariffs on Chinese goods could be reduced.The greenback had been under pressure, lingering near three-year lows amid uncertainty over Trump’s tariff policies and repeated criticism of the Federal Reserve. However, comments from both Trump and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent suggested a possible thaw in US-China relations and signalled a willingness to engage in deeper economic collaboration.Trump, speaking from the Oval Office, said: “I have no intention of firing him,” referring to Powell. “I would like to see him be a little more active in terms of his idea to lower interest rates.” The remark came after days of speculation over the Fed's independence, which had rattled investors and triggered volatility in global markets.The dollar index rose 0.297% to 99.86 in early Asian trading, before stabilising as cautious optimism returned. The euro slipped 0.86% to $1.132, reversing gains made earlier in the week.Helen Given of Monex USA said the renewed dialogue with China was a key factor: “People are very relieved that there's potential for discussions between the two countries.”Bessent reinforced that message in Washington, suggesting any easing of tariffs would not be unilateral and would depend on progress in talks with Beijing. He also voiced strong criticism of the IMF and World Bank but affirmed US support for their roles, distancing the Trump administration from earlier proposals advocating a US withdrawal.Meanwhile, Trump hinted at further tariffs if no deals were made. “If we don’t have a deal... we’re going to set the tariff,” he said. He also suggested auto tariffs on Canada could increase, despite existing exemptions under the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement.The markets responded positively.

Different paths

Donald Trump's tariff plans have increased the risks to public finances, the International Monetary Fund said Wednesday, warning countries to get their spending plans under control and prepare for ""sharper"" trade-offs.The US president's on-again, off-again introduction of levies against top trading partners has sent market volatility soaring and unnerved investors, who are attempting to chart a path through the increased uncertainty.Over the past six months, ""global economic prospects have significantly deteriorated, and risks to the economic output are elevated and tilted to the downside"" Vitor Gaspar, the head of the IMF's Fiscal Affairs department, told reporters on Wednesday at the launch of the Fund's Fiscal Monitor report.The forecast for public finances was published as part of the Fund and the World Bank's Spring Meetings of global financial leaders currently under way in Washington.Under its new projections, which incorporate some -- but not all -- of the recently announced tariffs, the IMF now expects global general government debt to rise to more than 95 percent of economic output this year, and to approach 100 percent of GDP by 2030.In the forecasts, the IMF expects public debt to rise by about the same amount as the combined increases seen in 2023 and 2024, Gaspar told AFP in an interview ahead of the report's publication.""There is a pronounced trend in public debt around the world,"" he said.The IMF warned in its report that the ""heightened uncertainty"" about tariffs and economic policy, combined with rising bond yields in major economies, widening spreads in emerging markets, foreign aid cuts, and increased defense spending in Europe had all complicated the global debt outlook.""Fiscal policy now faces a sharper trade-off between reducing debt, building buffers against uncertainties and accommodating spending pressures, all amidst weaker growth prospects, higher financing costs, and heightened risks,"" it added.While public spending levels may pose political challenges, the right policy can also ""be a source of confidence and support in potentially very demanding macroeconomic circumstances,"" Gaspar told AFP.""Communities may be severely affected by trade dislocations, and targeted and temporary support... could be a way forward,"" he added.The IMF expects that more than a third of the world's economies, who collectively account for 75 percent of global GDP, will see a rise in indebtedness this year.This includes many of the world's largest economies, including the United States, China, Germany, Britain, and France.But these countries will face very different realities when it comes to handling that debt, Gaspar said in the interview.""Both China and the United States are continental economies,"" he said. ""They have a space that other economies don't have.""""The United States has an ample set of options, both on the revenue side and on the spending side, that it can deploy to control the deficit, stabilize the level of public debt and decrease the level of public debt, if it chooses to do so,"" he added.""How it's going to happen depends on... the choices made in the context of the US political system,"" he said.For China, Gaspar noted that the authorities would ""eventually"" need to tackle its public debt, but should focus their attention at this moment in time on providing targeted support to transform the economy.""Fiscal support in China is welcome right now,"" he said. ""It is something that helps rebalancing China growth towards the domestic economy.""""By doing so, it helps reduce the external imbalance.""","IMF warns of ""sharper"" trade-off between reducing debt, building buffers against uncertainties.

Boeing on Wednesday said that China has ""stopped taking delivery"" of its aircraft, as tensions between Washington and Beijing over tariffs continue to disrupt the global aviation market.The company will now begin marketing the planes to other airlines after Chinese carriers returned the planes, Aerospace giant CEO Kelly Ortberg said in an interview with CNBC.Boeing would be “pretty pragmatic” in finding alternative buyers for the aircrafts, he added.The remarks came after reports of multiple Boeing 737 MAX jets , originally bound for Chinese airlines, were flown back to the United States. One such aircraft, destined for Xiamen Airlines, made an unplanned return to Boeing Field in Seattle on Sunday.The shift came after US President Donald Trump raised tariffs on Chinese imports to 145% earlier this month to which the latter retaliated with its own 125% tariffs on US-made goods, including aircrafts. The decision rendered Boeing’s bestselling 737 MAX, with a market value of around $55 million, far less affordable for Chinese airlines.The financial pressure reportedly pushed Beijing to consider measures to help its domestic carriers, especially those leasing Boeing jets.The company reported a narrower-than-expected loss of $123 million for the first quarter, with revenues rising 18% to $19.5 billion.In an earnings statement, Ortberg said the numbers show the company is “moving in the right direction.”Boeing also reaffirmed plans to boost aircraft production, stating it will raise monthly output of the 737 MAX to 38 by 2025, and increase 787 Dreamliner production from five to seven per month.","Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg says China has ""stopped taking delivery"" of its aircraft.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume.

Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran Udaan until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.Udaan built an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business still accounts for a very small part of India’s overall retail market but can balloon to $150 billion in sales and yield a 100% return on capital invested in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co. estimates published in the Mint newspaper.Bengaluru-based Udaan has also ventured into financing through its fintech unit which helps shopkeepers get working capital loans to buy inventory. That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says.

Space sector start-up Sisir Radar to develop SAR on L/P band SAR,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/space-sector-start-up-sisir-radar-to-develop-sar-on-l/p-band-sar/articleshow/104558111.cms,"CHENNAI: Space sector startup, Sisir Radar Private Ltd has hit success at the prestigious iDEX DefSpace Challenge with its projects for development of “L/P band Continuous Wave SAR (synthetic aperture radar) payload for LEO Small Satellites” and “Unfurlable, Electronically Steering Antenna for L/P band SAR payload” for Indian Air Force (IAF), said a top company official.The company is promoted by former Director at the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) Tapan Misra and the brains behind the Indian space agency’s RISAT series of SAR satellites as well as the Dual Frequency SAR on the Chandrayaan 2 orbiter that is currently circling the moon.""A grant of Rs 3 crore is also there for development of the products,"" Misra told IANS.Synthetic Aperture Radar or SAR is a special kind of imaging radar technology that can provide extremely accurate high resolution imagery of the terrain through clouds, smoke and dust even in pitch dark conditions. SAR imagery provides much higher resolution than other forms of remote sensing technology such as hyperspectral and multispectral. SAR is a critical technology for strategic reconnaissance and planning as well as for disaster management.According to Misra, winning the challenge in just over a year of floating the company is a major booster.He said L and P band SAR have an advantage over other frequencies (like X band) when it comes to penetration capabilities through rain, clouds, foliage and vegetation in a tropical country like India, and underground penetration capabilities in dry terrain.Continuing further, he said the L band SAR will provide 1 metre resolution, spotlight resolution in Stripmap mode. The current industry standard is 5-10 metre in L band. Misra said both the L and P band will operate simultaneously from a satellite borne SAR. Recently, Sisir Radar successfully developed and tested the world’s highest resolution L-Band SAR fitted on a drone. With 0.2 metre resolution, this is by far the highest L band SAR in the world, he said.","Space sector startup, Sisir Radar Private Ltd has hit success at the prestigious iDEX DefSpace Challenge.

Testify: Sam Bankman-Fried acknowledges 'mistakes' but testifies he did not defraud anyone,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/cryptocurrency/sam-bankman-fried-acknowledges-mistakes-but-testifies-he-did-not-defraud-anyone/articleshow/104761929.cms,"<p>Sam Bankman-Fried (File Photo- Reuters)<br></p>

NEW YORK: Sam Bankman-Fried , testifying in his own defense at his fraud trial on Friday, acknowledged that a ""lot of people got hurt"" when the FTX cryptocurrency exchange he founded collapsed, but said he did not defraud anyone or take customer funds.Shortly after taking the witness stand in Manhattan federal court, Bankman-Fried said he made ""a number of small mistakes and a number of larger mistakes"" while running the now-bankrupt exchange. The biggest mistake, he said, was not implementing a dedicated risk management team.""We thought that we might be able to build the best product on the market,"" Bankman-Fried said. ""It turned out basically the opposite of that. A lot of people got hurt - customers, employees - and the company ended up in bankruptcy.""Prosecutors accuse Bankman-Fried of using FTX customer funds to prop up his crypto-focused hedge fund, Alameda Research, make speculative venture investments and donate more than $100 million to US political campaigns. He also faces charges of scheming to cheat Alameda's lenders and FTX investors.He has pleaded not guiltyBankman-Fried's trial, which began on October 3, is drawing to a close nearly a year after FTX collapsed amid a wave of customer withdrawals. The company declared bankruptcy in November 2022 and Bankman-Fried was indicted the following month.His testimony marked the first time the dozen jurors and five alternates have heard directly from the 31-year-old former billionaire after 12 trial days.Bankman-Fried, who was jailed in August after US District Judge Lewis Kaplan found he likely tampered with witnesses, wore a suit and spoke with two water bottles placed in front of him on the witness stand. The former mogul once known for wearing shorts and T-shirts and sporting an unkempt mop of curly locks cut his hair before his trial began.Responding to questions posed by his defense lawyer Mark Cohen, Bankman-Fried spoke in calm, measured tones during the first portion of his testimony as he recounted founding Alameda in 2017, shortly after graduating from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, despite knowing little about crypto.But Bankman-Fried - who had studied physics and worked as a quantitative trader at Jane Street - said he saw opportunities for ""arbitrage"" in the market for digital assets. He said Alameda's first office was in a small Airbnb in Berkeley, California, before he later moved the firm to Hong Kong.""We wanted to be under the radar at that point in time,"" he said on the stand, adding he named the hedge fund after the California county where it was founded in part so competitors would not discover what they were doing.Jurors have heard from three of his closest confidantes at FTX and Alameda, all of whom have pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors. They testified earlier this month that they committed financial crimes at Bankman-Fried's behest.For criminal defendants, taking the stand is a risky proposition because it opens them up to potentially probing cross-examination by prosecutors.But given Bankman-Fried's penchant for risk, legal experts say he likely viewed taking the stand as his best shot to counter the allegations made by members of his inner circle, which were backed up by spreadsheets the three said demonstrated how customer funds were stolen and text messages in which they discussed FTX's shortfall of funds with Bankman-Fried.","Sam Bankman-Fried says he made ""a number of small mistakes and a number of larger mistakes"" while running the now-bankrupt exchange.

Big Hint By Ruling Party MP & Ex-Diplomat Amid Tariff Escalation

NEW DELHI: The finance ministry on Wednesday cautioned that while the immediate impact of US tariffs on Indian exports may be limited, their secondary and long-term effects could pose significant challenges.The remarks come as Washington’s 50% duties on Indian goods took effect from August 27, covering exports worth over $48 billion.The ministry’s monthly economic review stressed that ongoing India-US trade negotiations will be crucial in mitigating the fallout.""While the immediate impact of recent US tariffs on Indian exports may appear limited, their secondary and tertiary effects on the economy pose challenges that must be addressed. In this context, the ongoing India-US trade negotiations will be crucial,"" it said.Key sectors facing the brunt include textiles, gems and jewellery, shrimp, leather, chemicals, and machinery, though pharmaceuticals and energy products remain unaffected.India is simultaneously pushing for diversified trade partnerships, with recent FTAs signed with the UK and EFTA, and negotiations under way with the US, EU, New Zealand, Chile, and Peru.However, the report noted that these initiatives will take time and may not fully offset export losses if tariffs remain.""This includes the recently concluded FTA with the UK and EFTA and ongoing FTA negotiations with the US, EU, New Zealand, Chile, and Peru. But, these initiatives will take time to show results and may not fully address the shortfall in exports to the US that may arise if the current tariff rates on India persist,"" it said.The review also highlighted India’s upgraded sovereign rating by S&P from 'BBB-' to 'BBB', reflecting strong growth, stable policies, and high infrastructure investment. Domestically, better monsoon rains and improved crop prospects are expected to keep inflation moderate in the near term.""An increased market arrival in Q1, comfortable buffer stocks and better output prospects, coupled with stable global oil markets, might keep the prices of food grain moderate. The downside risks to global growth are likely to keep international commodity prices in check, partly offsetting the impact of higher tariffs,"" it noted.To further enhance the economic growth Prime Minister has announced a few initiatives focusing on policy reforms.The government announced a Task Force for Next-Generation Reforms, a planned rollout of GST changes to ease the tax burden, and schemes like PM Viksit Bharat Rozgar Yojana to boost jobs and skill development.Together, these measures aim to strengthen growth, attract investment, and sustain economic resilience amid global uncertainties.","The finance ministry cautioned that while the immediate impact of US tariffs on Indian exports may be limited, their secondary and long-term effects could pose significant challenges.

Top stock market recommendations: According to Aakash K Hindocha, Deputy Vice President - WM Research, Nuvama Professional Clients Group, Nykaa, Kaynes, and Dr Reddy's Laboratories are the top buy calls for today. Here’s his view on Nifty, Bank Nifty and the top stock picks for August 28, 2025:After an inside bar formation on Monday, Nifty opened with a gap down reeling all throughout the session ahead of its trading holiday on Wednesday. The index has closed below its trailing support of 24800 allowing for further downside to be opened for 24500 / 24350. Nifty has also formed a bearish head and shoulders formation on daily charts with a neck line support seen at 24450. A break below the same post monthly expiry could reel in further pressure on the index.Underperforming Nifty, Bank has broken its support of 55050 opening for a test of sub 54000 odd levels to begin with. The index has also closed at a 3.5 month low on daily charts ahead of its monthly expiry scheduled on Thursday. 55000 is likely to act as resistance on the upside while the index slides below sub 54000 levels in the coming week.Stock has been gaining traction ever since its 3 year triangle breakout seen in June 2025. For now NYKAA has given the highest ever close in past 3 years of trading along with a huge cup and handle breakout on daily and weekly charts. This opens up for a 18-20% trading buy target on the stock, yet we would advise for an initial uptick being 250+ on this leg.After a cup and handle breakout in early August 2025, stock has been consolidating near the breakout zone for the past 4 weeks now. Last week’s price action suggests further move northwards from CMP as the stock has completed multiple retests of its ongoing breakout.Sustaining above its 200 DMA support, DRREDDY’s has also given a bullish flag breakout on daily charts. This allows its initial upside to open for the 1350-1360 zone where it could meet another potential breakout on upside.","Aakash K Hindocha, Deputy Vice President - WM Research, Nuvama Professional Clients Group, Nykaa, Kaynes, and Dr Reddy's Laboratories are the top buy calls for today.

Indian Economy Under Attack From Trump? Exports May Crash By Nearly 50%, Key Sectors To Suffer

India firm on its red lines on US trade deal

India's top 10 exports to US face high tariffs

India-US trade deal negotiations are contingent on how each country deals with ‘red lines’ sources have said. The US has imposed 50% tariffs on India for its exports to America, effective today. The high tariffs - 25% ‘reciprocal’ + 25% for India’s crude oil trade with Russia - come as stalemate on the trade deal continues.According to a PTI report quoting sources, the progress of India-US trade pact discussions will be determined by how both nations address their respective concerns and limitations.Bilateral trade agreement (BTA) discussions between India and the US commenced in March. After completing five rounds of negotiations, the scheduled sixth round, where the US delegation was due to visit India from August 25, has been postponed.Also Read | ‘Country first, commerce later’: Indian refiners unlikely to stop Russia crude oil trade under US pressure; ‘message from government is…’ India has explicitly stated its position regarding the protection of farmers, fishermen and small-scale industries, with no room for compromise on these matters.Prime Minister Narendra Modi has expressed his firm commitment to safeguard the interests of farmers and fishermen, emphasising that India will remain steadfast in protecting their welfare.""Ultimately there are some red lines that we cannot overlook, the deal is dependent upon how each party addresses those red lines.For us it has been clearly spelt out,"" the source told PTI.Under the suggested BTA, the United States aims to secure lower tariffs for agricultural products including corn, soybeans, apples, almonds and ethanol, whilst seeking enhanced market access for its dairy sector. However, India stands firm in opposing these requests, citing concerns over the welfare of its small-scale farming community.India has maintained its position of not offering tariff concessions in trade agreements, as evidenced by its previous arrangements with nations like Australia and Switzerland.Also Read | India not bowing to Trump’s pressure! As 50% US tariffs kick in, here’s how government aims to counter impact - from GST cuts to next-gen reforms The agreement aspires to elevate bilateral trade to $500 billion by 2030, a significant increase from the present $191 billion.Both nations have set their sights on finalising the initial phase of the BTA by fall (September-October) of 2025.The trade figures for 2024-25 show bilateral exchanges between India and the US reached $131.8 billion, comprising $86.5 billion in exports and $45.3 billion in imports.During April-July of 2025-26, the US emerged as India's principal trading partner, with bilateral trade valued at $12.56 billion.","The US has imposed 50% tariffs on India for its exports to America, effective today.

Varanasi: With the American market accounting for almost 60% of India's carpet exports of Rs 16,000 crore, amounting to nearly Rs 9,600 crore, the tariff hike is making the industry sweat, reports Rajeev Dikshit.

$80-billion automobile components industry looks for path to steer around Trump wall,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/80-billion-automobile-components-industry-looks-for-path-to-steer-around-trump-wall/articleshow/123553545.cms,".

Gurgaon: Manesar, one of the three main engines alongside Chennai and Pune of India's massive automobile sector, is bracing for impact as the 50% tariff regime comes into effect. But unlike garment exporters, the auto ancillary industry does not have to contend with a blanket 50% tariff, giving it some wiggle room.Jagdeep Rangar of Stork Rubber Product, which makes engine mounts, rubber bushes, high voltage polymer insulators, etc, said auto component exports to the US can be categorised into two parts - supplies to light trucks and passenger vehicles, which have a 27.5% tariff and will continue to be so, and components for marine, agriculture (like tractors), heavy trucks, heavy machines and cranes that face a 50% tariff. Though it's the latter that will take the bigger hit, sources said the impact will be felt across ancillaries because the same companies often manufacture parts in both categories.""We are hoping to get some relief from govt, otherwise we will not be able to absorb the kind of discounts being demanded by buyers,"" said Rangar, adding finding new markets is not easy as developing a new product is a long process with a lead time of around two years.""Auto components are not developed overnight. We have to invest in tooling, send samples for testing. There are many more steps before the product is fit for the market,"" said Rangar, describing the current situation as ""a flux"".Vinnie Mehta, director-general of Automotive Component Manufacturers Association of India(ACMA), said auto components exports to the US in 2024 stood at $6.6 billion. ""Of this, $3.5 billion worth of export will continue to be at 25%. This covers parts and components for cars and small trucks covered under US Proclamation 10908 dated March 26, 2025. This is about 55% of our export to the US. The remaining will attract a 50% tariff. ""India's automotive component industry is worth around $80 bn, out of which $23 bn is exports and the US share is around 8-9%, added Mehta. ""It is too early to comment on the gravity of the impact. EU is also a $7-billion market.""Nitin G R, founder of auto accessories maker GrandPitstop, said the company is trying to find ways to overcome the shock. ""We are exploring ways to reach the US market with a lower tariff burden. Re-routing shipments through third countries is an option under consideration."" An industry insider said many companies have already started work on diversifying their client base in other countries. ""Indian companies are looking to expand in the Middle East, Africa and Latin America. "" Shradha Suri Marwah, president of ACMA, said: ""While this development presents near-term headwinds, it also underscores the importance of enhancing competitiveness, strengthening value addition, and exploring new markets.""","India's automotive component industry is worth around $80 bn.

Bernstein initiated its coverage of Titan with an outperform rating and a target price of Rs 4,200. Analysts said Titan is best placed to capture increasing formalization and contemporization of jewellery demand in India. While Titan has a storied legacy of 23% earnings per share (EPS) compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) for two decades, it trades at a five-year low price-to-earnings (PE) due to three controversies, they said.Those are the rapid rise in gold price , jewellery demand is becoming more formal, contemporary and competition is increasing, and natural diamond-lab grown diamond (LGD) dynamics. Analysts said natural diamond-LGD dynamics threatens its studded jewellery sales, which provide higher margins. While this is a key long-term risk, we think the 1-2- year impact may be muted.Cantor has initiated its coverage of Ambuja Cement with an overweight rating and a target price of Rs 745. Analysts said from a regional leader the company is now a pan-Indian champion, which is also transforming the cement industry. The company is also enhancing its cost leadership through various initiatives, alongside its plans to reduce raw material costs by 8-10%.They believe Ambuja's shares could trade at an 18.5x in bull case scenario, resulting in a price of Rs 1,000.UBS resumed its coverage of Reliance Industries with a buy rating and a target price of Rs 1,750.

They also feel diversified O2C reduces cyclicality as new energy scales up in coming years.

They said DMart is gaining edge on ratings and engagement, and the company stands out on the quality of its reviews and number of reviews in metro areas and smaller towns.

Lull after storm: Layoff fears haunt garment unit workers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/lull-after-storm-layoff-fears-haunt-garment-unit-workers/articleshow/123553454.cms,".

Noida: Garment units find themselves in a vacuum during what would normally be peak production season. If not for the 50% US tariffs, they would now be getting into top gear for the spring 2026 line. But those orders have already been shipped in a major production rush to beat the tariffs. Without fresh US orders, many shop floors are, for the first time, working below capacity at this time of year.To contractual workers - unskilled hands like loaders, washers and lifters who are at the bottom of the chain - the telltale signs have been visible for weeks. May-Sept is when unskilled workers like Bharat Prajapati get jobs, but this year, he could not find one. ""I had to get a construction job,"" he said on Wednesday.At factories, machines are running for non-US orders, but there is no urgency. The days are easier, but not comforting for Poonam Yadav, a stitcher. ""Fabric has come but the manager is going slow with stitching work. There's normally pressure to complete 10 pieces a day. Now, five seems to be fine. It shows something is wrong,"" she said.Garment workers are confused about US tariffs and their implications, but fewer working hours and slower shifts have fuelled a growing sense of unease.Till last month, orders were being completed by working overtime as exporters rushed to ship consignments before the additional 25% tariffs came into place. It led some of them to believe this would perhaps be a bumper season. Instead, over the last 10 days, a slowdown set in.At a unit in Sector 4, lunchtime conversations are filled with speculation. ""We heard a list of low-output performers is being made because job cuts are coming because of Trump's decision,"" said Gyanesh Kumar.Whispers have reached labour contractors too. Dharmendra Nagar, who supplies workers to factories in Noida, said, ""New hiring is on hold, and it seems even some existing staffers may not be retained after Sept if the tariff situation stays the same."" He said there were many families where both husband and wife work in garment factories.Tikaram, manager at an export firm in Sector 59, said companies have cut back even on skilled labour hired per piece to protect margins. ""During peak season, around 30-40 extra skilled labour is usually hired, but not this time,"" he said.The HR manager of a garment firm said senior management had told them to quash rumours of layoffs and keep morale high. ""We have been told talks are on with govt and a solution will come soon,"" the manager added.","Garment units find themselves in a vacuum during what would normally be peak production season.

"In Delhi's neighbourhood, Trump tariff hits mood",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/in-delhis-neighbourhood-trump-tariff-hits-mood/articleshow/123553440.cms,"Gurgaon: Either side of Delhi, the mood was grim Wednesday at India's largest export hubs for readymade garments as 50% tariffs announced by US President Donald Trump kicked in, coinciding with the start of India's festive season.The immediate effect is a halt in orders and bargaining from clients asking exporters to share the burden, industry insiders told TOI. Gurgaon and Noida house some of India's biggest garment exporters - from sequined tops to polo shirts, resort wear and kaftans - supplying brands like Target, GAP, Tommy Hilfiger, Ralph Lauren, Macy's, Zara and Walmart.India is the sixth largest exporter of textiles and apparel globally. The additional 25% tariff, which Trump linked to India's purchase of Russian oil, comes as a hammer blow because nearly half of India's textile and apparel exports go to the US and EU. India makes about 22,000 million pieces of garments annually and in 2023-24 shipped textiles worth $34.4 billion.Ramandeep Singh of Boutique International feared closure of units and job losses since finding new markets won't be easy.""Buyers called me and asked me to absorb at least 20-30% of the additional costs. I will give discounts for orders already in the pipeline, but it is not sustainable for future orders. Eventually, buyers will shift to Bangladesh, Pakistan, Cambodia and Indonesia, which have lower tariffs,"" Singh said, adding that firms dependent on the US for one-third of their business face the worst squeeze.Bangladesh and Vietnam - India's main competitors - now have a clear edge with their tariffs capped at 20%.Visharad Gautam, central executive committee member of Indian Industries Association (Greater Noida chapter), said earlier orders were shipped before the tariff kicked in. ""The immediate effect is on raw materials. Bookings have almost stopped, which will soon affect production,"" he added.Job losses, according to Gautam, are inevitable if the tariff continues because textiles are India's most labour-intensive industry. ""Skilled workers are being retained since replacing them is difficult. Firms may lay off non-skilled staff,"" he said. The textile and apparel sector contributes 2.3% to India's GDP, accounts for 12% of exports and 13% of industrial output.Arvind Rai of Modelama Export said, ""Industry representatives are talking to govt, but so far, there is no clarity. By the time govt wakes up, it might be too late. What will the industry do with support if there are no orders?""In this gloom, a silver lining is the margins garment businesses enjoy, one exporter said. Margins will allow bigger players to retain the US clients by offering steep discounts that reduce profitability but keep them afloat.Gautam of IIA remained hopeful the disruption would not last. One reason, he said, is India's strategic role in the global supply chain. ""Supply of raw materials to Bangladesh will be affected too. India cannot be ignored. For example, when political unrest disrupted Bangladesh, Indian orders increased 20%,"" he said.Vikash Gupta of Manesar Industry Welfare Association said exporters had rushed to ship whatever they could in recent weeks. ""Today I received four calls from buyers and everyone was asking for discount. They expect 25-30%,"" said Gupta, who exports leather products to US. ""My business is on a ventilator,"" he said.Satvir Singh, vice-president of CITU Haryana, said govt must roll out immediate measures to protect workers. ""It (tariff) will affect workers and industry. Workers will come out on streets if jobs go. We will protest like farmers' agitation, if needed,"" he said.",Gurgaon and Noida house some of India's biggest garment exporters.

Ethanol-blended petrol push: Car experts warn E20 petrol may reduce fuel efficiency by 2 to 5 percent; warn of long-term erosion impact,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/ethanol-blended-petrol-push-car-experts-warn-e20-petrol-may-reduce-fuel-efficiency-by-2-to-5-percent-warn-of-long-term-erosion-impact/articleshow/123496104.cms,".

How leading automakers reacted



The adoption of 20 per cent ethanol-blended petrol (E20) could lead to a 2-5 per cent reduction in fuel efficiency, depending on the type of vehicle, according to automotive industry experts.India is fast-tracking its shift to E20 fuel, a mix of 20% ethanol and 80% petrol, aimed at lowering carbon emissions and reducing reliance on imported crude oil. The nationwide rollout, initially scheduled for 2030, has been moved up to 2025.Engineers associated with major automakers said older vehicles that are not E20-compliant may experience long-term wear in components such as gaskets, fuel hoses, and pipes, though these issues are not expected to appear immediately.""There can be a drop in mileage ranging from 2-5 per cent, depending on the type of vehicle. This is purely because of the lower calorific value of ethanol compared to petrol,"" an expert, who requested anonymity, was quoted as saying by PTI.Earlier this month, the Oil Ministry clarified that claims suggesting E20 causes a “drastic” reduction in fuel efficiency are misplaced. The ministry noted that E10 vehicles have shown only marginal efficiency drops, saying, “for some manufacturers, vehicles have been E20 compatible from as far back as 2009.The question of any drop in fuel efficiency in such vehicles does not arise.""The ministry highlighted that vehicles tuned for E20 deliver better acceleration, a key factor in city driving, and that ethanol’s higher heat of vaporisation reduces intake manifold temperatures, increasing air-fuel mixture density and boosting volumetric efficiency.""Ethanol, being lower in energy density than petrol, results in a marginal decrease in mileage, estimated at 1-2 per cent for four-wheelers designed for E10 and calibrated for E20, and around 3-6 per cent in others,” the ministry said through a post on X earlier this month.Several reports indicate that many motorists are concerned about E20 fuel’s potential impact on fuel efficiency.A Public Interest Litigation (PIL) was filed in the Supreme Court last week, challenging the nationwide rollout of 20% ethanol-blended petrol (E20). The plea, submitted by advocate Akshay, contends that millions of vehicles, including cars and two-wheelers made before 2023 and some newer BS-VI models, are not designed to run on high ethanol blends.When approached for comments, Maruti Suzuki and Hyundai Motor India declined, while a Tata Motors spokesperson confirmed that their vehicles are E20-compliant.""E20 usage will not have any impact on engines of compliant vehicles, as the materials are tuned for it. However, in vehicles, which are not E20 compatible, there could be erosion of gaskets and fuel rubber hoses and pipes in the long term, but not immediately,” another spokesperson was quoted as saying by PTI.The government has been promoting E20 blending as part of a national programme aimed at reducing emissions and boosting farmers’ income through ethanol production from sugarcane and maize.","India is fast-tracking its shift to E20 fuel, a mix of 20% ethanol and 80% petrol. The nationwide rollout, initially scheduled for 2030, has been moved up to 2025. Older vehicles that are not E20-compliant may experience long-term wear in components.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123496110,imgsize-1143252,width-400,resizemode-4/123496110.jpg"

Trump’s fresh warning to Russia

US President Donald Trump has issued a fresh warning of ‘economic war’ to Russia if Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy fail to resolve their ongoing conflict.According to a Bloomberg report, Trump said the ‘economic war’ would be ‘very bad’ for Russia. ""It will not be a world war, but it'll be an economic war, and an economic war is going to be bad. It's going to be bad for Russia, and I don't want that,"" Trump said during a White House cabinet meeting, Bloomberg reported.Despite Trump's pledge to terminate Russia's Ukrainian campaign upon taking office, the situation has been difficult, even following the landmark August 15 Trump-Putin summit in Anchorage, which was anticipated to facilitate progress.Also Read | ‘Country first, commerce later’: Indian refiners unlikely to stop Russia crude oil trade under US pressure; ‘message from government is…’ Trump has consistently warned of sanctions and additional repercussions for Moscow and countries whose Russian oil purchases he believes finance its military operations.Whilst he has implemented increased tariffs of 50% on Indian imports due to their Russian oil procurement, he has refrained from imposing similar measures on China and other countries purchasing Russian petroleum.When questioned about establishing a deadline for Putin to accept bilateral discussions with Zelenskiy before implementing proposed sanctions, Trump addressed the matter directly.""It's very serious what I have in mind, if I have to do it,"" Trump declared, in reference to the significant weekly casualties resulting from the conflict.The diplomatic efforts between Putin and Zelenskiy, facilitated by Trump, suggested a potential first face-to-face dialogue between the opposing leaders since Russia's comprehensive invasion of its neighbouring state over three years ago.Also Read | 'If West criticises, you are doing right..’: Russia slams Trump’s 25% penal tariffs on India - 10 hard-hitting statements for reality check to US Despite initial optimism following the Alaska discussions, no concrete meeting arrangements have materialised.

The global flow of parcels to the United States has been thrown into chaos after several countries temporarily suspended shipments following the Trump administration’s removal of the “de minimis” tariff exemption. The exemption, which allowed shipments of goods worth $800 or less to enter the US duty-free, which were eliminated starting August 26.The new rules, aimed at bolstering domestic manufacturing by slowing low-cost imports, have triggered disruptions in postal networks and e-commerce supply chains. Small businesses and individual sellers worldwide are struggling to find alternatives as parcels face duties ranging from $80 to $200 depending on the country’s tariff rate.Australia Post has temporarily partially suspended postal services to the US and Puerto Rico, effective August 26, citing changes in US customs rules and the elimination of the de minimis exemption. “We are disappointed we have had to take this action, however, due to the complex and rapidly evolving situation, a temporary partial suspension has been necessary to allow us to develop and implement a workable solution for our customers,” the postal service said.Australian retailers, including e-commerce brands, have reported significant logistical challenges.“This response is in-line with action taken by numerous postal operators internationally,” it added.Japan Post announced a temporary suspension of small parcels valued over $100 destined for the US, effective August 27. Economy Minister Ryosei Akazawa said alternative shipping options remain available, but the move is expected to affect low-value e-commerce shipments.Chunghwa Post has stopped sending small parcels to the US from August 26. The postal service cited a lack of a global system to prepay customs duties and the suspension of merchandise mail by contracted carriers.The country's postal service, called Chunghwa Post, said it has stopped delivering packages as “the global postal system has not yet provided a service allowing senders to prepay customs duty, and Chunghwa Post’s contracted carriers have also announced suspension of merchandise mail deliveries,"" as quoted by CNN.India’s postal service has temporarily suspended some outbound shipments to the US, noting logistical challenges and uncertainty over the new tariff rules.Thailand Post has announced a temporary halt on certain parcels to the US, especially low-value shipments, due to the removal of the de minimis exemption.Korea Post has suspended some parcel deliveries to the US, though customers can still send items via private carriers such as UPS.New Zealand Post has temporarily stopped some outbound mail to the US, citing uncertainty over customs and tariff compliance under the new rules.Hongkong Post has stopped accepting surface mail to the US immediately, and air mail items from April 27. The move was described as a response to “bullying” tariff hikes by the US administration.European postal operators and DHL have joined the wave of suspensions, with DHL halting acceptance of shipments to the US from August 25. The move affects low-value parcels from individuals and small businesses.","Australia Post has temporarily suspended postal services to the US and Puerto Rico.

The American planemaker has secured a series of major contracts in recent months.Korean Air CEO Cho Won-tae, who toured one of Boeing’s US factories ahead of the announcement, told Reuters the investment would help South Korea’s largest airline expand to more destinations across the United States, Latin America and South America.Cho said about half of the new 103 aircraft would be 737 MAX 10 planes, with the rest split between 777-9 and 787 jets. He added that around 80% of the new fleet would replace older planes currently in service.He noted that the company had faith in Boeing despite prior troubles the planemaker experienced.According to South Korea’s industry ministry, the Boeing portion of the order is worth $36.2 billion, alongside the GE deal. Boeing said the agreement would also aid Korean Air’s integration with Asiana Airlines, which it acquired last year.“As Korean Air transitions to a larger unified carrier, we are committed to supporting the airline's growth with one of the world's most efficient fleets,” Stephanie Pope, president and CEO of Boeing Commercial Airplanes told Reuters.US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick hailed the deal as a boost for American exports. “The world recognizes that our aircraft are the most advanced in the world, and this administration is committed to reshoring advanced manufacturing jobs for Americans,"" he said.The agreement follows earlier discussions. In March, South Korea’s industry ministry revealed Korean Air was preparing to finalise a $32.7 billion order for Boeing aircraft and GE engines. Last year, the airline announced plans to buy 20 Boeing 777-9s and 20 787-10s, with options for 10 more aircraft. The new order is separate from that commitment.Korean Air was founded in 1969 after the state-owned Korean Air Lines was taken over by conglomerate Hanjin Kal, is a founding member of the SkyTeam airline alliance.","Korean Air announced a record-breaking $50 billion order for 103 Boeing aircraft and GE Aerospace engines and servicing.

Donald Trump vs Fed governor: US President’s attempts to fire Lisa Cook might land in legal battle; Biden appointee vows not to resign,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/donald-trump-vs-fed-governor-us-presidents-attempts-to-fire-lisa-cook-might-land-in-legal-battle-biden-appointee-vows-not-to-resign/articleshow/123529511.cms,"U.S. Dollar CRASHES Hours After Trump's Unprecedented Move Against Fed Governor Cook | Details

US President Donald Trump’s attempt to dismissal Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook is expected to land in court, raising questions over the extent of presidential powers against the traditionally independent central bank.Legal experts say Trump’s claim that he can fire Cook, a Biden appointee, is legally weak but unprecedented. The Supreme Court has recently allowed presidents more authority to remove agency officials, but the Fed has never faced such a challenge.If Trump succeeds, the Fed’s political independence could be weakened, a shift economists warn may make it harder to curb inflation. Without independence, the central bank could be forced into politically driven decisions, pushing up borrowing costs for mortgages, car loans and businesses.“It's an illegal firing, but the president’s going to argue, ‘The Constitution lets me do it,’” said Lev Menand, a Columbia University law professor and author of a book on the Fed. “And that argument’s worked in a few other cases so far this year.”Menand added that the Supreme Court could effectively set new constitutional law in this case.Cook, who joined the Fed board in 2022, is likely to seek an injunction against Trump’s order so she can continue serving.That leaves the Fed in a difficult position.“They have their own legal obligation to follow the law,” Menand said.“And that does not mean do whatever the president says. ... The Fed is under an independent duty to reach its own conclusions about the legality of Lisa Cook’s removal.”Trump announced Cook’s dismissal late on Monday via a Truth Social post, claiming she was guilty of mortgage fraud.Cook immediately rejected the move, saying “President Trump purported to fire me ‘for cause’ when no cause exists under the law, and he has no authority to do so,” she said in an emailed statement.“I will not resign.”The fraud allegations were made last week by Bill Pulte, a Trump appointee at the agency regulating Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Pulte alleged Cook listed two primary residences, in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and Atlanta, in 2021 to secure better mortgage terms. Mortgage rates are generally higher on second homes or rentals.Cook has brought in Washington lawyer Abbe Lowell to represent her. Lowell said Trump’s “reflex to bully is flawed and his demands lack any proper process, basis or legal authority,” adding, “We will take whatever actions are needed to prevent his attempted illegal action.”Cook is the first Black woman to serve as a Federal Reserve governor. A Marshall Scholar, she studied at Oxford University and Spelman College, and has taught at Michigan State University and Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government.","US President Donald Trump's attempt to dismissal Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook is expected to land in court.

US to buy stakes in Lockheed Martin, Boeing?

The Donald Trump administration seems to be eyeing America’s top defence giants for a stake after it struck a deal with Intel last week. The US government is evaluating potential ownership stakes in defence industry firms, including Lockheed Martin Corp, US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has said.According to a Reuters report, Lutnick confirmed this development on Tuesday whilst supporting President Donald Trump's initiative for increased government involvement in American industry.""They're thinking about it,"" Lutnick told CNBC, citing Pentagon leaders, when asked if the administration was considering taking pieces of contractors such as Lockheed Martin, Boeing, or Palantir Technologies.Last week, the Trump administration revealed it had acquired nearly 10% ownership in the semiconductor manufacturer Intel.The US government had earlier stepped in to finalise Nippon Steel's acquisition of US Steel in June, securing what Trump referred to as a ""golden share"" that provides Washington control over its functions.A significant debate has emerged regarding defence procurement. According to Lutnick, Lockheed Martin derives 97% of its revenue from US government contracts, effectively functioning as a government extension.""There's a lot of talking that needs to be had about how do we finance our munitions acquisitions,” Lutnick saidLockheed Martin, whose shares increased by 1.7%, issued a statement confirming their ongoing positive collaboration with President Trump's administration to enhance national defence capabilities.Boeing's shares rose 2.1%, and Palantir's stock, after an initial minor decline of approximately 1%, demonstrated a 1.7% increase during New York's midday trading, the Reuters report said.The comments represent another instance of unprecedented White House involvement in private industry, with interventions typically reserved for wartime scenarios or for protecting crucial domestic enterprises during economic difficulties.Recently, the Trump administration also acquired ownership in MP Materials, a rare earths firm, and facilitated an agreement with Nvidia and AMD requiring them to share 15% of their revenue from Chinese sales of previously restricted chips.During his Monday address, Trump expressed his intention to increase government funding in robust American enterprises, despite concerns from opponents who suggest such governmental involvement could restrict business flexibility and market responsiveness, whilst raising questions about consumer implications.The extraordinary degree of federal government involvement in economic matters has led to surprising collaborations, including liberal US Senator Bernie Sanders supporting the investment in Intel.On Tuesday, Lutnick said that organisations seeking federal aid must be ready to interact with Trump.""If a company comes to the United States of America government and says: 'We need your help, we want to change everything' ... I think that's a question between the CEO and the president of the United States of whether he will listen to them and change the rules,"" he told CNBC, citing the Nvidia deal.""If we are adding fundamental value to your business, I think it's fair for Donald Trump to think about the American people,"" Lutnick added.","US to buy stakes in Lockheed Martin, Boeing?

US economy: Consumer confidence slips again in August; job market fears rise for eighth month,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-economy-consumer-confidence-slips-again-in-august-job-market-fears-rise-for-eighth-month/articleshow/123529222.cms,"American consumers became less confident of the US economy in August, as worries over the jobs market continuing to mount for the eighth month in a row.Figures released on Tuesday by the Conference Board showed that its consumer confidence index slipped to 97.4 in August from 98.7 in July, a 1.3-point decline. The reading, though modest, stayed within the same tight range recorded over the past three months and matched economists’ expectations.Short-term expectations for income, business conditions and employment also weakened, falling by 1.2 points to 74.8. Remaining well below the 80 mark, the figure is seen by many economists as a signal that recession risks are rising. Consumers’ assessment of current conditions edged down too, at 131.2 in August compared with 132.8 the month before.Despite unemployment and layoffs still being historically low, analysts say that the labour market has lost momentum this year, with increasing signs that job seekers are struggling.In July, US employers created only 73,000 jobs, far fewer than the 115,000 economists had forecast. Revisions to earlier figures for May and June erased another 258,000 jobs. The unemployment rate also crept up from 4.1% to 4.2%.The disappointing update shook financial markets and led US President Donald Trump to dismiss Erika McEntarfer, the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which publishes the monthly figures.Government data from June highlighted further weakness, with job openings falling to 7.4 million from 7.7 million in May. The number of workers quitting their jobs, a measure of confidence in finding new opportunities, also declined.More updates on the labour market are expected next week when August’s hiring and June’s job openings reports are released.The Conference Board added that mentions of inflation and high prices had risen again in August, often linked to tariffs. Separate data this month showed consumer prices were steady between June and July, but wholesale inflation jumped unexpectedly. Economists warn that tariffs on imports are pushing up costs for businesses and could soon result in higher prices for households.The share of Americans expecting a recession within the next year rose in August to the highest level since April, when the tariff measures were first rolled out.","Consumer confidence index slipped to 97.4 in August from 98.7 in July.

The global flow of parcels to the United States has been thrown into chaos after 25 countries decided to halt shipments, as fears over US President’s looming tariffs grow.The Universal Postal Union (UPU), a United Nations agency, confirmed on Tuesday that several nations had suspended deliveries due to uncertainty created by President Donald Trump’s new tariff rules.""The postal operators of 25 member countries have already advised the UPU that they have suspended their outbound postal services to the US, citing uncertainties specifically related to transit services,"" the organisation said in a statement cited by AFP.The decision follows earlier moves by postal operators in Asia and Europe. Australia’s government-owned postal service had also announced temporarily halting parcel deliveries to the US, citing changes made by Washington to long-standing customs rules.Australia Post said the action was unavoidable after the Trump administration scrapped a regulation that had allowed low-value packages to enter the US duty-free. From 29 August, the US will impose duties on goods valued at $800 or below, suspending the “de minimis” exemption.Under the new rules, parcels sent through the postal system face one of two tariffs: either an ""ad valorem duty"" equal to the effective tariff rate of the package's country of origin, or, for six months, a flat charge of $80 to $200 depending on the country’s tariff rate, Reuters reported.Packages to the US and Puerto Rico lodged on or after 26 August will not be accepted until further notice. Letters, documents, and gifts worth under $100 are exempt.""We are disappointed we have had to take this action, however, due to the complex and rapidly evolving situation, a temporary partial suspension has been necessary to allow us to develop and implement a workable solution for our customers,"" Australia Post said in a statement.Japan Post also announced on Monday that it had suspended some items, though economy minister Ryosei Akazawa insisted the impact would be limited since other shipping options remained available.

The Asian Development Bank is set to finance improvements to Pakistan's railway infrastructure, taking over from China following extended delays in securing Chinese funding that risked affecting a crucial mining venture, according to sources quoted by Reuters.The initial plan for renovating 1,800 km of railways was a key component of China's $60 billion investment initiative in Pakistan, announced in 2015 as part of the Belt and Road Initiative. However, after ten years of discussions, the railway upgrade financing remains unresolved, whilst Pakistan faces challenges in repaying existing Chinese project debts.Sources familiar with the matter told Reuters that the ADB is finalising arrangements to spearhead a $2 billion upgrade of a 500-km railway section from Karachi to Rohri. This development has become crucial for transporting copper ore from the Reko Diq mine, currently under development by Canada's Barrick Mining Corp.""We will have a crisis. How will you evacuate output from Reko Diq? The exhausted line will come under even more pressure,"" stated a senior government official. Pakistan's railways ministry offered no immediate response, while China's foreign ministry affirmed, ""China and Pakistan are iron friends and all-weather strategic partners.""The ADB declined to confirm the financing arrangement but acknowledged ongoing discussions with Pakistan regarding railway sector development. The agreement, anticipated to be announced this month, involves the ADB leading a consortium and selecting an international engineering contractor through competitive bidding.The diplomatic considerations have been addressed with China, according to sources. The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor has seen reduced momentum, with the last significant project completed in 2022. Pakistan faces challenges with payments for Chinese-built power stations and seeks debt restructuring.The Reko Diq copper and gold mine, crucial to Pakistan's mining sector development, aims to commence production in 2028, yielding approximately 200,000 metric tonnes of copper concentrate annually. The ADB-backed railway upgrade will enhance the track system for faster diesel train operations between Karachi and Rohri.The project faces additional challenges, including security concerns in Balochistan province, where militant activities frequently target railway infrastructure. Tim Cribb, Reko Diq's project director, confirmed collaborative efforts between the government and Barrick regarding financing for the western railway branch to Rohri.","The Asian Development Bank is set to finance improvements to Pakistan's railway infrastructure, taking over from China.

'There will be more transactions': More Intel-like deals coming soon? What Donald Trump's aide said,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/there-will-be-more-transactions-more-intel-like-deals-coming-soon-what-donald-trumps-aide-said/articleshow/123507643.cms,"Donald Trump

After its deal with Intel, the US could be paving a new way to build wealth by investing in more private companies.US President Donald Trump’s top economic adviser, Kevin Hassett, said on Monday that more such investments may follow.Hassett, who heads the National Economic Council, told CNBC that Trump’s push for a sovereign wealth fund is part of the plan. “I'm sure that at some point there'll be more transactions” in the semiconductor industry or others, he said.The comments came after Washington agreed to take a 9.9% stake in Intel, valued at $8.9 billion. Under the deal, the US government will receive 433.3 million shares of common stock.The money comes in part from $5.7 billion in grants under the CHIPS and Science Act, a law passed during Joe Biden’s presidency but criticised by Trump, along with funding from another award.Hassett said that the shift marks a new approach.“In the past, the federal government has been giving money away,” he said. By contrast, under the Intel deal, “these are going to be shares that don't have voting rights.” He further added that the government does not intend to interfere in how companies are run.However, Intel flagged potential risks in a securities filing on Monday. The company warned that the government’s equity stake could reduce its chances of winning future grants and that uncertainties remain around the timing and conditions of funding.It also cautioned that its global business might be “adversely impacted” by the US government being a major shareholder.Critics fear that politics could start to drive business decisions, hurting the company’s prospects.The strategy is tied to Trump’s wider vision. In February, soon after returning to the White House, his administration unveiled plans to establish a sovereign wealth fund for the world’s largest economy. Such funds, common in resource-rich nations, use state reserves to secure long-term financial returns.For now, Hassett described the Intel case as exceptional. He said that it came out of “a very, very special circumstance because of the massive amount of CHIPS act spending that was coming Intel's way,” he explained.","US President Donald Trump's top economic adviser, Kevin Hassett, said on Monday that more such investments may follow.

Billionaire Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence startup xAI has filed a lawsuit against Apple and OpenAI in a US federal court in Texas, accusing the two companies of conspiring to stifle competition in the fast-growing AI market, reported Reuters.According to the complaint, Apple and OpenAI have “locked up markets to maintain their monopolies and prevent innovators like X and xAI from competing.”Musk’s company alleges that Apple’s exclusive partnership with OpenAI, integrating ChatGPT into iPhones, iPads, and Macs, has effectively shut out rivals from gaining prominence on the Apple App Store.“If not for its exclusive deal with OpenAI, Apple would have no reason to refrain from more prominently featuring the X app and the Grok app in its App Store,” the lawsuit states.Neither Apple nor OpenAI has responded yet.The legal challenge follows Musk’s public threats earlier this month, when he posted on his social media platform X that Apple’s behavior “makes it impossible for any AI company besides OpenAI to reach #1 in the App Store.”Launched less than two years ago, xAI is positioning itself as a challenger to OpenAI and Microsoft-backed AI initiatives, as well as to Chinese startup DeepSeek.Musk has tied the company closely with his other ventures: xAI acquired X (formerly Twitter) for $33 billion earlier this year to boost chatbot training and has integrated its Grok AI assistant into Tesla vehicles.This is not Musk’s first legal battle with OpenAI. He is separately suing the company and its CEO Sam Altman in California, seeking to challenge its transition from a nonprofit—founded with his backing in 2015—to a for-profit model.Apple’s App Store policies have long drawn scrutiny. In an ongoing case brought by “Fortnite” maker Epic Games, a judge ordered Apple to open its payment system to greater competition, highlighting growing regulatory and legal pressure on the tech giant.","Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence startup xAI has filed a lawsuit against Apple and OpenAI.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume.

Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran Udaan until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.Udaan built an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business still accounts for a very small part of India’s overall retail market but can balloon to $150 billion in sales and yield a 100% return on capital invested in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co. estimates published in the Mint newspaper.Bengaluru-based Udaan has also ventured into financing through its fintech unit which helps shopkeepers get working capital loans to buy inventory. That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says.

How India's GDP has been growing

What SBI report said on savings and investment

Incremental capital output ratio

NEW DELHI: India's gross domestic product (GDP) data for the third quarter (October-December 2022) received a word of caution from the former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan In an interview with news agency PTI, Rajan that India is ""dangerously close"" to the Hindu rate of growth in view of subdued private sector investment, high interest rates and slowing global growth.India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying"".However, a report released by the State Bank of India (SBI) economists on Tuesday dismissed arguments that India is dangerously close to Hindu rate of growth saying such statements are ""ill-conceived, biased and premature"".The term 'Hindu growth rate' was coined by late economist Raj Krishna in 1978 to describe the slow growth in the country.It basically refers to the low pace of economic growth rates during 1950s to 1980s. During this period, the Indian economy averaged 3.5%.A former lecturer at the Delhi School of Economics (DSE), Krishna noted that only if the rate of growth is persistently slow and accompanied by low per-capita GDP, then it will be known as Hindu rate of growth but it has to factor in population growth as well.Before economic reforms of 1991, India's economic growth remained stagnant and low, while per capita income averaged around 1.3%. Krishna termed this low growth situation to be a result of socialist policies of state control and import substitution.However, the economic situation changed when liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation (LPG) reforms came into effect in the year 1991, at a time when India faced balance of payment crisis.Over the years, many economists have strongly opposed the idea of 'Hindu growth rate' and the term never had universal acceptance.The Indian economy plunged into its very first technical recession in FY21 due to the impact of Covid-19 pandemic and the related nationwide lockdowns. GDP shrunk by an unprecedented 23.8% in the first quarter of the financial year 2020-21. However, due to spurt in economic activities in the subsequent quarters, the GDP decline started to narrow.However, if we look at the period before Covid-19 as well, India's growth curve shows a declining trend.From 8.26% in FY17, GDP growth plunged to 3.74% in FY20. Shutdown of economic activities in FY21 in wake of Covid-19 only made matters worse.As lockdowns started to ease and business activities resumed, India's GDP also started rising. In Q1 of FY22, growth jumped to 20.1% mainly on account of low base effect. By the fourth quarter of FY22, growth came down to 4.10%.Similarly, the new financial year 2022-23 brought fresh economic challenges in the form of Russia-Ukraine war that impacted almost all major economies of the world, slowed the pace of growth, pushed inflation to record highs.As a result, the central banks of all advanced economies spurred into action and opted for monetary policy tightening to curb the soaring inflation.With persistently rising interest rates, India's economy grew by 4.4% in Q3 of FY23, as the Centre revised upwards GDP growth for previous year to 9.10% from 8.7% earlier.The report weighed recent GDP numbers against the available data on savings and investments for the past decade and highlighted some interesting points.""Quarterly growth numbers are noisy and should be best avoided for any serious interpretation (on an average, India's GDP growth has witnessed Rs 2 lakh crore upward revision for the 3 year ended FY23),"" the report said.Gross capital formation (GCF) by the government touched a high of 11.8% in 2021-22, up from 10.7% in 2020-21.""This also had a domino effect on private sector investment that jumped from 10 per cent to 10.8% over the same period,"" it said.In fact, Ecowrap added that the trends in GCF to gross output ratio or the plough back of funds for creation of fresh capacity shows that for public administration the ratio attained fresh peak in 2021-22 owing to the emphasis on capital expenditure in recent budgets.At the aggregate level, gross capital formation is supposed to have crossed 32% in 2022-23, the highest level since 2018-19.According to the report, in 2021-22, gross savings have risen to 30% from 29% in 2020-21.""The ratio is supposed to have crossed 31 per cent in 2022-23, the highest since 2018-19. The household savings increased sharply during the pandemic period on account of sharp accretion in financial savings such as deposits,"" said the report by SBI's Economic Research Department.While household financial savings have since then moderated from 15.4% in 2020-21 to 11.1% in 2022-23, savings in physical assets have grown sharply to 11.8% in 2021-22 from 10.7% in 2020-21.The report further analysed Incremental Capital Output ratio (ICOR) -- which measures additional units of capital (investment) needed to produce additional units of output. It said that the ratio has been improving.""ICOR which was 7.5 in FY 12 is now only 3.5 in FY22. Clearly, only half of capital is now needed for next unit of output,"" the report noted.Such reducing ICOR in the current years reflects a relatively increasing efficiency of capital and shows that the economy is on a sound footing, the report said.""From that point of view, future GDP growth rates even at 7% could still mean a decent number by any standards!,"" it added.","India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.

An employee is entitled for a 50 per cent amount of the last drawn salary as pension.OPS was discontinued by the NDA government in 2003 with effect from April 1, 2004.Under the new pension scheme (NPS), employees contribute 10 per cent of their basic salary towards pension while the government contributes 14 per cent.Governments of Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand have informed the central government/ Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA about their decision to restart OPS for their employees.The government of Punjab on November 18, 2022, issued a notification regarding implementation of OPS for the state government employees who are being covered under NPS. Jharkhand too has decided to revert to OPS.",Former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan has expressed his concern over the decision of some states to restart the old pension scheme.

The meeting was chaired by Food Secretary Sanjeev Chopra.Out of the total wheat procurement target for the 2022-23 marketing year (April-March), Punjab will aim to procure 2.5 million tonnes wheat, Haryana 1.5 million tonnes and Madhya Pradrsh 2 million tonnes, the food ministry said in a statement.Wheat procurement had declined last year due to a fall in domestic production and higher exports.However, the government has projected a record wheat production at 112.18 million tonnes in the 2023-24 crop year (July-June) as per the second estimate of the agriculture ministry.Besides wheat, the government has also fixed rabi (winter) rice procurement target at 10.6 million tonnes in the 2022-23 marketing year.States have been advised to enhance rice milling capacity so that milling of one season gets completed before the commencement of next season and recycling of rice may be avoided.Whereas procurement of millets and coarse grains is estimated to be 7,50,000 tonnes this year, higher than 6,30,000 tonnes in 2021-22.

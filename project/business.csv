Gold prices remain firm, hovering near the $4,500 level on COMEX. Meanwhile, silver continues its strong upward momentum, supported by tight supply conditions, robust industrial demand, and broader market uncertainties. Recent US economic data indicated easing inflation and softer labor market conditions, strengthening expectations of multiple rate cuts next year, even as GDP growth surprised on the upside.Gold prices are gradually trending higher, consistent with their typical behaviour, and have registered a record high of ₹140,000 following a consolidation breakout from the ₹135,000 level last week. The broader technical structure continues to favor a buy-on-dips strategy, preferably through staggered investments.There remains a possibility of prices re-testing the recent support zone between ₹137,000 and ₹138,000.After the breakout, prices have been holding near the upper Bollinger Band, indicating sustained buying interest, with the mid-band around ₹135,000 acting as an immediate stop.Any pullbacks may be used for accumulation, while a decisive move above ₹140,000 could open the way toward targets of ₹143,000–₹145,000.It is a holiday-shortened week due to the New Year, though a few key events are lined up. Focus will be on US industrial production, housing numbers and FOMC meeting minutes.","Manav Modi, Senior Analyst, Commodity Research at Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd.

Safety systems include the indigenous KAVACH anti-collision technology. Like the chair car version, the sleeper variant will also feature regenerative braking to enhance energy efficiency.

Coaches are equipped with fully sealed gangways and automatic interconnecting doors, helping maintain interior air quality and stable temperature levels.

Each coach offers individual reading lamps, charging sockets, foldable refreshment tables, and interiors finished with GFRP panels. Train doors will open automatically at designated stations.

A Centralised Coach Monitoring System has been installed, along with emergency communication facilities that allow passengers to directly contact the locomotive driver.

After months of glittering rallies, hitting record highs, gold and silver ended 2025 on a muted note as investors turn to book profits on the last day of 2025.On Wednesday, silver futures for March 2026 witnessed a sharp sell-off, plunging 6% to Rs 2,35,952 per kg on the MCX, a loss of Rs 15,060 in a single session. Gold futures for February 2026 also edged lower, slipping 0.4% to Rs 1,36,124 per 10 grams. The correction was far steeper in silver, which had recently surged to all time highs.The pause came after a strong rally earlier in the week. In the previous session, bullion prices had rebounded sharply from intraday lows, supported by renewed safe-haven demand. Gold February futures had closed 1.28% higher at Rs 1,36,666 per 10 grams, while silver March futures had jumped 11.84% to Rs 2,51,012 per kg on the MCX.Global markets took a cautious tone. International gold and silver prices edged lower on December 31 as traders booked profits near all-time highs. Spot gold fell 0.3% to around $4,334 an ounce in early Asian trade, after touching a record high of $4,549.71 last week. US gold futures for February delivery declined 1% to $4,346.50 an ounce. Even with the late pullback, both metals are set to end 2025 with historic annual gains.Markets became cautious after Russia alleged that Ukraine carried out a drone attack on the President’s residence, weakening expectations of a near-term peace deal. Additionally, reports of US airstrikes on a Venezuelan dock and a Chinese military exercise in waters close to Taiwan, also pushed investors towards gold and silver as traditional safe-haven assets.Manoj Kumar Jain of Prithvifinmart Commodity Research told ET that in the short term, bullion prices are supported by geopolitical developments. However, he cautioned that the US Federal Reserve’s meeting minutes released on Tuesday reduced the likelihood of aggressive interest rate cuts in 2026, which may limit further upside in precious metal prices.Adding to the headwinds, the US Dollar Index held steady near 98.28, up 0.04%, hitting the momentum in gold.Sharing his trading view, Jain highlighted major technical levels for the MCX. Gold has support at Rs 1,35,200–1,34,000 and resistance at Rs 1,37,700–1,39,200. For silver, support lies between Rs 2,40,000 and Rs 2,28,000, while resistance is seen in the Rs 2,62,000–2,75,000 range.He advised investors to wait for clearer price stability before taking fresh positions and to strictly avoid short selling amid heightened market volatility.","Gold and silver ended 2025 on a muted note as investors turn to book profits.

Domestic natural gas consumption to surge by 3-4% in FY27 by expansion of City Gas Distribution: ICRA,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/domestic-natural-gas-consumption-to-surge-by-3-4-in-fy27-by-expansion-of-city-gas-distribution-icra/articleshow/126282052.cms,"Domestic natural gas consumption to surge by 3-45 in FY27 by expansion of City Gas Distribution: ICRA

The domestic natural gas consumption is expected to rebound and grow by 3-4% year-on-year in FY2027 after witnessing a phase of near-term moderation in FY2026, according to a report by ICRA.The report highlighted that the recovery in gas consumption will be driven by a pickup in industrial offtake and the continued expansion of the City Gas Distribution (CGD) network. ICRA expects higher gas usage from key consuming sectors such as refining, fertilisers and CGD to support this growth in FY2027.It stated ""India's natural gas consumption is expected to grow by 3-4 per cent year-on-year in FY2027, following a period of near-term moderation in FY2026"".ICRA noted that during the first seven months of FY2026, gas consumption declined by 4.5 per cent year-on-year. This drop was mainly due to lower offtake from major consuming sectors including fertilisers, power generation and refineries.While the CGD segment has continued to record healthy growth and remains a key driver of demand, overall gas consumption for FY2026 is expected to remain flat or witness low single-digit moderation.The report also pointed out that domestic gas production has remained stagnant, with any incremental output likely to be offset by the natural decline from existing gas fields. This has contributed to the subdued consumption trend in the near term.Looking ahead, ICRA said the broader energy environment is expected to be supportive. Crude oil prices are projected to average between USD 60-70 per barrel in FY2027 due to muted global demand growth amid rising supplies.Even at these price levels, the profitability of domestic crude oil producers is expected to remain healthy, and their capital expenditure plans are likely to stay intact.At the same time, domestic consumption of petroleum products is expected to grow by 1-2 per cent in FY2027.On the global front, LNG prices have eased due to expectations of warmer winters in key regions and healthy inventory levels. Additionally, significant LNG capacity additions planned globally are expected to lead to a moderation in LNG prices from calendar year 2027. Domestic gas prices are also expected to soften in line with lower crude oil prices.Overall, the report suggested that after a year of moderation, India's natural gas consumption is set to regain momentum in FY2027, led by industrial recovery and steady growth in the CGD segment.","Domestic natural gas consumption to surge by 3-45 in FY27 by expansion of City Gas Distribution: ICRA.

Venezuela, currently in the throes of an escalating crisis with the United States, closed the books Wednesday on a complicated year for its economy, with the official cost of buying a US dollar up 479 percent in the last 12 months.The gap between the official and black market rate is mounting as well, nearing 100 percent in an economy that has become increasingly dollarized as a way to tackle hyperinflation.Even though President Nicolas Maduro projected economic growth of nearly nine percent in 2025, the oil-rich South American country has seen a sharp decline, with inflation soaring and hard currency in short supply.US President Donald Trump has piled the pressure on Maduro, stiffening sanctions and ordering the seizure of ""sanctioned oil vessels"" sailing to and from Venezuela.Venezuela's central bank on Wednesday set the official rate at 301.37 bolivars to the US dollar, a rate in effect until January 2. That marks a 479.25 percent increase from the rate of 52.02 bolivars to the dollar posted in early 2025.On the black market, where prices are determined by crypto exchange platforms, one US dollar is going for nearly 560 bolivars -- at least an 85 percent difference with the official rate.Economists say that 80 percent of Venezuela's currency exchanges are carried out on such platforms.Inflation could ultimately pass the astronomical rate of 500 percent in 2025, according to estimates from private firms.

Parul University bid farewell to the Graduating batch of 2025, holding its 9th Convocation, an event that brought together many of the national leaders and celebrated icons along with thousands of hopeful graduates. The processional entrance marked the conclusion of students’ time at the university while also signalling the beginning of their next phase, bringing graduates together for a key moment in the ceremony.More than 16,000 students graduated this year and the 9th convocation ceremony witnessed the presence of 12,000 graduates from across all disciplines, and more than 23,000 guests, including the students, parents, friends and family members. Distinguished national icons such as Minister of State for Home Affairs and Deputy CM of Gujarat- Harsh Sanghvi, Olympic Boxing Legend MC Mary Kom , Entrepreneur and Shark Tank India Judge Vineeta Singh, and Tennis Sensation Sania Mirza , graced the convocation ceremony as the chief guest and guest of honours respectively, and offered their thoughts and encouragement to the graduating class.At this year’s convocation ceremony, the university also recognised a socially relevant initiative that has positively impacted communities. Parul University worked with rural women artisans to produce more than 16,000 handcrafted Khadi scarves for the graduating students. In addition to providing an income source to the women, it enhanced their skill levels. It also helped preserve the heritage of Khadi India while advancing rural livelihoods as well as furthering the country’s ‘Vocal for Local’ and ‘Make in India’ campaigns.The highlight of the event was the felicitation of the outstanding achievers across all disciplines. This year’s celebrations spotlighted the 104 Gold Medalists and 44 Certificate of Merit awardees. The President’s Medal was presented to 3 distinguished alumni who had brought remarkable honour to the university through their professional achievements and 3 startups for their entrepreneurial spirit. Furthermore, the event also recognised a distinguished cohort of 135 PhD scholars and presented them with awards for their excellent research achievements and academic excellence. The awards reflect not only the excellence but also the dedication and perseverance of the graduate Class of 2025.MC Mary Kom, the Olympic Boxing Champion and an icon of Indian sport, carried forward the tremendous energy of the event with her inspirational presence. During her exclusive talk session, she shared, “Confidence is something we cannot take from others, we cannot buy it. You have to build it on your own. If you don’t build your confidence, then what will you achieve?” During her convocation address she said, “It’s easy to count on fingers how much you’ve won, but when you count it physically and mentally, it’s very hard. Similarly, the students sitting here, earning a degree is not an easy job and you’ve done it all brilliantly, in different departments. I’m so glad to be a part of this celebration of this success. This is just the beginning. You might think you’ve done it all and that it’s over, but it’s not. Now the real challenges begin, and what matters most is how you overcome them.Your future is just starting.”Vineeta Singh, Judge of Shark Tank India, brought a huge dose of entrepreneurial motivation and encouragement to the students. She encouraged the students to create something valuable through their creativity and hard work. Her advice to the students was, “Failure is the entry fee you need to pay for success. We have to pay it all the time.” She also added that, “It’s not about the destination. It’s about the journey. There is no such thing as a loss. Only those who believe they’ve lost, lose.” She left students with an advice, “I want you all to take a moment and breathe, because you also have to remember you come from a country that is built on creating solutions from scratch, hard work, and dedication.”Tennis legend Sania Mirza spoke about how important it is to be dedicated to your career and be able to balance your life, and to keep fighting through obstacles. She said, “you are stepping into a very new and probably very scary possibility.” Additionally, she also advised the students, “It is important to always remember that no matter how many failures you face, no matter how many rejections you face; there will always be a next day as long as you want one. Sports taught me that life lesson.” Further, she left the students with a simple message to respect parents and that we are nothing without them. She also said, “Achieve whatever and whenever it is that you decide to dream. No matter what you decide your dream will be, you are the future of our country.”Dr. Devanshu Patel, President of Parul University, gave a keynote address during the convocation ceremony that encouraged the graduates. “Remember that belief can exist even when answers do not. Remember that growth takes time. And remember that as long as you are willing to learn, adapt, and persevere, possibility remains alive. Wherever life takes you, carry this belief with you: ‘Yahan Possible Hai’ Your dreams are possible. Your journey is valid. Your future is still unfolding.” he said.The celebration was extraordinary, and the students were filled with heartfelt emotions. While many of the students on that day were rejoicing in that moment of celebrating the end of one chapter of their lives, they also acknowledged that this was only the beginning of another. Through this successful 9th convocation ceremony, Parul University reaffirms its efforts to continue to empower young minds and develop leaders who make meaningful contributions to the world.","Parul University held its 9th Convocation ceremony. More than 16,000 students graduated from the university this year. The ceremony was attended by national icons such as MC Mary Kom, Vineeta Singh, and Tennis Sensation Sania Mirza.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126282797,imgsize-1165029,width-838,resizemode-4/126282797.jpg"

The new year 2026 has just begun and if your to-do list contains a bank visit, it’s a good idea to check when banks will be closed in January. A missed holiday can easily turn a routine bank visit into a wasted trip, especially in the first few days of the year when people are settling back into work and finances.Banks in India observe a mix of national and regional holidays, which means closure dates can differ from one state to another.Banks will remained closed in Mizoram, Tamil Nadu, Sikkim, Manipur, Arunachal Pradesh, West Bengal, Nagaland and Meghalaya on the occasion of New Year's Day and Gaan-Ngai.Banks will remain closed in Mizoram, Tamil Nadu in observance of New Year Celebrations and Mannam Jayanthi.Banks will remain closed in Uttar Pradesh for birthday of Hazrat Ali.Banks in West Bengal will remain closed in observance of birth day of Swami Vivekananda.Banks in Gujarat, Odisha, Assam and Arunachal Pradesh will be shut in on the occasion of Makar Sankranti and Magh Bihu.The states of Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Sikkim, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh will remain closed for Uttarayana Punyakala, Pongal, Maghe Sankranti and Makara Sankranti.Banks in Tamil Nadu will be shut in observance of Thiruvalluvar Day.Banks in Tamil Nadu will remain closed due to Uzhavar Thirunal.Banks in Tripura, Odisha, West Bengal, will remain shut in observance of the birthday of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, Saraswati Puja (Shree Panchami), Vir Surendrasai Jayanti and Basanta Panchami.Banks will remain closed nationwide on the occasion of Republic day.Apart from these, banks also remain closed on every second and fourth Saturday of the month.Knowing bank holidays in advance can help customers plan essential financial transactions and avoid last-minute delays. However, bank closure does not means that customers can not process their financial transactions during holidays. Even when branches are shut, online banking services, ATMs, mobile banking apps and UPI for fund transfers, bill payments and other routine transactions are available for customers.However, services that require a physical visit, such as large cash deposits, cheque clearances and issuing demand drafts, will not be available. To avoid inconvenience, account holders are advised to plan these activities in advance and make the most of digital banking options during closures.","Banks will remained closed in Mizoram, Tamil Nadu, Sikkim, Manipur, Arunachal Pradesh, West Bengal, Nagaland and Meghalaya on the occasion of New Year's Day and Gaan-Ngai.

‘Remove 10-Minute Delivery Option’: Gig Workers Launch Nationwide Strike On New Year’s Eve

A nationwide New Year's eve strike to protest low pay and lack of social security benefits elicited a mixed response from delivery workers, even as app-based platforms offered festive bonuses in a bid to counter delayed service and manpower shortage. Most customers had no clue about the strike but several orders were inordinately delayed.Anticipating one of the busiest days for food and grocery delivery platforms, Eternal, Swiggy and Zepto raised pay per order for delivery partners. ""Platforms which usually pay us Rs 5-Rs 10 for delivering an order are offering an incentive in the range of Rs 110-150 per order,"" said Shaik Salauddin, founder president at Telangana Gig and Platform Workers Union, which is leading the protest alongside Indian Federation of App-Based Transport Workers. Aggregators were also offering to waive penalties on order denials and cancellations.However, a section of workers refused to relent. Siddhesh Patil (name changed), said aggregators were flooding them with New Year's Eve offers of incentives and 'double earnings', ""but these targets are impossible to achieve, anyway"". Those on strike risked having their IDs blocked by the aggregator as a punitive measure, he added.""On festivals and special days like Dec 31 and Jan 1, we don't manage to convert many food delivery orders because restaurants are packed and can't process online orders fast enough,"" he said. So even if Zomato or Swiggy promised him an extra Rs 90 per order to cover the 6-10pm rush hour slot and guaranteed a payout of Rs 2,175 to complete 19 orders in six hours, he'd still fall short of the target, he said. ""On an average day, I complete 20 orders between 9am and 11pm. Last New Year's Eve I completed 15 orders with difficulty.""On Dec 30, Zomato had sent a letter to all its employees assuring them ""no delivery partner will face any obstruction while delivering orders. So, on 31st Dec, 2025, log in without worry and earn up to Rs 3,500."" The letter went on to promise workers of on-field assistance to ""ensure their safety"" and even encouraged them to call the police if they faced interruptions.Union leaders interpret the letter as a sign that aggregators now recognise the growing resistance as a force to be reckoned with. Salauddin said they were urging gig workers to not get tempted. ""This is not a genuine solution to long-standing issues,"" said Salauddin.Gig workers are protesting pressure from 10-minute delivery models. They also seek an end to arbitrary incentive structures, ID blocking, penalties and reduction in per-order payouts.To avoid any disruptions, many restaurants are relying on their own apps and in-house delivery fleet, leveraging the situation to gain direct consumers. ""We have stepped up focus on our Wow Eats app and have been sending mass emails,"" said Sagar Daryani, co-founder & CEO at Wow! Momo Foods. Some restaurants are partnering with Shadowfax and Rapido, Daryani said. Kolkata-based restaurant Chowman said it is pushing its own app orders so that the firm's in-house fleet can seamlessly support any potential shortfall.","Gig workers are protesting pressure from 10-minute delivery models.

NEW DELHI: A month after notifying the four new labour codes, Centre on Wednesday released draft rules for their implementation, which lay out how minimum wages will be calculated, fix weekly working hours, set procedures to recognise and verify trade union membership, and provide for the composition of a National Social Security Board that will look after the welfare of gig and platform workers among other things.Under the draft rules, seeking public comments within 30-45 days, minimum daily wages will be based on the needs of a standard working-class family comprising the worker, a spouse and two children. This includes a daily intake of 2,700 calories per person, clothing needs of 66 metres a year for the family, house rent at 10% of food and clothing costs, 20% of wages for fuel, electricity and other essentials, and an additional 25% to cover education, healthcare, recreation and contingencies.An official told TOI that the calculation of minimum wage follows the principles laid down in the Reptakos Brett judgment, which took the socio-economic aspect of the wage structure into consideration, as a worker's wage is no longer a contract between an employer and an employee. ""Subsequently, the minimum wages are expected to see upward revision once the new codes come into effect.""Besides, the rules cap weekly working hours at 48, while daily working hours, rest intervals, and spread-over time will be notified separately.The proposed national social security board for gig workers will include lawmakers, representatives from states, worker and employer organisations, along with Centre's nominees.On gratuity, govt clarified that the provisions will apply prospectively from Nov 21, 2025, the date the labour codes come into force. Fixed-term employees will be eligible for gratuity after one year of continuous service, compared with five years earlier for permanent workers.The labour ministry also iterated the definition of wages under the labour codes. If components other than basic pay, dearness allowance and retaining allowance exceed 50% of total pay, the excess will be treated as wages. Performance-linked incentives, ESOPs, variable or reimbursement-based payments and leave encashment are excluded.In the meantime, old rules will remain in force until final notification of the new rules during the transition period, the ministry clarified separately.States will also need to release draft rules under the new labour codes.","Draft rules lay out how minimum wages will be calculated, fix weekly working hours, set procedures to recognise and verify trade union membership.

NEW DELHI: Cabinet Wednesday approved the construction of the 374-km greenfield access-controlled Nashik-Solapur-Akkalkot highway in Maharashtra, which is part of the Surat-Chennai high-speed corridor, at an estimated cost of Rs 19,142 crore.This will be the largest value of highway project on Build, Operate, Transfer (BOT) mode in the country's NH development history, I&B minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said.The cabinet also approved widening and strengthening of the 206-km Mohana to Koraput stretch of NH-326 in Odisha with an estimated cost of Rs 1,526 crore, which will improve connectivity to major economic and logistics corridors, and better last-mile access to Gopalpur port and Jeypore airport.PM Narendra Modi termed the decision of greenfield highway in Maharashtra as ""building next-generation infrastructure development"". On X, he said, ""This transformative project, aligned with PM Gati Shakti, will significantly reduce travel time, strengthen west-east connectivity, boost logistics cost, and create large-scale employment."" An official said this will emerge as an alternative to the existing Mumbai-Chennai corridor.Vaishnaw said the corridor will reduce travel time between Nashik and Solapur due to reduction in distance and allowing vehicles to drive at higher speed. The project will be completed in two years from the date of start of work. ""Because of this corridor, travel time between Surat and Chennai will be reduced by 45% from 31 hours at present to 17 hours. This will facilitate heavy traffic between Surat, Vadodara and Mumbai towards Kurnool, Bengaluru and Chennai.

PAN-Aadhaar Deadline Nears: How To Link Before December 31 Or Risk Inoperative PAN From Next Year

How to link PAN with Aadhaar card: Step-by-step guide

To begin with, you will have to pay a mandatory fee through the Income Tax Department’s e-Filing portal.

Visit the portal homepage (https://www.incometax.gov.in/iec/foportal/), select the Link Aadhaar option under Quick Links. Now enter your PAN card and Aadhaar card details.

After choosing to pay through e-Pay Tax, you are required to re-enter your PAN, verify your mobile number through an OTP, select the Income Tax option, and proceed to payment.

The assessment year must be selected and the payment category should be marked as Other Receipts (500). The Rs 1,000 amount is auto-filled and can be paid using net banking, debit card, or UPI. The payment may take four to five working days to reflect in the system.

Once the payment is confirmed (which can take a few days), taxpayers can make the linking request.

Go to the Link Aadhaar section, enter your PAN and Aadhaar details, and validate the information.

A confirmation message stating ""Your payment details are verified."" should appear, after which users must enter their name as per Aadhaar and their mobile number.

They are also required to confirm Aadhaar validation and indicate if only the year of birth is mentioned on their Aadhaar record.

The process is completed by entering the six-digit OTP sent to the registered mobile number.

Taxpayers can also check the status of their PAN-Aadhaar linkage without logging in. By selecting Link Aadhaar Status under Quick Links on the e-Filing homepage and entering PAN and Aadhaar details, users can view the current status. A successful linkage is indicated by a green checkmark, while pending cases will display a message stating that the request has been forwarded to UIDAI for validation.

The final date to complete your PAN–Aadhaar card linking is December 31, 2025. Beginning January 1, 2026, the Income Tax Department will declare all PAN cards that remain unlinked with Aadhaar card as inoperative.As per Notification No. 26/2025, issued on April 3, 2025, individuals who were allotted a PAN using an Aadhaar Enrolment ID before October 1, 2024 are required to complete the linkage using their permanent Aadhaar card number by the end of 2025. PAN cards that are not linked by the deadline will be marked inactive or inoperative and cannot be used for tax-related or major financial transactions, according to an ET report.The Central Board of Direct Taxes has cautioned that non-compliance will have financial consequences, including suspension of income tax refunds and the application of higher tax deduction at source rates from January 1, 2026.To complete the linkage, taxpayers must first ensure that they have a valid PAN, an Aadhaar number, and a registered mobile phone to receive one-time passwords. A fee of Rs 1,000 is applicable in cases where the PAN was issued before July 1, 2017 and has not been linked earlier, the report said.","PAN cards that are not linked by the deadline will be marked inactive or inoperative. Non-compliance will have financial consequences, including suspension of income tax refunds and the application of higher tax deduction at source rates from January 1, 2026.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126136106,imgsize-95638,width-400,resizemode-4/pan-aadhaar-linking.jpg"

US market today: Wall Street trades flat in thin year-end session; investors eye Fed outlook as 2025 draws to a close,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-market-today-wall-street-trades-flat-in-thin-year-end-session-investors-eye-fed-outlook-as-2025-draws-to-a-close/articleshow/126274419.cms,"US stocks were largely steady in light trading on the final day of 2025, as investors wrapped up a year marked by strong gains driven by optimism around artificial intelligence, alongside lingering concerns over inflation and valuations, AP reported.Early in Wednesday’s session, the S&P 500 was flat, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 47 points, or 0.1%. The Nasdaq composite was little changed. Trading volumes were muted ahead of the New Year’s Day holiday, when US markets will remain closed.The S&P 500 is up more than 17% so far in 2025, buoyed by enthusiasm around artificial intelligence and its potential to lift corporate profits. Treasury yields edged higher in the bond market.Futures trading earlier in the day had pointed to a cautious open, with S&P 500 and Dow futures down 0.1% and Nasdaq futures lower by 0.2%, as most institutional investors remained on the sidelines.While artificial intelligence stocks powered much of the market’s advance this year, the rally has also attracted scepticism. Investors remain concerned about whether AI investments will deliver sufficient profits and productivity gains to justify current valuations.Stocks linked to the AI boom, including Nvidia and Broadcom, accounted for a large share of the gains in 2025, but worries persist that prices across the broader market have risen faster than underlying earnings.Adding to the caution are concerns that a US-led trade war could stoke inflationary pressures. Although the Federal Reserve cut its benchmark interest rate three times toward the end of the year, inflation continues to remain above the central bank’s 2% target.The Fed has cited signs of a weakening labour market as a reason for easing policy, with investors awaiting fresh data on weekly jobless claims later on Wednesday as an indicator of layoffs.Minutes from the Fed’s December meeting underscored divisions among policymakers, and markets are currently betting that the central bank will hold rates steady at its January meeting, AP reported.Sung Won Sohn, professor of finance and economics at Loyola Marymount University, said uncertainty continues to build across global markets.“Central banks must tread carefully, and financial markets will likely experience continued volatility as expectations shift,” he said, AP quoted.Commodity markets remained volatile as the year wound down. Silver swung sharply lower, giving back more than 8% early Wednesday after rising over 10% a day earlier, though it remains up more than 140% for the year. Gold fell 1.5% but is still higher by 66% in 2025.US crude oil rose 31 cents to $58.26 a barrel, while Brent crude gained 28 cents to $61.61. Despite the uptick, crude prices are down about 19% for the year, with US petrol prices lower by around 6% to 7% nationally.Global equity markets were mixed. Germany, Japan and South Korea were closed for New Year holidays. France’s CAC 40 fell 0.5% by midday, while Britain’s FTSE 100 slipped 0.2%.In Asia, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng declined 0.9%, the Shanghai Composite edged up 0.1%, Taiwan’s Taiex rose 0.9%, and Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 dipped marginally.","US stocks were largely steady in light trading on the final day of 2025.

'Oracle of Omaha' steps aside: Warren Buffett retires today as Berkshire CEO after 6 decades of service; Gregory Abel takes operational charge,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/oracle-steps-aside-warren-buffett-retires-today-as-berkshire-ceo-after-6-decades-of-service-gregory-abel-takes-operational-charge/articleshow/126273869.cms,"An investor who resisted labels

Insurance float as quiet genius



A succession shaped by continuity

More than a company



Warren Buffett stepped down as chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway today, bringing to an end one of the longest and most influential leadership runs in modern corporate history.The transition, announced earlier this year at Berkshire’s annual shareholders’ meeting, hands day-to-day control to vice-chairman Gregory Abel from January 1. Buffett, now 95, will remain chairman and has said he will continue coming to the office, but his withdrawal from operational leadership closes a chapter that reshaped both Berkshire and the wider landscape of American capitalism, according to ET report.What Buffett leaves behind is a company transformed beyond recognition. Once a struggling textile maker, Berkshire is today the ninth-most-valuable company in the United States, the country’s second-largest property and casualty insurer, and a sprawling conglomerate with nearly $700 billion in tradable stocks, bonds and cash, alongside ownership of roughly 200 operating businesses. Those span railroads, utilities and consumer brands, with the annual shareholder meeting in Omaha evolving into a ritual gathering for investors from around the world, ET noted.Buffett was often described as the world’s greatest investor, though he resisted easy categorisation. He began with classic value investing, buying companies trading below the accounting value of their assets, and later embraced businesses with enduring competitive advantages capable of compounding value over decades.That evolution produced some of the most successful investments of modern times, including Apple, accumulated between 2016 and 2018 and now Berkshire’s most profitable holding. His emphasis on “economic moats” shaped a portfolio anchored by global franchises across banking, consumer goods and financial services.Yet Buffett’s most consequential insight lay not only in what he bought, but in how he paid for it.The acquisition of National Indemnity in 1967, followed by GEICO and a major reinsurance operation, gave Berkshire access to insurance float — premiums collected before claims are paid. That pool of capital became the engine behind Berkshire’s growth, financing landmark deals such as the acquisition of BNSF and the company’s large stake in Occidental Petroleum, ET reported.This structure allowed Berkshire to deploy vast sums patiently, without dependence on short-term market funding, reinforcing Buffett’s reputation for disciplined capital allocation.The move to Gregory Abel marks a shift in style rather than a break in philosophy. Abel, who rose through Berkshire’s energy and utilities businesses, inherits a decentralised organisation built on trust and autonomy. Buffett’s hands-off approach — avoiding forced synergies and central control — now stands as a defining legacy Abel must steward.The transition comes amid mixed performance across some operating businesses and renewed scrutiny of Berkshire’s unusually large cash holdings. How that capital is deployed in the years ahead will be closely watched, but the company enters the handover with financial strength few peers can match.Buffett leaves behind more than a balance sheet. He leaves a way of thinking about business — patient, long-term and grounded in common sense. He spoke often about enjoying the work itself, once remarking, “I have a lot of fun doing what I do every day.”He was equally candid about wealth and responsibility, urging restraint and purpose rather than excess. Last month, he accelerated the transfer of Berkshire shares to foundations run by his three children, amounting to about $1.3 billion. In his Thanksgiving letter, he reminded readers that “kindness is costless but also priceless,” ET reported.As Berkshire enters this historic handover, much remains unchanged: the offices, routines and culture endure. What departs is the singular presence that held them together, and the assurance that came with it.","Buffett hands day-to-day control to vice-chairman Gregory Abel from January 1. He will remain chairman and has said he will continue coming to the office. Once a struggling textile maker, Berkshire is today the ninth-most-valuable company in the United States.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126273879,imgsize-279026,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

"With the legendary Warren Buffett stepping back, Berkshire Hathaway enters a new era",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/with-the-legendary-warren-buffett-stepping-back-berkshire-hathaway-enters-a-new-era/articleshow/126255534.cms,"Greg Abel faces the challenge of taking over Berkshire Hathaway from the legendary Warren Buffett this week.Many regard Buffett as the world's greatest investor after he grew Berkshire from a struggling New England textile mill that he starting buying up for $7.60 a share in 1962, to the massive conglomerate it is today with shares that go for more than $750,000 a pop. Buffett's personal fortune of Berkshire stock is worth roughly $150 billion even after giving more than $60 billion away over the past 20 years.Berkshire for decades has routinely outpaced the S&P 500 as Buffett bought up insurance companies like Geico and National Indemnity, manufacturers like Iscar Metalworking, retail brands like Dairy Queen, major utilities and even one of the nation's biggest railroads, BNSF. Along the way, Buffett bought and sold hundreds of billions of dollars of stocks and profited handsomely from his famously long-term bets on companies like American Express, Coca-Cola and Apple.Berkshire has struggled to keep that pace in recent years because it has grown so huge and also struggled to find new and significant acquisitions. Even this fall's $9.7 billion acquisition of OxyChem probably isn't big enough to make a difference in Berkshire's profits.Investors will be watching closely to see what changes Abel might make in Berkshire's trajectory, but don't expect any seismic shifts.Buffett isn't going anywhere and Abel has already been managing all of Berkshire's noninsurance businesses since 2018. Buffett will remain chairman and plans to continue coming into the office each day to help spot new investments and offer Abel any advice he asks for.Some changes are likely CFRA Research analyst Cathy Seifert said it is natural for Abel to make some changes in the way Berkshire is run. Taking a more traditional approach to leadership with nearly 400,000 employees spread across dozens of subsidiaries makes a lot of sense, she said.But Berkshire operates under an extremely decentralized structure that trusts its executives with significant decisions. Everyone associated with the company has said there are no plans to change that.The world learned that Abel was to become the designated successor at Berkshire in 2021 when Buffett's longtime business partner, the late Charlie Munger, assured shareholders at an annual meeting that Abel would maintain the company's culture.Part of Buffett's sales pitch to company founders and CEOs thinking of selling their companies has always been that Berkshire would largely allow them to continue running their companies the same way as long as they delivered results.""I think the investment community would likely applaud Greg's management style to the degree that it sort of buttons things up,"" Seifert said. ""And if it helps performance, that can't really be faulted.""Abel plays an active role managing companies Abel has already shown himself to be a more hands-on manager than Buffett, but he still follows the Berkshire model of autonomy for acquired companies. Abel asks tough questions of company leaders and holds them accountable for their performance.Abel did announce some leadership changes earlier this month after investment manager and Geico CEO Todd Combs departed, and Chief Financial Officer Marc Hamburg announced his retirement. Abel also said he's appointing NetJets CEO Adam Johnson as manager of all of Berkshire's consumer, service and retail businesses. That essentially creates a third division of the company and takes some work off of Abel's plate. He will continue to manage the manufacturing, utility and railroad businesses.Abel will eventually face more pressure to start paying a dividend. From the beginning, Berkshire has held the position that it is better to reinvest profits rather than making quarterly or annual payouts to shareholders.But if Abel can't find a productive use of the $382 billion cash that Berkshire is sitting on, there may be a push from investors to start paying dividends or to adopt a traditional stock buyback program that would boost the value of shares they hold. Currently, Berkshire only repurchases shares when Buffett thinks they are a bargain, and he hasn't done that since early 2024.Still, Abel will be insulated from such pressure for some time since Buffett controls nearly 30% of the voting power in the stock. That will diminish gradually after his death as his children distribute his shares to charity as agreed.Berkshire has a solid foundation Many of Berkshire's subsidiaries tend to follow the economy and profit handsomely whenever the country is prosperous. Berkshire's utilities typically generate a reliable profit, and its insurance companies like Geico and General Reinsurance supply more than $175 billion worth of premiums that can be invested until claims come due.Investor Chris Ballard, who is managing director at Check Capital, said most of Berkshire's businesses ""can almost take care of themselves."" He sees a bright future for Berkshire under Abel.One of the biggest questions right now may be how much additional change there will be in company leadership after Combs' departure, if any at all. The head of the insurance unit, Vice Chairman Ajit Jain, who Buffett has long lavished with praise, is now 74 and many of the CEOs of the various companies have continued working long after retirement age because they like working for Buffett.""As a long-term shareholder, we aren't too concerned with Todd's departure and don't think this is the tip of some sort of iceberg,"" said Ballard, whose firm counts Berkshire as its largest holding. ""Todd's situation is unique. It's just a reminder that Warren's pending departure is imminent and they're preparing for a new phase - one that we're still excited to see unfold.""",Greg Abel will take over Berkshire Hathaway from Warren Buffett this week. Abel has already been managing all of Berkshire's noninsurance businesses since 2018. Buffett will remain chairman and plans to continue coming into the office each day to help spot new investments.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126255617,imgsize-737246,width-400,resizemode-4/warren-buffett.jpg"

Other names in the mix include current Fed governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman, as well as BlackRock executive Rick Rieder, according to Bloomberg.Trump has sent mixed signals about his decision, at times saying he had narrowed the field to one candidate before later indicating he was still considering multiple options.Trump, a long-time critic of Powell, whom he appointed during his first term has repeatedly argued that the Federal Reserve should cut interest rates more aggressively to lower borrowing and mortgage costs.The central bank has lowered rates at its last three meetings, but policymakers signaled in December that only one rate cut is likely in 2026.","US President Donald Trump renewed his attack on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, saying he would ""love to fire him"" Trump said he had come close to seeking Powell’s removal in July but backed off after financial markets reacted negatively.

The United States remains the top debtor of Taiwan banks for the 41st straight quarter. This means the U.S. owes more money to Taiwanese banks than any other country. According to a report by Focus Taiwan, this trend has continued for more than ten years without any change at the top spot.Citing data released by the central bank, the report shows that the money Taiwanese banks have tied up in the US grew by $4.03 billion. This is an increase of 2.07% from the end of June. By the end of September, the total amount reached $198.896 billion. The report noted that Hsieh Jen-chun, who is the deputy head of the central bank's Department of Financial Inspection, said the growth happened because banks put more money into U.S. securities and lending.On the other hand, Luxembourg is now the second-largest debtor to Taiwan's banks. It took the second spot away from China. Exposure to Luxembourg rose by $2.72 billion to reach $50.77 billion at the end of September. Hsieh said the increase happened because Taiwanese banks put more funds into trust assets in that European country. This is the third quarter in a row that the money kept in Luxembourg has grown.China fell to the third spot on the list. Even though the money tied up in China rose by about $1.07 billion to reach $49.56 billion, it is now less than Luxembourg. Hsieh noted that exposure to China stays between $40 billion and $50 billion. He said that this is due to ""concerns about that country's economic outlook."" He also mentioned that there is ""caution over Taiwan's Financial Supervisory Commission restrictions on lending and investments in China. ""Total international claims by Taiwanese banks also went up. These claims include things like loans, investments, and deposits. They rose by 3.48% from the previous quarter to reach $670.8 billion. This growth comes from more lending to the global nonbank private sector.Australia is the fourth-largest debtor with $42.14 billion. Other major nations on the list are Japan, Hong Kong, the United Kingdom, Singapore, France, and Vietnam. The top 10 debtor nations together account for $496.0 billion.

Its inclusion on the US critical minerals list has also added to investor interest.The white metal later slipped 1.3% to $78.12 per ounce as investors booked profits.""A combination of profit-taking and seemingly productive talks between Trump and Zelenskyy regarding a potential peace deal have put gold, silver on the back foot,"" KCM trade chief market analyst Tim Waterer told Reuters.Gold prices eased slightly after scaling fresh highs in the previous session.Spot gold slipped 0.1% to $4,527.79 per ounce by 1152 GMT on December 28, having touched a record $4,549.71 earlier. US gold futures for February delivery were steady at $4,553.10 an ounce.Gold has been lifted by a mix of factors, including US Federal Reserve interest rate cuts and bets on further easing, geopolitical tensions, sustained buying by central banks seeking to diversify away from US securities and the dollar, and rising holdings in exchange-traded funds. Traders continue to price in two US rate cuts next year, a backdrop that tends to favour non-yielding assets. The US dollar hovered near the two-month lows reached last Wednesday, offering some support to bullion, which has enjoyed a strong rally in 2025, climbing 72% so far.Geopolitical developments also remained in focus.US President Donald Trump said on Sunday that he and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy were “getting a lot closer, maybe very close” to an agreement to end the war in Ukraine.Among other precious metals, spot platinum slipped 0.8% to $2,429.10 an ounce after earlier rising to a record $2,478.50, while palladium edged up 0.1% to $2,003.83 an ounce.","Silver's rally extended gains for the sixth straight session, surging 6% to touch a lifetime high of Rs 2,54,174 per kilogram.

Attention is pinned on the minutes of the Fed’s December policy meeting, which is due for release on Tuesday. Meanwhile, recent strength in precious metals also showed signs of easing.In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index traded at 25,944, adding 125 points or 0.49%. Japan's Nikkei was down over 200 points to 50,550. Shanghai and Shenzhen added 0.4% and 0.19%, respectively. In Korea, Kospi gained 1.6%, to reach 4,197 at 8:40 AM IST.With only a handful of trading sessions left in the year, sentiment has been supported by expectations that US interest rates could be cut further, alongside confidence that the rally led by technology stocks has not yet run out of steam. Earlier this month, the Federal Reserve reduced borrowing costs as widely anticipated. However, it also struck a more measured tone, suggesting rates could remain unchanged at its next meeting, after two policymakers opposed a cut and one pushed for a deeper reduction.On the commodities front, gold and silver pulled back after surging to record levels in recent days. Both metals have benefited from strong buying interest, fuelled by expectations that lower interest rates would enhance their appeal, as well as their traditional role as safe-haven assets during times of uncertainty.

China's BYD poised to overtake Tesla in 2025 EV sales,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/chinas-byd-poised-to-overtake-tesla-in-2025-ev-sales/articleshow/126222415.cms,"Growing Chinese auto giant BYD stands poised to officially surpass Tesla as the world's biggest electric vehicle company in annual sales.The two groups are expected soon to publish their final figures for 2025, and based on sales data so far this year, there is almost no chance the American company led by Elon Musk will retain its leadership position.At the end of November, Shenzhen-based BYD, which also produces hybrid vehicles, had sold 2.07 million EVs so far in 2025.Tesla, for its part, had sold 1.22 million by the end of September.Tesla's September figures included a one-time boost in sales, to nearly half-a-million vehicles in a three-month period, before the expiration of a US tax credit for buyers of electric vehicles -- which ended under legislation backed by President Donald Trump, a climate change skeptic.But Tesla's sales in the coming quarter are expected to fall to 449,000, according to a FactSet analysis consensus. That would give Tesla about 1.65 million sales for all of 2025, a drop of 7.7 percent and well below the level BYD had attained by end November.Deutsche Bank, which projects just 405,000 Tesla EV sales during the fourth quarter, sees the company's sales down by around one-third in both North America and Europe, and by one-tenth in China.- Transition period -Industry watchers say it will take time for EV demand to reach a level of equilibrium in the United States following the elimination of the $7,500 US tax credit at the end of September 2025.Even prior to that, Tesla had seen sales struggle in key markets over CEO Musk's political support of Trump and other far-right politicians. Tesla has also faced rising EV competition from BYD and other Chinese companies and from European giants.""We believe Tesla will see some weakness on deliveries"" in the fourth quarter, said Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities.Sales of 420,000 would be ""good enough to show stable demand,"" with Wall Street ""laser focused on the autonomous chapter kicking off in 2026,"" Ives added, referring to plans for self-driving vehicles.Even as it has grown quickly, BYD has faced challenges in its home market.With profitability in China weighed down by price-wary consumers, the company has sought to strengthen its foothold in foreign markets.BYD is ""one of the pioneers to establish overseas production capacity and supply chains for EVs,"" Jing Yang, Director of Asia-Pacific Corporate Ratings at Fitch Ratings, told AFP.""Going forward, its geographical diversification is likely to help it to navigate an increasingly complicated global tariff environment,"" said Yang.Overseas rivals to BYD have balked at Chinese state subsidies and other state supports that have allowed the company to sell vehicles cheaply.Trump's predecessor Joe Biden imposed 100 percent tariffs on Chinese EV imports that could potentially go even higher under Trump. Europe has also imposed tariffs on Chinese imports, but BYD is building manufacturing capacity in Hungary.While the chance of Tesla reclaiming its global leadership in EVs looks uncertain, the American company is also potentially positioned for growth.Michaeli of TD Cowen sees autonomous technology playing an increasingly important role for Tesla, with breakthroughs in its ""full self-driving"" or ""FSD"" offerings potentially boosting sales.""As Tesla really begins to roll out eyes-off features and expand FSDs capability, if they do that successfully, that should generate more demand for their vehicles,"" Michaeli said.Musk has said the Cybercab, an autonomous robotaxi model, will begin production in April 2026. The company has also unveiled lower-priced versions of the Models 3 and Y that could boost sales.","Chinese auto giant BYD stands poised to officially surpass Tesla as the world's biggest electric vehicle company.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas.

What will Donald Trump as US President mean for Indian stock markets? Top advantages & disadvantages,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/what-will-donald-trump-as-us-president-mean-for-indian-stock-markets-top-advantages-disadvantages/articleshow/115005808.cms,"India stands to potentially benefit from this situation, with improved prospects for Foreign Portfolio Investment.

Benefits of Trump's Potential Victory for India

Indian export sectors could gain significant advantages if Trump wins, as higher tariffs on Chinese products may enhance competitiveness of Indian manufacturers in areas like auto parts, solar equipment, and chemical production in US markets.

Energy costs might decrease due to Trump's fossil fuel policies and expected slower Chinese economic growth. This could positively impact Indian oil companies like HPCL, BPCL, IOC, and gas distribution firms such as IGL and MGL.

Manufacturing and defense sectors could experience growth as Trump's emphasis on US industrial development may benefit companies operating in both countries, including ABB, Siemens, Cummins, Honeywell, GE T&D, and Hitachi Energy.

Resolution of international tensions under Trump could improve supply chain efficiency, aiding Indian businesses. His focus on strengthening US manufacturing and military capabilities could provide opportunities for Indian defense companies like Bharat Dynamics and HAL.

The business climate could improve with Trump's leadership, potentially benefiting Indian equity markets through reduced corporate taxation, fewer regulatory requirements, and business-friendly policies.

Disadvantages for India due to Trump's Return:

A Trump presidency could trigger inflation, affecting Indian businesses through higher interest rates and increased costs for US-sourced materials and equipment. Economic experts anticipate that his proposed policies on tariffs, deportation, and deficit spending could cause inflationary pressures, resulting in immediate price increases and wage adjustments.

Trump's economic policies could strengthen the US dollar and increase bond yields through tax reductions and fiscal measures. This would attract global capital to the US, potentially weakening emerging market currencies including the Indian rupee. A stronger dollar would increase India's import expenses, particularly for oil, leading to higher domestic inflation.

Despite possible initial market gains, Trump's policy uncertainties could create extended market instability. Previous data shows US markets outperformed Indian markets during his first term, with Nasdaq gaining 77% compared to Nifty's 38%.

Previous restrictions on H-1B visas under Trump affected Indian IT companies through increased rejection rates and costs. However, these companies have adapted by increasing local US hiring and green card holders, reducing their vulnerability to future immigration restrictions.

Trump has criticized India's trade policies and suggested reciprocal tariffs. His administration could pressure India to reduce trade barriers, affecting sectors like IT, pharmaceuticals, and textiles. However, his efforts to reduce Chinese manufacturing dependence could benefit India.

The anticipated increase in the US fiscal deficit under Trump could lead to global inflation and higher interest rates, creating challenges for emerging markets' monetary policies. While India's domestic-focused economy provides some buffer, a Harris victory would likely maintain current economic frameworks with minimal disruption.

US election results : Republican candidate Donald Trump is projected to defeat Democrat candidate Kamala Harris in the US presidential elections, as per the latest counting trends. Indian equity markets have responded positively to Trump’s potential win. But what will the long-term impact of Trump at the White House be for Indian stock markets?A Republican sweep might trigger a short-term upswing in stock markets, primarily due to gains in US equity markets, as per Emkay Global's analysis.The Chinese markets, however, are expected to face heightened volatility and uncertainty during this period.India appears to be among the primary beneficiaries of Trump's presidency, particularly concerning economic and foreign policy matters. As Nomura's Sonal Verma states, ""We see India as a relative beneficiary, due to its domestic demand-driven growth model and benefits from lower commodity prices, supply chain shifts and on foreign policy.""The advantages India stands to gain from the current supply chain reorganisation, as companies reduce their dependence on China during Trump's administration, are likely to outweigh any potential challenges related to trade and immigration policies, according to Verma.According to an ET analysis, India stands to potentially benefit from this situation, with improved prospects for Foreign Portfolio Investment positioning and increased capital flows, according to the brokerage firm's assessment.

(AI image)

DA Hike Calculator: How much will the take home salary increase?

To understand the impact of this 3% DA hike, let's consider an example:

Assuming a central government employee has a basic pay of Rs 46,200, their previous dearness allowance at 50% was Rs 23,100. With the DA now at 53%, their dearness allowance will increase to Rs 24,486.

This means they will receive an additional Rs 1,386 (Rs 24,486 - Rs 23,100) in DA from October. As the DA hike is effective from July 1, 2024, they will also receive arrears for the last three months.

DR Hike Calculator: How much will the pension increase?

If a central government pensioner receives a basic pension of Rs 50,400 per month, at the previous 50% DR, they were getting Rs 25,200.

With the DR now at 53%, they will receive Rs 26,712 monthly as dearness relief. This means their pension will increase by Rs 1,512 per month.

DA hike calculator : PM Narendra Modi-led Union Cabinet has approved a 3% increase in the dearness allowance (DA) for central government employees on October 16, 2024. Additionally, the dearness relief (DR) for central government pensioners has also been raised by 3%. As a result of this latest hike, the DA and DR now stand at 53% for both central government employees and pensioners respectively. This decision is set to benefit over 1 crore individuals.The dearness allowance, a component of the salary for government employees and pensioners, has been increased to 53%. This rise in DA will lead to an increase in the take-home salary of central government employees starting from October 2024.The effective date for the increased DA and DR is July 1, 2024. The central government typically revises these allowances twice a year, in January and July, with official announcements being made at a later date. Consequently, the DA/DR hike is implemented retrospectively from the cut-off date of July 1, 2024.Also Read | Dearness allowance hiked!

An enhancement of capex by 25% to Rs 14 lakh crore is part of the suggestions.The proposals come at a time when urban demand is seen to be weak, while companies such as HUL and Nestle are acknowledging a pickup in rural demand. Given the impact on the overall spending and difficulty in tracking the use of vouchers, the recommendation may be trashed by govt. In the past, the Centre considered an increase in PM-KISAN dole being enhanced from Rs 6,000 to Rs 8,000 annually, but it did not receive political clearance.In its tax proposals, CII has backed a three-slab GST structure, which includes petroleum, electricity and real estate and speed up resolution of disputes, while making the legislation simpler.Both Ficci and CII have also flagged their concerns over the complex tax deducted at source and tax collected at source structures and pointed to the need to revisit the multiple rates prescribed by tax authorities.Ficci has also recommended that reimbursement of day care expenses should be exempted from perquisite taxation. It has also suggested that there should be binding timelines for tax officials, a move that was proposed on the charter for taxpayers that released several years ago but has not been acted upon.CII has also laid out an ambitious roadmap for disinvestment, which is on the backburner and also reviving the asset monetisation pipeline, arguing that the two initiatives can help generate funds to meet the requirements of higher spending.","Industry lobby group CII has proposed that the Centre issue "" consumption vouchers "" to citizens in the lower income group.

Fed's Powell: Will not quit even if asked by Trump,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/federal-reserve-chair-jerome-powell-says-he-will-not-quit-even-if-asked-by-trump/articleshow/115068042.cms,"Federal Reserve Board Chairman Jerome Powell speaks during a news conference.

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell made clear he’s ready to defend the US central bank from political pressure following the re-election of Donald Trump , saying he wouldn’t resign if asked and insisting the incoming president doesn’t have the power to fire him or other senior Fed leaders.“No,” Powell said firmly on Thursday, when asked whether he would step aside if Trump asked for his resignation.During a press conference following the Fed’s two-day policy meeting, Powell said repeatedly that Trump — who explored firing the Fed chief during his first term in the White House — lacks the legal authority to demote or remove the chair or other senior Fed officials in Washington.“What Powell is saying, in making the forceful statement that no one can be demoted, is that the Fed’s leadership is all in this together,” said Peter Conti-Brown, a professor and Fed historian at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. “I see this as Powell’s declaration that the president-elect is going to have his say on shaping the Federal Reserve, but not until there are vacancies to be filled.”Powell’s remarks were striking as he worked hard to dodge every other politically-charged question lobbed at him from reporters. He strictly avoided speculating on what policies might emerge from the incoming administration. But he readily weighed in when the matter involved protecting the institution he’s served since 2012.“He’s a firm believer in the importance of Fed independence, and quitting voluntarily due to criticism from a president would show that the Fed isn’t independent,” Ian Katz, managing director at Capital Alpha Partners, wrote in a note to clients.The comments, just two days after Trump’s re-election, portend the power struggle that may lie ahead between the central bank and a president who insists he should have a say on interest-rate policy.Trump, who won Tuesday’s election by an unexpectedly large margin, has often blasted Powell. Though Trump appointed him to the chair in 2018, he then quickly pivoted to publicly urging him to stop raising rates later in the year.Staunch InstitutionalistPowell, a staunch institutionalist reared among Washington’s elite, has often spoken about the importance of central bank independence. In an interview earlier this year, he cast his desire to serve out his full term as a part of that.Trump, for his part, has backed away from some of his more provocative statements about how much a president should influence the central bank. He told Bloomberg in June that he’d let Powell serve out his current term, which ends in 2026. But he’s also said a president should be allowed to at least make suggestions on policy.One potential target for the Trump administration is Vice Chair for Supervision Michael Barr, the Fed’s top banking regulator who Republicans have repeatedly criticized.Speaking later Thursday on Bloomberg Television, Republican Senator Bill Hagerty, a leading contender to join Trump’s cabinet, said “everything should be on the table” when it comes to considering Barr’s position.“I would look at any legal option that we might have to make a change there,” he said.Ultimately, any attempt at firing or demoting Powell or his colleagues would probably face a battle in the courts. Many legal scholars have maintained that the president likely doesn’t have the authority to fire the central bank chair, but there could be a legal pathway for demoting the vice chair for supervision, some say.Rate CutThe Fed, meantime, delivered a quarter-point interest-rate cut on Thursday — the second-straight reduction. While the Fed is expected to lower rates further in the coming months, investors and economists have pared back expectations for how low rates will fall this cutting cycle, partly in response to Trump’s election.Trump has promised to deploy more aggressive tariffs, crack down on immigration and extend tax cuts — policies that could put upward pressure on prices and long-term interest rates.Powell reiterated that future policy decisions will depend on incoming economic data, and the Fed won’t try to anticipate fiscal or trade policy.“We don’t know what the timing and substance of any policy changes will be,” Powell said. “We therefore don’t know what the effects on the economy would be, specifically whether and to what extent those policies would matter for the achievement of our goal variables: maximum employment and price stability.”The Fed chair committed to additional rate cuts in the future but not a timeline, said Lindsey Piegza, chief economist for Stifel Financial Corp. He left “the door open for a potential policy pause at that December meeting should the data remain as solid as it has and should inflation remain as sticky as it has.”Powell noted the economy has been stronger than expected, and also pointed to a higher-than-hoped September inflation reading.Though he insisted all options remain on the table, the comments opened the possibility the Fed might take a pause from lowering rates at its December gathering — the final meeting of the year.“We’ll make a decision as we get to December,” Powell said, adding that policymakers will get more data before then.","Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell says he won't resign if asked. He says the incoming president doesn't have the power to fire him or other senior Fed leaders. The Fed delivered a quarter-point interest-rate cut on Thursday.

Railway Budget 2024 : The government has wavered little in its efforts to spur a modernisation of railways in the country, pivoting on technology, to support the country’s economic ambitions. In line with expectations, Union Budget 2024-25 set the capex for railways at a record Rs 2.65 lakh crore, marking yet another year of successive increase in outlay. That takes forward the past policies and the government’s vision, which have paved the way for modernisation of the transport behemoth.In earlier decades, the government had focused on laying tracks on new routes, electrification and incremental rolling stock capacity addition. That was the need of the hour back then and has helped set up the base for a larger transformation.For instance, the massive Dedicated Freight Corridor ( DFC ) as well as locomotive factories at Marhaura and Madhepura in Bihar were conceptualised over a decade ago and we are seeing their completion now.More recently, the focus has shifted to modernisation—of rolling stock and safety systems, among other aspects.This year, emphasis has also been laid on the railways’ crucial role in industrial development. Commodity-specific corridors have been planned in eastern India and impetus given to port connectivity. Vande Bharat and technology-led upgrades in rolling stock remain in focus. Safety has been prioritised through budgetary allocations for the anti-collision systemKavach . That said, there are other cogs in the wheel that demand attention from a long-term perspective.First, the target for the Operating Ratio, the crucial efficiency gauge, has been set at 98.22% for 2024-25, compared with 98.65% in 2023-24. This reflects an imminent need for operational transformation. An effective overhaul of the world’s fourth-largest rail network will take many years and thus we need to start focusing on improving efficiency and reducing costs now.DFC is almost entirely operational and will be complete over the next few months. To ensure the project achieves its twin goals of reducing logistics costs and enhancing freight efficiency, railways need to attract more cargo on the corridor. This will help increase the rail coefficient and make the railways’ approach more market-oriented, which will in turn aid future corridors.A revamp of railway stations is on track, with sufficient funds dedicated to this end. But even though new coaches and wagons are increasingly being added to meet footfalls, the stations and passenger trains themselves remain synonymous with chaos.Just as safety, comfort and convenience have been prioritised, there is a need for solutions to address the capacity and demand challenges. As a first step, the government could target development of new stations and setting up of new coach production units.As a leading freight mover, Indian Railways carried a record 1,588 MT cargo in fiscal 2024, up from 1,095 MT in fiscal 2015. It accounts for 26% of the cargo moved in the country—by no means an easy feat. The railways aims to take this volume to 3,000 MT by 2030, which would require a 11% CAGR against the around 4.2% witnessed over the last 10 years. As per a report by TERI and Shakti Foundation, from carrying about 62% of freight traffic in 1990-91, Indian Railways’ share has declined to ~27% in 2014-15. This has been due to the expanding road network, cost competitiveness over railways, and door-to-door service. Thus, commencing the cycle of increasing the rail share again is commendable.DFCs, a high-capacity track network, high-power locomotives and improvement in wagon designs have set the ball rolling for larger capacity, faster freight trains that deliver better efficiency.Yet, achieving exponential growth is a tall ask given the current dynamics. Possibly, similar challenges might apply to other goals the railways might have for 2047.To be fair, despite its scale and complexity, Indian Railways has been able to achieve diverse developments at commendable speed.But the track ahead is long and it is time to start discussing the reinvention of the institutional set-up.Indian Railways sees substantial private sector involvement in the form of vendors and contractors. Policymakers could start mulling extreme options such as parallel privately-owned and operated railway infrastructure, coupled with centralised planning and an evolved role for the railways. This will need a robust policy framework from the Government of India.The time is perhaps also ripe to bring user charge and asset monetisation-driven segments for passengers as well as cargo to the discussion table. Globally, the separation of infrastructure and operations in railways has delivered mixed results, for example in the United Kingdom. The model should be analysed and revisited to understand its potential relevance in the Indian context.The key would be to retrace our steps and align our long-term goals to identify not just incremental changes but also ways to explore bold and path-breaking alternatives that put Indian Railways on a smooth track and bring it up to speed.","Union Budget 2024-25 set the capex for railways at a record Rs 2.65 lakh crore.

Budget 2024 capital gains tax changes: The Narendra Modi government is considering suggestions for tweaks in the new long term capital gains tax regime that was announced by FM Nirmala Sitharaman in Union Budget 2024.The July 23 budget reduced the LTCG tax on property from 20% to 12.5%. The indexation benefit, which allowed taxpayers to adjust the acquisition cost for inflation before calculating capital gains and thus reduce their tax liability, is proposed to be eliminated for properties purchased on or after April 1, 2001.The government publishes the Cost Inflation Index (CII) annually for this calculation.India Inc is appealing to the government for a gradual shift to the long-term capital gains tax regime proposed in the FY25 budget, which aims to eliminate indexation benefits for property, gold, and other unlisted assets.According to an ET report by Deepshikha Sikarwar, the industry is suggesting alternatives such as a higher tax rate with indexation or a lower rate of 12.5% without indexation, as well as some form of grandfathering for ancestral properties.The finance ministry is currently reviewing these proposals and will discuss them with the Prime Minister's Office.

Budget 2024 for manufacturing sector : The recent Union Budget has struck a balance between fiscal consolidation and stimulating economic growth. While the middle class has been offered tax relief, the government's primary focus remains on judicious spending to maximize economic impact. The budget's core themes are employment, skilling, MSME development, and support for the middle class.Largely focus has remained intact on spending money judiciously to ensure that each penny spent creates a ripple effect in the entire economic landscape.Although at first glance, manufacturing might appear to have taken a backseat, a deeper analysis reveals a multifaceted approach to bolstering the sector. Initiatives like employment-linked benefits and internship programs, while primarily aimed at job creation and skill development, indirectly benefit manufacturing companies by expanding the talent pool.Extensive focus on the MSME manufacturing units by way of extending term loan facility for purchase of machinery and equipment without collateral or third-party guarantee, would help companies in augmenting their capital base/ capacity and strengthen the very foundation of the manufacturing ecosystem in the country. Development of a new credit-assessment model by Public Sector Banks to assess MSME credit shall provide much needed regulatory relief to the units.With respect to the large manufacturing entities, while there is no direct fiscal/ tax incentive introduced in this budget, some support has been provided with an extensive focus on development of ‘industrial parks’ in nearly 100 cities under the ‘plug and play’ model. Reforms proposed with respect to land administration, planning and management, shall also ease out acquisition related difficulties often faced by entrepreneurs/ business houses in acquiring lands for manufacturing set-ups.Targeted Customs duty interventions like, rationalization of Customs duty provisions in Mobile phone manufacturing setups, extension of Customs duty exemption on import of capital goods for manufacturing of solar cells and panels, full Customs duty exemption on import of 25 critical minerals,, shall provide the required impetus for enhancing domestic manufacturing environment.Governments’ focus on formulating an Economic Policy Framework to set the scope for next-gen reforms in the country, has a target to improve the productivity of factors of production, namely, land, labour, capital, entrepreneurship and technology. This shall pave the way for enabling achievement of a target of 25% manufacturing sector contribution to the nation’s GDP over the course of next 7-10 years.While the overall outlook is positive, the extension of tax benefits under Section 115BAB for manufacturing entities and the absence of new PLI schemes are notable omissions.The country’s manufacturing base is expanding as is reflective from the continuously increasing tax collections and expanding Purchasing Manager’s Index. It would be pertinent to see how the ground realities evolve vis-à-vis the vision envisaged, in the upcoming Financial Year.","While the overall outlook is positive, the extension of tax benefits under Section 115BAB for manufacturing entities and the absence of new PLI schemes are notable omissions.

Budget 2024: Armed with the vision to propel India to become a developed country by 2047, the Union Budget 2024 aims to focus largely towards strengthening the Make in India initiative and ease of doing business thereby providing the required stimulus to the manufacturing sector and enabling large scale job creation.On the Indirect tax front, the industry welcomes the much-needed announcement for a comprehensive review of the rate structure under Customs enabling ease in product classification and dispute reduction. The proposal of lowering of Customs duty on a plethora of raw materials and products including solar cells, critical minerals and bullion are encouraging measures. The rationale behind such reduction clearly indicates support towards domestic manufacturing, deepening value addition and supporting targets in reducing carbon footprint.Relevant amendments under the Customs law have been made to provide increased time limits for re-imports and re-exports to enhance competitiveness of the fledgling MRO sector. The government has extended significant duty reduction and exemption benefits to the healthcare and electronics sectors, continuing the impetus of incentives provided under the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme.Since their introduction in March 2020, the PLI schemes have indeed supported in revitalizing the manufacturing sector and strengthening the necessary supply chains. The success achieved in the mobile manufacturing sector has now enabled the Government to reduce customs duties on mobile phones and components, signalling a mature environment. The Budget proposals aim at reproducing similar outcomes for semiconductor and pharmaceutical industry by increasing the budgetary allocation.Buoyed by the increasing revenue collection under GST signalling a shift towards a mature tax regime, this Budget has harmonized the timeframes for the issuance of demand notices and adjudication orders for cases involving fraud, suppression or otherwise. Significant amendments to the GST legislations have been introduced reflecting the recommendations proposed by the GST Council such as regularizing non-levy of GST due to general practice which may turn out to be a breather for certain impacted industries reeling under huge tax demands.The Insurance sector has been provided much relief through the GST council recommendations which have been cemented in the present budget thereby ending long standing disputes on their business practices.The Government's efforts to push forward with its reform agenda are evident as plans to incentivize states for their business reform actions plans and digitalization through the Jan Vishwas Bill 2.0 is proposed. Further, setting up of e-commerce export hubs is envisaged to facilitate easier access to international markets for domestic players.The recent implementation of Budget proposals allows the government to maintain momentum in its reform agenda. These policy measures implicitly reaffirm the significance of India Inc as a crucial element in the development of infrastructure. However, there are still some expectations required to be met to march towards a Viksit Bharat 2047.","Union Budget 2024 aims to focus largely towards strengthening the Make in India initiative.

Budget 2024 : Real estate, a significant contributor to employment generation, has received a fair bit of attention in Budget 2024-25. Recent years have seen the sector transform rapidly, driven by factors such as favourable government policies, Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016, strong economic growth and changing consumer preferences.Added to that, the budgetary focus on job creation, skilling and employment-linked incentives, infrastructure, urban development, rural connectivity, digitalisation and land-related norms, all dovetail to promote growth of the sector.Launched in June 2015, the PMAY aims to provide affordable housing to all eligible beneficiaries. The budget unveiled PMAY Urban 2.0, under which the housing needs of 1 crore urban poor and middle class will be addressed with an investment of Rs 10 lakh crore.The central government’s additional Rs 2.2 lakh crore injection in the next 5 years to make housing more affordable has the potential to revitalise the affordable housing market.Such an approach can play an important role in realising the government's vision of Housing for All and push growth and development. Hence, the significant investment under PMAY Urban 2.0 is expected to alleviate urban housing deficits, spurring construction and economic growth.Steps to introduce technological reforms within the regulatory framework for land, such as digitalisation or GIS mapping of land records, will improve transparency.Rationalisation of stamp duty across states will also be critical to bring in uniformity and initiate land-related reforms such as urban planning, usage and building bylaws.These are steps in the right direction and will boost growth. Moreover, they will improve the ease of property transactions and strengthen municipal finances through increased property taxes. Rationalization of stamp duty with an emphasis on women homebuyers may boost home-buyer sentiment in major cities, too.The budget has also given ample attention to urban and rural development, with rental housing for industrial workers through the public private partnership model, interest subsidies for rental housing, and transit-oriented developments.The proposal to develop investment-ready plug-and-play industrial parks in 100 cities may attract industrial investment, leading to increased demand for industrial real estate and support the growth of ancillary services and residential developments in these regions.Initiatives for industrial parks and rental housing for industrial workers align with the country’s manufacturing goals and addresses worker accommodation needs.These steps are expected to promote industrial growth and stability in labour-intensive sectors, while also creating new opportunities for real estate developers specialising in rental and affordable housing.The changes in long-term capital gains (LTCG) tax, however, have evoked a mixed reaction. The government lowered the long-term capital gains tax from 20% to 12.5%, which is a welcome step. However, this came with the removal of the indexation benefit.The changes could encourage more liquidity in property transactions and potentially increase the effective tax burden depending on the property’s acquisition date.The launch of Phase IV of the PM Gram Sadak Yojana in 25,000 rural habitations will improve connectivity in rural areas, promoting rural development and making these regions more accessible for investment. The primary objective of PMGSY is to build robust, all-weather roads in rural habitations. This initiative focuses on enhancing connectivity and supporting economic development in rural areas.In essence, the budget is geared towards stimulating growth and investment in the real estate sector , fostering a more transparent and investor-friendly environment, and contributing to overall development. It aims to create a balanced and inclusive growth environment by addressing the needs of various segments, including affordable housing, industrial workers and urban infrastructure.The effectiveness of the initiatives, however, hinges on their implementation and continued support of complementary reforms.",The central government’s additional Rs 2.2 lakh crore injection in the next 5 years to make housing more affordable has the potential to revitalise the affordable housing market.

New Budget 2024 rule: Why Income Tax Department is likely to issue a huge number of tax notices this month,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/new-budget-2024-rule-why-income-tax-department-is-likely-to-issue-a-huge-number-of-tax-notices-this-month/articleshow/112186079.cms,"Taxing Times

Income Tax Notice on the way? The Income Tax Department is gearing up to send out a large number of notices in the coming month, as there are concerns that many taxpayers might escape the tax net due to the impending implementation of the new reassessment law on September 1, 2024.According to the amended regulation announced in Budget 2024 , the tax authorities can only go back a maximum of five years to reassess a taxpayer's records if the escaped income is at least Rs 50 lakh, and three years for an amount less than Rs 50 lakh.Previously, they could reassess cases up to 10 years old.According to an ET report, tax officials are now faced with the challenge of compiling and corroborating data on tax and income mismatches for the financial years 2013-14 to 2017-18 within the next few weeks, as these years will become time-barred for reassessment from September 1, 2024.The I-T department relies on information from various sources, such as banks, property registrars, and search findings from the investigation wing, to build reassessment cases.A tax officers' body has raised concerns about the feasibility of issuing notices under Section 148 (or 148A) in a large number of cases within a single month, given the overburdened nature of the jurisdictional assessing officers and the time-consuming process of obtaining sanction from the chief commissioner, who is the specified authority for such notices.Moreover, the law provides taxpayers with the right to explain their position before reassessment orders are finalized, a process that most believe cannot be completed by the end of August.Also Read | ITR refund status for FY 2023-24: How to check income tax refund status online - here’s a step-by-step guide for incometax.gov.in & NSDL websites The Central Board of Direct Taxes ( CBDT ) has been urged by its officers to postpone the effective date of the proposed amendment. However, this suggestion is unlikely to be well-received by corporations and high net worth individuals.""Capping the reassessment period at five years was a great decision as it would reduce hassles and litigation. But if the department fears there could be a genuine loss of revenue as it may not be possible to wrap up several matters by August 31, the government can think of strict parameters where time-bound cases can be selectively reopened - based on trails of steps taken in identifying escaped income,"" said Mitil Chokshi, partner at CA firm Chokshi & Chokshi.""Taxpayers may expect a rush of reassessment notices in August 2024. These notices are likely to be for the AYs 2018-19 and prior to that. It is pertinent to note that the Bombay High Court in a recent ruling in a case of Hexaware Technologies has taken a view on a proviso introduced in 2021, which can be interpreted to mean that AY 2017-18 (and prior years) got time barred on March 31, 2024. These reassessment notices (for AYs 2017-18 and prior) are likely to rake up new interpretation issues in the already muddled reassessment provisions,"" said Ashish Mehta, partner at law firm Khaitan & Co.The current situation is similar to the conflict between the Income Tax office and taxpayers in 2021. The reassessment law was amended in April 2021, allowing the tax office to reopen 10-year-old tax returns if the total undisclosed income exceeded Rs 50 lakh and reassess 4-year-old matters if the amount was less than Rs 50 lakh.Also Read | Latest NPS rules 2024: How much tax will you save with new NPS contribution benefit under new regime after Budget 2024? However, this change led to over 10,000 writ petitions being filed by companies, arguing that they were not given sufficient time to explain and that the notices were issued without considering the carve-out that cases which couldn't be reopened earlier couldn't be reassessed under the new law.The Supreme Court invoked its extraordinary powers under Article 142 of the Constitution on May 4, 2022, to uphold all reassessment notices issued after March 31, 2021. However, the court left room for judicial proceedings based on the merits of each case, and several such matters are currently pending before the court.","The Income Tax Department is gearing up to send out a large number of notices in the coming month.

How NPS will increase tax savings

NPS and EPF: Overlapping services

What is NPS Vatsalaya?

Latest NPS rules, news: In the Union Budget 2024 speech, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced two new initiatives with regard to National Pension Scheme (NPS) - extension of NPS 14% employer contribution benefits to private setcor and the intended launch of NPS Vatsalya.Budget 2024 announced the hiking of the tax deduction limit on private sector employers’ contributions to NPS from 10% to 14% of employees’ basic salaries, bringing it at par with the provisions available for government employees.Sriram Iyer, CEO, HDFC Pension Management told ET that with this move the “ground rules have been harmonised among government and non-government employees, which is a positive step.”Effectively, this means that now, private-sector employees can choose to reduce the taxable portion of employers’ contribution to their NPS corpus, thereby paying less tax and leaving greater funds in their pension deposits.“Employees will benefit from tax savings . More importantly, the 40% increase in contribution will have a significant impact on the terminal value of the retirement corpus,” remarked Iyer. The extended savings will “help in retirement planning, working as an option that is at par with the Provident Fund,” Dinesh Rohira, CEO & Founder, 5nance.com was quoted as saying.Moreover, the endeavour aims to increase NPS penetration by increasing tax incentives for the private sector, providing them a social security-cushion post-retirement.The scheme’s motive to widen the NPS subscriber base may not prove to be flawlessly effective, however. This is explained by Agrees Mrin Agarwal, Founder, Finsafe India: “While it’s good that the limit has been raised, it may not increase adoption as employees need to be educated in a big way. Also, the benefit is only for the salaried opting for the new tax regime,” she says.The mandatory contribution to the EPF, too, threatens to relegate the provisions of NPS under the umbrella of near-superfluity. This sentiment is echoed by Varun Sahay, a software engineer in a Delhi-based IT company: “When 12% of my salary is already deducted for the EPF, why should I put in more in the NPS and cut my take-home pay?”Rohira feels otherwise. “There’s no competition between the NPS and EPF as employees can contribute to both and build a 3-4 times bigger corpus while earning 3-4% higher returns via marketlinked options in the NPS,” he counters.Also Check | New Tax Regime 2023 vs 2024 After Budget: How Much Income Tax Will Salaried Taxpayers Save & How Do New Tax Slabs Compare To Old Regime? Top 10 Points You Must Know To jumpstart retirement savings for children, a new initiative called NPS Vatsalya has been unveiled in the Budget. This scheme allows parents and guardians to contribute to a minor's account, which can be converted into a regular NPS account once the child reaches adulthood.""It provides a very long duration for reaping the compounding benefits and accumulating a huge bounty at a later age. This can be a good way to plan a better future for kids who may not opt for a service segment in the future,"" says Rohira. Sriram Iyer agrees, stating, ""It’s a good move to help the child start his retirement journey. Even if a parent starts when the child is 10 years old, by the time he starts working, it can be a solid foundation for the compounding journey after that.""However, some experts question the utility of a product with such a long lock-in period, especially when parents cannot use the funds for essential goals like their child’s education amidst soaring education costs of 11-12%.""Parents are struggling to save for their own retirement, so it might be a bit of a stretch to expect them to save for their kids’ retirement. The need of the hour is a market-linked product that allows withdrawals only for the child’s education,"" says Mrin Agarwal, Founder of Finsafe India.Also Read | Latest NPS rules 2024: How much tax will you save with new NPS contribution benefit under new regime after Budget 2024? Though the NPS permits partial withdrawals, it allows only 25% of the corpus after three years of joining, and this can be done only three times during the entire tenure. A premature exit before 60 years with 100% withdrawal is only possible if the corpus is less than Rs.2.5 lakh, an amount insufficient for most children's goals.""In its current form, there won’t be any uptake,"" asserts Agarwal. Rohira concurs, ""It’s a vanilla product with a lock-in, which does not make it very attractive and it may not take off. However, the government may optimise it and introduce new features later."" Iyer adds, ""This is just a start and there may be more subscriber-friendly features as we take it to the market. The regulator is proactive and open to feedback.""","Budget 2024 announced the hiking of the tax deduction limit on private sector employers’ contributions to NPS from 10% to 14% of employees’ basic salaries.

Gold import duty cut: Why Indians may not find buying gold from Dubai as attractive post Budget 2024,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gold-import-duty-cut-why-indians-may-not-find-buying-gold-from-dubai-as-attractive-post-budget-2024/articleshow/112097671.cms,"Gold import duty cut: Joy Alukkas, chairman of Joy Alukkas Group, estimates that nearly 50% of their UAE business will shift to India.

Gold import duty cut in Budget 2024: The recent reduction in customs duty on gold imports in the Union Budget 2024 is expected to significantly impact the gold shopping habits of Indian consumers who frequently visit Dubai. Indian jewellers with stores in both India and the UAE believe that the narrowed duty differential will result in lower gold prices in India, making it less attractive for Indians to purchase gold in Dubai.The emirate had attracted gold-enthusiast Indians following a steep rise in customs duty in India in July 2022. In the fiscal 2024-25 budget, the duty on gold imports was more than halved.The duty cut is also expected to boost gold jewellery production in India, particularly the popular 'Kolkatti' jewellery from Kolkata, which is favored by Indian expats in Dubai and tourists from various countries. This move will encourage gold artisans to create new designs in both heavyweight and lightweight jewellery, attracting consumers to purchase gold from India.According to an ET report, Joy Alukkas, chairman of Joy Alukkas Group , estimates that nearly 50% of their UAE business will shift to India as Indian tourists who previously bought jewellery in Dubai will now prefer to shop in India. However, Indian expats living in Dubai and other customers may continue to buy from the UAE.Also Read | Gold losing sheen? Government cuts gold bond issuance target as investors look at better alternatives Rajiv Popley, director at Popley & Sons, believes that the perception of overseas gold being cheaper than in India is merely a mindset. He points out that the labour cost is significantly lower in India, and with the introduction of mandatory hallmarking and HUID numbers, the purity of gold in India is no longer a concern.Furthermore, NRIs in Dubai do not receive VAT refunds, and Indians travelling abroad only receive about 60% of the VAT back on their gold purchases. Gold trade analyst Bhargav Baidya suggests that the 1% duty differential between gold jewellery in India and Dubai will be offset by Indian jewellers offering discounts to retain and attract customers.Saurabh Gadgil, chairman of PNG Jewellers, notes that Indian import duty is now on par with the US, allowing Indian jewellers to offer competitive prices compared to other countries worldwide. The reduced customs duty is expected to make gold purchases in India more attractive and convenient for Indian consumers, potentially leading to a significant shift in their gold shopping preferences.","The reduction in customs duty on gold imports in the Union Budget 2024 is expected to significantly impact the gold shopping habits of Indian consumers.

Gold Bonds losing sheen

Gold losing sheen? The government has reduced its target for issuing gold bonds in the financial year 2024-25 by 38% compared to the previous interim budget goal, according to a senior official. The revised target stands at Rs 18,500 crore, down from Rs 29,638 crore estimated in the interim budget and Rs 26,852 crore (revised estimate) in 2023-24.The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told ET ""The decision followed a reassessment of various factors, including investor demand, other investment products and uncertainties around the global economy, as the situation has changed since the interim budget in February.""After accounting for redemptions, the net issuances of sovereign gold bonds are now estimated at Rs 15,000 crore for this fiscal year, a significant decrease from the Rs 26,138 crore projected in the interim budget and Rs 25,352 crore in the revised estimate for 2023-24.Harish Galipelli, director at ILA Commodities India, attributed this shift to retail investors increasingly opting for equities in anticipation of better returns. He also noted that people are uncertain about the potential for further increases in gold prices in the short-to-medium term following a recent rally. Additionally, Galipelli pointed out that savings in rural areas have been impacted by retail inflation and other factors.The gold bond and gold monetisation schemes were introduced by the government in late 2015 to discourage the physical purchase of precious metals and reduce imports, thereby mitigating the negative impact on the current account deficit.The gross collection through these two schemes is now projected to be Rs 20,030 crore in 2024-25, compared to Rs 31,168 crore in the interim budget and Rs 28,240 crore (revised estimate) in the previous fiscal year. Similarly, the net collection is estimated at Rs 16,433 crore, down from Rs 27,571 crore in the interim budget and Rs 26,653 crore in the previous year. However, the estimates for the gold monetisation scheme remain unchanged from the interim budget level.Also Read | Budget 2024: Duty cuts on gold, silver, platinum, and diamonds to make jewellery more affordable The sovereign gold bond scheme targets investors who view gold as an investment, encouraging them to purchase paper gold instead of physical gold.On the other hand, the gold monetisation scheme aims to bring out idle gold held by households, temple trusts, and others to increase domestic supply. Both schemes were designed to curb gold imports, which, along with crude oil, have been significant contributors to India's current account deficit.

Besides, festivals in the quarter like Raksha Bandhan and Onam also fuelled some spending, reflected in the growth of food consumption which increased to 3.4% in Q3 from 2.1% in Q2.""The uptick in volume growth is attributed to staple categories - edible oils, packaged atta and spices - despite price growth.

'He’s an American badass': Vivek Ramaswamy explains why Trump won the US elections,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/hes-an-american-badass-vivek-ramaswamy-explains-why-trump-won-the-us-elections/articleshow/115034742.cms,"What is American Badass?

In the wake of Donald Trump ’s remarkable victory, Vivek Ramaswamy , a rising star in the Republican Party , has provided a compelling reason for his success: the former President is “an American badass .” In a recent statement, Ramaswamy celebrated Trump’s triumph, explaining that while many in the media misjudged the 45th President, his resilience and self-belief were key to his comeback.“Trump isn’t an ideologue or a policy wonk,” Ramaswamy said. “He’s an American badass. They tried to disqualify him, imprison him, and even kill him twice – none of it worked. They underestimated him, and by extension, they underestimated the American people.” Ramaswamy’s bold words reflect his deep admiration for Trump’s ability to defy the odds, particularly in a deeply polarized political climate. He credits Trump’s victory with embodying a spirit of American exceptionalism that resonates with millions of voters across the nation.For Ramaswamy, who has become a significant voice within the Republican Party through his outspoken criticism of ""corporate wokeness"" and his advocacy for free-market capitalism, Trump’s success is a testament to the broader appeal of a tough, unapologetic leadership style.Ramaswamy, who aligned himself with Trump during the election season, has become a key supporter of Trump’s economic agenda. His pro-business stance and strong opposition to what he deems ""left-wing overreach"" have earned him growing influence in Republican circles.However, Ramaswamy’s focus is on the strength of the American spirit that Trump represents. He sees Trump’s success as the embodiment of the nation’s resilience—a nation that, despite facing challenges.""He’s just like our nation in that way. We’ve always believed it was our manifest destiny to be exceptional, to be the greatest nation on Earth, to show the world what’s possible for humanity to achieve, even when other countries doubted us,"" Ramaswamy said.“Trump’s comeback is the American comeback,” Ramaswamy declared. “Our nation deserves a badass Commander-in-Chief right now—and that’s exactly what we got.”Ramaswamy’s words offer a sharp contrast to the more sombre reaction from Vice President Kamala Harris, who conceded defeat with a promise to continue fighting for progressive ideals. Speaking to a crowd at Howard University, Harris acknowledged Trump’s victory while vowing to keep fighting for women’s rights and against gun violence. She called the loss “not what we wanted,” but expressed hope that the “light of America’s promise” would continue to burn brightly despite the outcome.As Trump celebrates his historic victory, Ramaswamy’s influence continues to grow within the GOP, and many see him as a potential future leader. Trump himself has hinted that Ramaswamy may play a prominent role in the next administration, with speculation that he could be considered for a cabinet position to help further the president’s deregulatory agenda.For those familiar with WWE-era of the early 2000s the term ""American badass"" perfectly encapsulates Donald Trump's persona. The Undertaker (Mark Calaway) adopted a more rebellious, rough-around-the-edges biker look, complete with leather jackets, bandanas, and sunglasses. The persona was seen as a homage to Calaway home-state of Texas, a republican stronghold. This version of the Undertaker was tough, no-nonsense, and embodied the spirit of an American outlaw.Calaway, alongside other WWE stars like Hulk Hogan and Kane, have openly supported Trump.",Vivek Ramaswamy is a rising star in the Republican Party.

TOKYO: Nissan reported Thursday a loss for the latest fiscal quarter as its vehicle sales sank while costs and inventory ballooned, prompting the Japanese automaker to slash 9,000 jobs. Chief Executive Makoto Uchida said he was taking a 50 per cent pay cut to take responsibility for the dismal results, while promising that a turnaround was coming.Nissan Motor Corp announced a global workforce reduction of 9,000 people, or about 6 per cent of its more than 1,33,000 employees, as well as a plan to slash global production capacity by 20 per cent.Uchida declined to say which regions will be affected by the cuts or give specifics.For the latest quarter through September, Nissan racked up a 9.3 billion Yen (USD 60 million) loss, a reversal from the 190.7 billion Yen profit recorded the same quarter a year ago.Quarterly sales fell to 2.9 trillion Yen (USD 19 billion) from 3.1 trillion Yen.Uchida acknowledged Nissan didn't respond quickly or flexibly enough to global changes, including market tastes and soaring raw material costs.""I take this situation very seriously,"" he told reporters. ""Nissan will restructure its business to become leaner and more resilient.""Nissan models did not sell well in the US, one of the most lucrative auto markets in the world that's recently been dominated by Ford, Toyota and Tesla.All aspects of Nissan's operations and plans will be under review, Uchida said.Nissan, based in the port city of Yokohama, reported fiscal first half sales revenue of 5.98 trillion Yen (USD 39 billion), edging down 1 per cent from the more than 6 trillion Yen the same period last year.Its April to September profit totaled 19.2 billion Yen (USD 124 million), declining sharply from the 296.2 billion Yen earned over the six months last year.Nissan lowered its sales revenue forecast for the fiscal year through March 2025 to 12.7 trillion Yen (USD 82 billion) from an earlier projection for 14 trillion Yen (USD 91 billion).It did not give a net profit forecast, citing uncertainty. It promised to give a profit forecast as soon as possible. Earlier, Nissan was forecasting an annual profit of 300 billion Yen (USD 1.9 billion).Nissan now expects to sell 3.4 million vehicles around the world in the fiscal year ending in March 2025, down from an earlier projected 3.65 million vehicles. The new number is about the same that Nissan sold last fiscal year.Nissan said it's appointing a chief performance officer tasked with turnaround decision-making, who will begin his job next month.No dividends will be paid out, given the harsh results.","Nissan Motor Corp announced a global workforce reduction of 9,000 people.

Fredi9999: How a 'Trump whale' won $50m bet on US polls,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/fredi9999-how-a-trump-whale-won-50m-bet-on-us-polls/articleshow/115050162.cms,"Theo's bets proved highly successful as Trump won the election and performed strongly in swing states like Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin.

Why did Theo criticize US polls, and what did he suggest instead?

What are the implications of Theo’s success in prediction markets?

What is next for prediction markets after Theo’s win?

A mysterious figure in the world of crypto-based prediction markets, known as the “Trump whale,” has captured global attention after making nearly $50 million by betting on Donald Trump ’s 2024 presidential victory.Here is all you need to know about the ' Trump whale 'The “Trump whale” is a pseudonymous trader named Theo, a wealthy Frenchman and former banker with substantial experience in financial markets. He gained notoriety for making nearly $50 million by betting on Donald Trump’s victory in the 2024 US presidential election through the crypto-based platform Polymarket.Polymarket is a cryptocurrency-based prediction platform where traders buy “yes” or “no” shares based on the expected outcome of events. Theo placed over $30 million in bets on Polymarket using four anonymous accounts, including one known as “Fredi9999,” which became one of the most profitable accounts on the platform. His strategy involved betting on Trump winning both the presidency and the popular vote.Theo’s approach hinged on his skepticism of mainstream US polling. He believed that these polls overestimated Vice President Kamala Harris's support and underestimated Trump’s voter base due to phenomena like the “shy Trump voter effect.” This effect suggests that some Trump supporters might be unwilling to express their preference openly to pollsters. Theo’s analysis included using the ""neighbor poll"" method, where respondents are asked about their neighbors' voting intentions, which he argued was a better indicator of real support.Theo’s prediction was based on a detailed mathematical analysis of U.S. polling trends, informed by his background in banking and trading. He identified that Trump had overperformed in swing states in the past and believed similar trends would hold in 2024. He even commissioned private surveys to validate his assumptions, which reportedly provided ""mind-blowing"" data in Trump’s favor. Theo’s bets were thus not just guesses but data-driven gambles.Theo's bets proved highly successful as Trump won the election and performed strongly in swing states like Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin. Reports from Bloomberg and Polymarket data confirmed that Theo’s accounts accumulated profits of around $48 million, making him the most profitable user in Polymarket’s history. His total portfolio on the platform was valued at over $100 million post-election.Did Theo have a political motive? Despite the scale of his bets, Theo maintained that his primary goal was financial gain, not political advocacy. In his communications with The Wall Street Journal, he stated, “I have absolutely no political agenda.” This claim, however, was impossible to verify independently, and some analysts wondered whether his substantial wagers were purely for profit or if there were deeper motivations.Theo criticized US polls for being biased toward Democrats and producing results that, in his view, misrepresented voter sentiment. He noted, “In France this is different!! The pollster credibility is more important: they want to be as close as possible to the actual results.” He argued that American pollsters should incorporate the neighbor poll method more widely to avoid missing hidden voter support.Theo’s success has sparked debates on the accuracy and reliability of traditional polling versus prediction markets. His case demonstrated that prediction markets, which rapidly adjust to new data, could provide insights that outpace mainstream analyses. Polymarket's CEO pointed out that their platform’s user-based predictions were often more accurate than conventional forecasts, highlighting a potential shift in how election forecasting is perceived.The ""Trump whale"" saga may encourage more people to turn to prediction markets as a reliable gauge of public sentiment and outcomes, challenging the dominance of traditional polling methods. However, questions about transparency, regulation, and the motivations behind large, anonymous bets remain open, sparking further discussions on the role of such markets in the political landscape.(With inputs from agencies)",Theo is a wealthy Frenchman and former banker with substantial experience in financial markets.

Pro-crypto candidates win big as crypto firms pour $130 million in 2024 US elections,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/pro-crypto-candidates-win-big-as-crypto-firms-pour-130-million-into-2024-us-presidential-elections/articleshow/115047476.cms,"The 2024 US Presidential election proved to be a critical opportunity for crypto firms, which invested tens of millions of dollars to back candidates who supported more lenient regulations for the sector.American businessman, politician Bernardo Moreno who is a long time crypto enthusiast secured his win, thanks to a major boost of more than $130 million from the cryptocurrency industry.The push allowed Republican candidate Moreno to win the Ohio senate race, defeating Democrat Sherrod Brown, who chairs the influential Senate banking committee and has a strict call for crypto firms.According to a New York Times report, a massive fund was utilized by crypto firms to broadcast ads across Ohio, in an attempt to influence crucial congressional races.A super political action committee or PAC called Fairshake, along with two affiliated groups, Protect Progress and Defend American Jobs, spent approximately $135 million to support the candidates with a positive view for cryptocurrencies. This funding was backed by crypto companies Coinbase and Ripple, as well as the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, which has supported over 100 crypto startups.According to the experts, this effort was one of the most aggressive corporate spending sprees in modern political history, and it seems to have produced ground breaking returns.As per Stand With Crypto, a nonprofit organization that unites global crypto advocates, 261 candidates elected to the House of Representatives supported crypto, while 116 of the chosen candidates opposed it. Similarly, in the senate 17 pro crypto candidates and 12 anti crypto candidates were elected.It further showed that Tim Sheehy, a Republican candidate with a strong support for crypto, also secured his US Senate win from Montana defeating Jon Tester who has neutral views on the topic.Paul Grewal, chief legal officer for Coinbase said, ""The most important message from last night is that crypto wins,"" adding, ""We now have the most pro-crypto Congress in history,"" quoted the New York Times.The Biden administration spent years targeting crypto companies for securities law violations which the newly elected US President Donald Trump has promised to end and transform the United States.It is anticipated that with the arrival of pro crypto candidates in the government, a resolution could be offered to pass legislation that would withdraw the SEC.The SEC or the US Securities and Exchange Commission, is a government agency focused on protecting investors in crypto markets against cyber-related threats. It is the federal agency that has most aggressively taken legal action against crypto companies.","The 2024 US Presidential election proved to be a critical opportunity for crypto firms, which invested tens of millions of dollars to back candidates who supported more lenient regulations for the sector.

US stocks: S&P 500 sees best post-election day in its history,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-stocks-sp-500-sees-best-post-election-day-in-its-history/articleshow/115036758.cms,"The S&P 500 climbed 2.5% on bets the newly elected president will enact pro-growth policies that will boost Corporate America.

Stocks hit all-time highs, US yields jumped and the dollar saw its best day since 2022, with investors mapping out Donald Trump ’s return to presidency and the potential for Republicans to win both houses of Congress.The S&P 500 climbed 2.5% on bets the newly elected president will enact pro-growth policies that will boost Corporate America. The benchmark had its best post-Election Day in history, according to data compiled by Birinyi Associates Inc. and Bloomberg. A gauge of small caps rallied 5.8% amid speculation they will benefit from Trump’s protectionist stance, while wagers on lower taxes and reduced regulation lifted banks. Insurers focused on the Medicare market jumped on expectations the new government will pay higher rates to companies that provide private versions of the US health program for seniors.Wall Street ’s “fear gauge” — the VIX — tumbled the most since August. Almost 19 billion shares changed hands on US exchanges, 63% above the daily average in the past three months. The Dow Jones Transportation Average jumped to a fresh high after a three-year drought of records, finally confirming the strength of its industrial counterpart. The breakout is a bullish sign to followers of an investing framework known as Dow Theory that says synchronized gains in both gauges portend better times ahead for the broad market.“For now, investor sentiment is pro-growth, pro-deregulation, and pro-markets,” said David Bahnsen, chief investment officer at The Bahnsen Group. “There is also an assumption that M&A activity will pickup and that more tax cuts are coming or the existing ones will be extended. This creates a strong backdrop for stocks.”Treasury yields climbed across the curve, with the move led by longer-term bonds as traders slashed wagers on the scope of rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. Investors have doubled down on bets for policies such as tax cuts and tariffs that could trigger price pressures. The moves also signal worries that Trump’s proposals will fuel the budget deficit and spur higher bond supply.US 10-year yields advanced 17 basis points to 4.44%. A dollar gauge added 1.3%, with the yen leading losses in major currencies and the euro down 1.8%. The Mexican peso was almost flat after sinking as much as 3.5%. Bitcoin, viewed by many as a so-called Trump trade after he embraced digital assets during his campaign, hit a record high. Commodities came under pressure, with gold and copper tumbling. Oil edged lower.“The biggest takeaway from last night is that we received certainty that the market craves,” said Ryan Grabinski at Strategas. “This will allow both business and consumer confidence to improve. Attention now should shift to the Fed meeting tomorrow. The 10-year is approaching the 4.5% level, that’s the level risk assets ran into some trouble in the last 24 months.”The S&P 500 hovered near 5,930, notching its 48th all-time high this year. The Nasdaq 100 added 2.7%, hitting its first record since July. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 3.6%. A gauge of the “Magnificent Seven” megacaps also hit a record, led by Tesla Inc.’s 15% surge. Trump Media & Technology Group Corp. jumped 5.9%. In late hours, Qualcomm Inc, the world’s biggest seller of smartphone processors, gave a bullish sales forecast.With many investors braced for a prolonged period of uncertainty, simply gaining some clarity on the outcome is providing a sigh of relief, according to Keith Lerner at Truist Advisory Services Inc. He says the market currently appears more focused on the positive aspects of Trump’s agenda with less emphasis on the potential of tariffs and wider policy outcomes.“Markets are pricing in most of the positives today, though the backdrop is complex, and rates, deficit concerns, the potential for fewer Fed rate cuts, and tariffs could eventually provide a counterbalance to today’s upside price shock, he noted. “Still, the weight of the evidence in our work indicates the bull market still has some longevity left, and we are sticking with the primary market uptrend.”At Macquarie, Thierry Wizman says traders have to be mindful about pushing the “yield story much further.”“If there’s a surprise coming from Trump in the next few months (at least relative to hyped-up expectations), it will be about fiscal restraint — rather than fiscal irresponsibility. When the market realizes this, long-term UST yields could stabilize or decline.”To Mark Haefele at UBS Global Wealth Management, the bond selloff has gone too far. He expects the Fed to stay on a path toward lower rates.Fed officials are widely expected to lower their benchmark interest rate on Thursday by a quarter percentage point, a move that will come on the heels of a half-point cut in September. They have projected one more quarter-point cut this year, in December, and an additional full point of reductions in 2025, according to the median estimate released in September.“The Fed is still likely to cut by 25 basis points at Thursday’s meeting and likely to cut again in December,” said Yung-Yu Ma at BMO Wealth Management. “As we move into 2025, we believe it’s possible that we only see two or three cuts for the year depending on the mix of policy and growth that plays out.”The makeup of Congress will also be key going forward.Democrats’ hopes to control the US House are fading, with Republicans increasingly confident they will hold unified control in Washington ahead of next year’s big fights over tax cuts and spending. Democrats need a net gain of just four House seats to wrest the slim majority from Republicans, but GOP gains in races in Pennsylvania, Michigan and North Carolina have offset losses in New York, putting the party ahead in its bid to retain control of the chamber.A “Red Wave,” consisting of Republican control of the executive and legislative branches, has occurred only eight times since World War II, according to Sam Stovall at CFRA.Under this scenario, the S&P 500 posted its highest average annual price increase for a Republican president at 12.9%, accompanied by a 75% frequency of advance, he said. The best return under a Democratic president occurred just six times under a split-Congress scenario, during which the S&P 500 gained an average 16.6% in price and rose 83% of the time.“Assuming the House goes Republican, we expect that a ‘Red Sweep’ outcome will play out in a similar fashion to the 2016 playbook but to a lesser degree given a more mature economic backdrop and higher equity valuations,” said Jeff Schulze at ClearBridge Investments. “Business animal spirits could be rekindled once again from Trump’s pro-business approach.”Schulze says that which could lead to a more robust capital expenditures and investment environment. A more favorable corporate tax regime, full extension of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and a lighter regulatory touch should outweigh the potential headwinds from increased tariffs and reduced immigration on corporate profits.“We expect cyclical leadership to continue in the coming months as the market anticipates stronger economic growth and better earnings delivery from this cohort than is currently priced,” Schulze noted.Stocks Hit Fresh Highs as ‘Red Sweep’ Wagers Grow“Favorable macro drivers still dominate, and the prospect of a Republican sweep and lower taxes is adding to the market enthusiasm,” said Ma at BMO. “That may get tempered in the coming weeks by more details regarding tariff policy or a continued rise in long-term Treasury yields, but for the past two years we’ve said that the environment is favorable for risk-taking and that remains the case.”In addition, the potential for extension of personal tax cuts under a Republican sweep are only marginally positive for the equity markets, he noted. Corporate tax cuts are much more significant, and while there have been promises to do more on this front, they come with unclear stipulations, including requirements that companies keep manufacturing operations in the US,” Ma concluded.The stock-market surge unleashed by Trump’s presidential victory is triggering buy signals for rules-based investment funds, adding fuel to the rally.“The year-end rally starts today and may be higher than investors were expecting,” Scott Rubner, a tactical specialist at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., wrote in a note to clients Wednesday. Behind it, he cited “unwinds of election hedges, re-levering, Buybacks, FOMO, Vanna,” a type of buying tied to the periodic expiration of option contracts.Volatility-controlled funds are expected to buy $50 billion of US shares in the next month and a total of $110 billion through January, according to an analysis by Nomura.“Markets hate uncertainty and now that the election is officially over, stocks are soaring today,” said Ryan Detrick at Carson Group. “Optimism over tax cuts, a still dovish Fed, and a potentially better economy are part of it, but the reality is the economy has been quite solid all year, so this really isn’t anything new. Back to your regularly scheduled bull market is how we see it.”At Ameriprise, Anthony Saglimbene says animal spirits through year-end could push major averages higher as the overhang of the election is removed and investors look to put excess cash to work in equities“Finally, US stocks may see tailwinds from not only the election results but a retreat in volatility hedging, corporations moving out of their buyback blackout periods as the earnings season winds down, and strong fourth-quarter seasonality factors (particularly in election years).”Chris Senyek at Wolfe Research says he remains bullish on stocks into year-end.“With Donald Trump winning the 47th Presidency of the United States, we believe that markets will heavily favor financials, US-based industrials (transports), energy, and crypto today and into year-end, he said. “We think more offensive tech outperforms as well with semis outperforming. By style, we’d own value, equal weight, small-cap and year-to-date laggards.”",The S&P 500 climbed 2.5% on bets the newly elected president will enact pro- growth policies that will boost Corporate America.

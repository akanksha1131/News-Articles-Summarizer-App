Stock market recommendations: According to Bajaj Broking Research, UPL, and Chennai Petroleum Corporation are the top stock picks for today. Here’s its view on Nifty, Bank Nifty and the top stock picks for July 4, 2025:In recent weeks, the Nifty index has showcased remarkable resilience, maintaining its upward trajectory and investor confidence despite a challenging macroeconomic and geopolitical environment. The index formed a nine month high of 25,669 on Monday’s trade. Index thereafter consolidated in a 300 points range with corrective bias signaling profit booking at higher levels after recent strong up move.The index during the current week rebounded from the immediate support area of 25,400-25,350. Going ahead, the index holding above 25,400-35,350 on a closing basis will lead to a pullback towards 25,900-26,000 levels in the coming sessions. However, failure to do so may lead to a healthy retracement or consolidation, with the index likely moving within the broader 25,200–25,700 range.The percentage of Nifty 500 constituents trading above their 200-day exponential moving average (EMA) — a widely tracked measure of market breadth — has shown a notable and broad-based recovery in recent months. After bottoming out below the 10% mark in March 2025, a level historically associated with extreme bearish sentiment and oversold market conditions, the indicator has since rebounded sharply and currently stands at approximately 59%.This resurgence reflects a meaningful shift in market dynamics, transitioning from narrow leadership to a more inclusive rally. Importantly, breadth thrusts of this nature have historically preceded or accompanied sustained bull market phases. In prior cycles, similar recoveries have seen the indicator rise to above 90%, suggesting there may be further upside potential in the current move.The improvement in this breadth metric indicates that the ongoing rally is gaining internal strength, with a growing number of stocks participating in the upside. This is a constructive signal for medium- to long-term investors, as healthy breadth tends to support the durability of upward market trends.Key positional support lies at 25,200–25,000 levels being the confluence of the 20 days EMA and the upper boundary of the recent consolidation breakout area (25,200-24,500), which is expected to act as a support level, showcasing change of polarity, where previous resistance turns into support.Bank Nifty consolidated with positive bias at the all-time high during last month. Escalating tensions in key global regions, which typically heighten market volatility, have not deterred the index's momentum.We expect the index to extend the current up move and head towards 58,500- 59,000 levels in the coming month, the measuring implication of the last 15 sessions consolidation breakout (57050-55150).The Index has rallied 18% in the last four months, hence some consolidation cannot be ruled out at higher levels. We believe dips in the coming month should be used as a buying opportunity. Key support is placed around 56,000-55,500.The stock has witnessed a strong rebound after a base at the 100 days EMA signaling strength. It is at the cusp of breaking above the high of May 2025 (699) thus offers fresh entry opportunity.The weekly 14 periods RSI has recently generated a buy signal moving above its nine periods average thus validating positive bias.We expect the stock to head higher towards 747 levels in the coming months being the 161.8% external retracement of the previous decline (699-618).The stock has recently generated a breakout above a falling channel in the weekly chart signaling strength and offers fresh entry opportunity.The breakout is supported by strong volume and the base of recent consolidation is placed at the 500 days EMA which supports the positive bias.The weekly stochastic has generated a buy signal moving above its nine periods average signaling positive bias. We expect the stock to head towards 787 levels in the coming months being the 61.8% retracement of the previous decline of October 2024 to March 2025 (999-433).","According to Bajaj Broking Research, UPL, and Chennai Petroleum Corporation are the top stock picks for today.

SEBI's Bank On Jane Street

US trading firm Jane Street has been barred by Indian market regulator, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), from domestic markets. SEBI has imposed restrictions on Jane Street trading firm, ordering them to surrender unlawful profits of Rs 4,843.57 crore for alleged index manipulation during expiry days to secure substantial gains in index options.The restrictions apply to JSI Investments, JSI2 Investments Pvt Ltd, Jane Street Singapore Pte Ltd, and Jane Street Asia Trading of Jane Street Group (JS Group).A Sebi interim order issued on Thursday revealed that JS Group entities accumulated profits exceeding Rs 43,289 crore from NSE index options between January 1, 2023 and March 31, 2025, spanning all product categories and NSE segments.The entities received instructions to stop participating in any fraudulent, manipulative or unfair trading practices, or engaging in activities that could violate regulations, whether directly or indirectly.Sebi identified JS Group's questionable trading patterns earlier this year. NSE, acting as the primary regulator, explicitly warned JS Group to avoid excessive risks in index options markets and cease trading patterns suggesting manipulation, according to a PTI report.Subsequently, JS Group assured NSE in February 2025 of their commitment to regulatory compliance.Despite receiving a cautionary notice in February and making declarations to NSE, Sebi observed that JS Group resumed apparent manipulative 'extended marking the close' trading patterns in May 2025, involving substantial and aggressive intervention in index and constituent markets near expiry day closing to influence index movements for illegal advantage.""Such egregious behaviour, in clear disregard/ defiance of the explicit advisory issued to them by NSE in February 2025, amply demonstrates that unlike the vast majority of Foreign Portfolio Investors and other market participants, JS Group is not a good faith actor that can be, or deserves to be, trusted.""In the face of such a strong prima facie case that allowing the JS Group to continue as before may severely compromise investor protection on an extraordinary scale, Sebi has a duty to directly intervene,"" Sebi's whole time member Ananth Narayan G said in the order.Consequently, Sebi mandated JS Group to surrender unlawful gains amounting to Rs 4,843.57 crore.","US trading firm Jane Street has been barred by Indian market regulator, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), from domestic markets.

Trent share price today: Stock drops around 9% after slower growth outlined at AGM; Nuvama downgrades,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/trent-share-price-today-stock-drops-around-9-after-slower-growth-outlined-at-agm-nuvama-downgrades/articleshow/122245807.cms,"Nuvama expressed its concerns about the potential slowdown in Trent's growth. (AI image)

Trent: Key AGM Updates

Trent Ltd, a Tata Group company, saw a significant share price decline of 8.7% to Rs 5,652 on the National Stock Exchange on Friday. This drop followed the company's AGM announcement regarding slower revenue growth, leading Nuvama brokerage to revise its rating to 'hold' and reduce the target price from Rs 6,627 to Rs 5,884.During its AGM, Trent revealed anticipated revenue growth of approximately 20% for Q1FY26, indicating a substantial reduction from its previous performance, according to an ET report. This forecast represents a considerable decrease from the 35% CAGR achieved during FY20-FY25, falling below the company's targeted 25% CAGR for future periods.Nuvama expressed its concerns about the potential slowdown, stating: ""At its AGM, Trent disappointed on near-term growth expectations in its core fashion business, which is expected to deliver ~20% growth in Q1FY26E, sharply down from its five-year CAGR of 35% (FY20–25). Management reaffirmed their aspiration of 25%-plus growth for the coming few years, but the current run rate falls short of it.""Following this development, Nuvama adjusted its projections downward, reducing FY26 and FY27 revenue forecasts by 5% and 6% respectively. Additionally, EBITDA estimates saw reductions of 9% and 12%.The brokerage's decision to adopt a more conservative investment position stemmed from the observed growth moderation, necessitating a reassessment of both Trent's earnings outlook and valuation.While downgrading its rating, Nuvama recognised Trent's enduring aspirations and implementation success, specifically highlighting its reaffirmed goal of achieving a tenfold revenue increase in the upcoming years—a strategic objective initially presented in FY23. During the AGM, the leadership team reported that revenue had already doubled since announcing this target.""This growth will be backed by robust additions of ~250 stores across formats as per management guidance, whose tone has historically been conservative. Accordingly, we remain confident of management beating this given the execution track record,"" Nuvama said.The financial services firm identified Zudio Beauty and Star Bazaar as key revenue generators for future expansion, whilst noting that both ventures require operational stability before undertaking significant growth initiatives.Star Bazaar outlook: Trent Hypermarket (Star Bazaar) has the potential to grow larger than Westside and Zudio, primarily due to the substantial size of India's food retail sector.Independent operations: Star Bazaar will maintain its focus on Trent's branded products, without plans to integrate with Big Basket, which is viewed as a higher-priced alternative.Growth targets: Management confirmed their FY23 target of achieving 10x revenue growth, highlighting that revenue has already increased twofold since the announcement.Retail expansion plans: The organisation plans to establish over 250 new stores across various formats in FY26, with flexibility to increase this number based on market dynamics and real estate availability.Trent's share price has increased by approximately 70% in 2025, reflecting positive investor sentiment towards its growth strategy. However, Nuvama has expressed concerns about the sustainability of these high valuations, noting indications of declining momentum, according to the ET report.""Underwhelming near-term growth prompts the downgrade to 'HOLD' as the current valuation is too demanding. A significant jump in growth profile, or pickup in other levers i.e. Star Bazaar, Zudio Beauty remain the key risks to our view,"" the brokerage concluded.The company disclosed its Q1 business performance update on Friday morning, post market opening.For the April–June quarter of FY26, Trent's standalone revenue from product sales (including GST) reached Rs 5,061 crore, showing a 20% increase from Rs 4,228 crore in the corresponding period of the previous year, aligning with their projected guidance.As at June 30, 2025, Trent's retail presence comprised 248 Westside stores, 766 Zudio stores (with two locations in the UAE), and 29 stores representing various other lifestyle concepts.(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market and other asset classes given by experts are their own.

India-US trade: New Vietnam deal raises red flags; GTRI urges New Delhi to tread carefully,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/india-us-trade-new-vietnam-deal-raises-red-flags-gtri-urges-new-delhi-to-tread-carefully/articleshow/122217750.cms,"Representative image

A new trade agreement between the United States and Vietnam is sending ripples through Asian export markets, with Indian exporters being advised to take caution, according to a report by the Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI).The deal, announced by US President Donald Trump, imposes a flat 20 per cent tariff on all Vietnamese exports to the US, a move that could disrupt Vietnam’s $135 billion export flow and reverse two decades of trade liberalisation.“For Indian exporters eyeing Vietnam as a competitor and partner in regional value chains, the deal presents both cautionary lessons and strategic implications,” the GTRI report stated, according to news agency ANI.The trade pact replaces Vietnam’s 2000 Bilateral Trade Agreement (BTA), which allowed Vietnamese goods preferential access to the US at tariff rates between 2 per cent and 10 per cent. Key sectors like textiles, footwear, seafood, and furniture, which had driven Vietnam’s export growth from $800 million in 2001 to over $135 billion, will now lose that cost advantage.The new deal, as per AFP, also includes a punitive 40 per cent tariff on goods routed through Vietnam but originally manufactured in countries like China, a measure seen as targeting “transshipment” to evade stricter US tariffs.However, trade experts have raised legal concerns about this provision, warning that it may breach World Trade Organisation (WTO) norms since routing does not change the origin of goods.Trump announced the deal on his Truth Social platform, stating that “Vietnam will do something that they have never done before — give the United States of America total access to their Markets for Trade.” In return, Vietnamese exports face a 20 per cent US tariff, down from a previously proposed 46 per cent but still more than double the original BTA terms.Peter Navarro, Trump’s trade advisor, previously accused Vietnam of being a “colony of China,” alleging that a third of its exports were in fact Chinese goods relabelled to bypass tariffs. While Hanoi confirmed a resolution on reciprocal tariffs, it did not detail the final terms.For India, the timing of this deal is critical. The GTRI report cautions Indian negotiators, who are in the final stages of their own trade talks with the US, to learn from Vietnam’s experience, especially the risks of sudden reversals in tariff concessions, unclear rules on product origin, and flat duty structures that can undercut long-term trade stability.With Washington reshaping its Asia trade strategy, Indian policymakers and exporters are being urged to closely track developments and adapt proactively.The GTRI concluded that understanding the vulnerabilities exposed by the Vietnam deal could help India avoid similar pitfalls in its own trade trajectory.","New trade agreement between the United States and Vietnam is sending ripples through Asian export markets.

EU Nations Buying Russia Oil ‘FRUSTRATE’ Zelensky; Ukraine President Goes On Ugly Rant | Watch





What’s the 500% tariff threat about?

The proposed sanctions legislation, which has garnered support from 84 co-sponsors as noted by Graham, seeks to exert pressure on nations such as India and China to cease purchasing Russian oil and commodities. The objective is to diminish Moscow's wartime economy and compel Russian President Vladimir Putin to engage in negotiations regarding Ukraine, whilst providing Trump with necessary authority.

The bill, first introduced in March, is anticipated to advance in August. This initiative aligns with the United States' intensified measures to impose stricter economic restrictions on Russia, as Trump attempts to persuade Putin towards diplomatic discussions amidst the ongoing Ukraine conflict.

The Senate postponed introducing the legislation following the White House's resistance to broadening sanctions during Trump's endeavours to improve relations with the Russian leader. Nevertheless, the administration now appears prepared to endorse these restrictive measures.

How will it impact India?

Hence, a 500% tariff on countries importing oil from Russia may impact India very badly. Incidentally, India has also stepped up oil imports from America. United States crude oil exports to India saw a substantial rise, reaching 439,000 barrels per day in June, marking a notable increase from the 280,000 barrels per day recorded in May.

Will Trump really sign the 500% tariff order?

Russia's Response to The Bill

India, a large importer of crude oil from Russia, may have to watch out for a new US bill which proposes imposing a 500% tariff on countries that import from Russia. In an interview with ABC News, Senator Lindsey Graham said that he wanted the US to impose tariffs to stop them from supporting Vladimir Putin's war machine. Moscow launched full-scale invasion of Ukraine three years ago on February 24, 2022.""Big breakthrough here. So what does this bill do? If you're buying products from Russia and you're not helping Ukraine, then there's a 500 percent tariff on your products coming into the United States. India and China buy 70 percent of Putin's oil. They keep his war machine going. My bill has 84 co-sponsors. It would allow the president to put tariffs on China and India and other countries to get them -- stop them from supporting Putin's war machine, to get him to the table. For the first time yesterday, the president told me,"" Graham said.Also read: 'Economic bunker buster for India, China': How this US senator's Russia sanctions bill would prove 'bone crushing' for trade- if passed Graham has actively been advocating for the legislation, cautioning that it would serve as an ""economic bunker buster"" for nations such as India and China, which have substantially enhanced their imports of Russian petroleum products.India significantly altered its oil procurement patterns after Russia's Ukraine invasion in February 2022.The country transitioned from its traditional Middle Eastern suppliers to Russian oil sources, capitalising on favourable prices resulting from Western sanctions and European embargoes. Russian oil deliveries to India stood at 1.96 million barrels per day (bpd) in May.The transformation in India's oil import strategy has been remarkable, with Russian oil's share increasing from less than 1 per cent to roughly 40-44 per cent of total crude purchases in a short period.Also Read | India laps up discounted crude: RIL, Nayara Energy get big chunk of Russia’s flagship oil exports; Reliance world’s single biggest buyer of Urals India's Russian oil imports reached new heights in June, surpassing combined imports from Saudi Arabia and Iraq, during a period of market uncertainty following Israel's major offensive against Iran.As the world's third-largest oil importer and consumer, India has secured roughly 5.1 million barrels of international crude oil, which its refineries convert into various fuel products including petrol and diesel.""According to preliminary analysis by global trade analytics firm Kpler quoted in a PTI report, Indian refiners are expected to purchase 2-2.2 million barrels per day of Russian crude oil in June, reaching a two-year peak and exceeding the total quantities acquired from Iraq, Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Kuwait.""India has also become the primary recipient of Russian Urals oil grade transported by sea in 2025, receiving 80% of the total exports. The country's two private refineries have substantially boosted their imports of this lower-priced crude.According to Kpler statistics referenced in a Bloomberg report, India acquired 231 million barrels of Urals through June 24, with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Nayara Energy Ltd. jointly obtaining 45% of Russia's exports of this medium-sour grade.The proportion of Urals purchases by these two private Indian refiners has steadily increased in recent years, particularly in 2025. Reliance has positioned itself as the world's largest buyer of Urals, having purchased 77 million barrels in the current year.Graham has clarified that Trump would retain discretionary power through a waiver provision, enabling him to decide on the bill's implementation should it successfully pass through Congress.""I was playing with him (Trump). He says, ""It's time to move -- move your bill. There's a waiver in the bill, Mr. President. You're in charge whether or not it's to be implemented."" But we're going to give President Trump a tool in the toolbox he doesn't have today.

He belongs to a group of inveterate Russophobes. If it were up to him, these sanctions would have been imposed long ago,"" said Peskov.Peskov further questioned the effectiveness of such measures by stating, ""Would that have helped the (Ukraine) settlement (process)? That is a question that those who initiate such events should ask themselves.""","India is the world's third-largest oil importer and consumer.

What led to Sebi's actions?

How did Jane St manipulate stocks?

So, what happens next?

Established in Aug 1999, The New York-headquartered Jane Street has offices across the world. In June 2025, one of its co-founders was alleged to have financed a coup to topple the govt in South Sudan. The person then said he was duped into funding the coup. Sam Bankman-Fried, once the poster boy of the crypto world and now a convicted fraudster, once worked at Jane St.Four Jane St entities operated in India as registered foreign portfolio investors. The regulator banned the four entities from the market. Sebi also asked the entities to jointly disgorge illegal gains worth nearly Rs 4,850 crore. Sebi said Jane St had used two key strategies to manipulate the domestic stocks and futures & options (F&O) markets to make illegal gains over several years.One of the strategies was to aggressively buy Bank Nifty's constituent stocks and futures in the morning. At the same time, it would buy put options on the index. In the afternoon, it would sell stocks bought in the morning. This selling pushed up prices of options on Bank Nifty, which the fund had bought in the morning.Once put option prices rose, those were sold to make huge profits. The other strategy was concentrated selling or buying of Nifty index options in the last two hours of the expiry day to swing index levels to profit from such trades.The fund has been asked to present its side of the case to Sebi within 21 days. Sebi is expected to expand the scope of its investigations into the trading operations of Jane St in India. The interim order focuses on the Jan 2023 to March 2025 period. The regulator is also expected to investigate if manipulative strategies were used in other indices and in BSE's segments.","Four Jane St entities operated in India as registered foreign portfolio investors.

Saudi Arabia, Russia and six other major oil producers from the OPEC+ alliance will meet on Saturday to decide their crude output strategy for August, with analysts expecting the bloc to approve another production hike of 411,000 barrels per day (bpd), mirroring decisions made for May, June and July.The meeting will be held virtually and will include representatives from Iraq, the UAE, Kuwait, Kazakhstan, Algeria and Oman, according to news agency AFP.The so-called “Voluntary Eight” (V8) group within OPEC+ had earlier stunned markets by reversing course from prolonged supply cuts and opting to raise production sharply from May onwards.This shift has pulled down oil prices to a narrow band of $65–$70 per barrel, far below the highs seen earlier during Middle East tensions.Analysts cited by AFP say that the alliance appears increasingly focused on reclaiming market share over price stability. “The group has placed an increased focus on regaining market shares over price stability,” said Saxo Bank analyst Ole Hansen, highlighting the competitive pressure from rising supply elsewhere, including the United States.Despite the scheduled hike, actual supply additions could fall short.As per AFP, Rystad Energy’s Jorge Leon said that the real increase might be only 250,000–300,000 bpd, much like May’s 200,000 bpd gain, despite doubled quotas. This shortfall is partly due to non-compliance by countries like Kazakhstan and Iraq, whose production exceeded agreed limits.UBS analyst Giovanni Staunovo added that such inconsistencies may be pushing leading producers like Saudi Arabia to tighten enforcement via output-driven price pressure.While market watchers are bracing for the expected rise, there is little anticipation of price shocks, especially as geopolitical concerns have eased. A recent 12-day conflict between Iran and Israel, which had temporarily pushed prices over $80, didn’t cause supply disruptions.“Given there were no supply disruptions so far, the war is unlikely to impact the decision,” Staunovo said, as cited by AFP. Hansen echoed that the conflict could even justify faster production increases if Iran’s exports face future hurdles.According to news agency Reuters, earlier, some OPEC+ insiders believed that the group could consider a hike larger than 411,000 bpd. But consensus still leans toward a continuation of the current pace, especially as Brent futures hovered around $68.30 per barrel and WTI near $66.50 in holiday-thinned trade ahead of the meeting.Analysts such as Tamas Varga of PVM warned that additional output, if sustained, may swell global oil inventories in the second half of the year. “Oil balance estimates will be reassessed and will suggest accelerated swelling in global oil reserves,” Varga said, as quoted by Reuters.The eight OPEC+ countries have already committed to raising production by 1.37 million bpd over four months, roughly 62% of the 2.2 million bpd they initially pledged to cut. With US nuclear talks with Iran possibly resuming and global economic policies shifting, the alliance’s strategy is under growing scrutiny.Still, Saturday’s meeting is not expected to trigger any major market volatility, as traders are largely in a “wait-and-see mode”, said Price Futures Group’s Phil Flynn, who cited upcoming US fiscal changes and lingering tariff uncertainty as additional variables, according to Reuters.","OPEC+ to meet on Saturday to decide output strategy for August.

Muted demand: Home loan growth falls to 2.7% in FY25,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/muted-demand-home-loan-growth-falls-to-2-7-in-fy25/articleshow/122258658.cms,"MUMBAI: India's retail lending sector slowed notably in FY25, as a mix of economic headwinds, regulatory tightening, and shifting borrower behaviour led to a broad-based moderation in credit growth. According to CRIF High Mark's annual How India Lends FY25 report, the deceleration was especially visible in home loans and personal loans, which have traditionally anchored the retail credit engine.Home loan originations rose by just 2.7% year-on-year, increasing by Rs 28,163 crore to Rs 10.7 lakh crore, a sharp fall from the 9.4% growth (Rs 97,978 crore) recorded in FY24. The slowdown was even starker in volume terms, with originations falling by 2 lakh to 34.7 lakh loans in FY25, compared to 36.6 lakh a year ago. High property prices and macroeconomic uncertainties dampened demand, although public sector banks managed to grow their market share, partially offsetting declines seen by private lenders.The overall consumption loan market also showed signs of fatigue. Origination value growth fell to 10.0% in FY25 from 14.7% the previous year, while volume growth slipped marginally to 9.7% from 10.0%. This pullback was largely due to increased lender caution, tighter risk controls, and rising stress in unsecured credit categories.Personal loans were hit harder, with origination value declining by 2.9% or Rs 26,615 crore to Rs 8.8 lakh crore, down from Rs 9.1 lakh crore in FY24. While volumes rose to 14.6 crore loans, marking 8.3% growth over the previous year, this was a steep drop from the 26.9% surge in FY24. The increase in average ticket size masked slower borrower acquisition, as lenders turned risk-averse in the face of mounting delinquencies.Two-wheeler loans, once a fast-expanding segment, saw their growth halve. Origination value rose by 10.6% or Rs 10,513 crore to Rs 1.1 lakh crore, compared to 25.1% growth (Rs 20,019 crore) in FY24. Auto loans also lost momentum, with originations increasing by just 5.2% or Rs 17,692 crore to Rs 3.6 lakh crore in FY25. This marked a sharp drop from 15.3% growth in FY24 and a 37.6% rise in FY23. Normalised vehicle demand post-pandemic and a high base effect contributed to the cooling trend.Consumer durable loans recorded muted expansion, with originations rising 3.3% or Rs 5,144 crore to Rs 1.6 lakh crore, despite strong volume growth. Inflationary pressures and flat wage growth compressed ticket sizes, capping value growth. Credit card issuance, meanwhile, fell sharply by 26.4%, down 77.7 lakh cards to 2.2 crore from 2.9 crore lakh in FY24.","Home loan originations rose by just 2.7% year-on-year, a sharp fall from 9.4% growth in FY24.

Tata Power plans to contest Rs 4k-cr Singapore arbitral order,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/tata-power-plans-to-contest-rs-4k-cr-singapore-arbitral-order/articleshow/122258556.cms,"MUMBAI: Tata Power, the utility arm of the Tata Group, plans to contest the $490 million (Rs 4,200 crore) verdict handed down by the Singapore arbitral tribunal. The ruling stems from alleged breaches of confidentiality agreements with investment firm Kleros Capital Partners concerning a potential coal mining project in Russia.At Tata Power's annual shareholder meeting on Friday, chairman N Chandrasekaran said: ""The company is reviewing the contents of the July 1 arbitration award and is discussing with lawyers. It will look at all options, including challenging the decision."" He emphasised, ""This is top of the agenda.""The Singapore International Arbitration Centre granted Kleros a monetary award totalling more than $618 million. This included $490 million in damages, alongside interest payments exceeding $120 million (calculated at 5.33% from Nov 30, 2020 - when the lawsuit commenced - until payment settlement), and $8 million in legal costs with interest (at 5.33% from July 1, 2025--when the verdict was issued-until final payment).Tata Power has not accounted for any provisions in its financial accounts in relation to the arbitral award. Since July 1, Tata Power stock has lost nearly 1.5%. On Friday, the stock on BSE closed at Rs 401.The Singapore arbitral tribunal held that Tata Power breached certain clauses of the non-disclosure agreements it had entered. However, in its FY25 report, the Indian company maintained that Kleros's case was an afterthought and therefore lacked merit.Also, Kleros failed to substantiate its project value claims concerning loss of opportunity and compensation negotiations. Consequently, Tata Power believed its position was strong and deemed it unnecessary to make provisions concerning the arbitration ruling, the FY25 report showed.In another dispute, Adaro International (Singapore) has sought damages of $106 million from Tata Power for alleged contractual breaches. Tata Power, in turn, has filed a counterclaim for $229 million for losses suffered due to non-supply of coal by Adaro. According to its FY25 report, Tata Power entered into a coal supply agreement with Adaro for its Trombay, Mumbai power plant, which required it to procure a certain quantity of coal annually. Both parties have initiated arbitration proceedings.Responding to shareholders' questions regarding ongoing litigation cases, Chandrasekaran said: ""With regard to the other arbitration case, the company believes that it should definitely challenge that. That is something that is waiting for resolution.""The company currently imports 15 million tonnes of coal yearly for its domestic thermal power operations.Interestingly, Tata Power is reassessing its thermal power strategy, four years after deciding to focus on green energy instead of expanding thermal power.Chandrasekaran said: ""The company had declared that it will not expand in coal-based energy. However, this decision is being reviewed by the board due to the increasing demand for electricity in the country. The country may not be able to switch off all coal projects in the near future. It may take longer because the country's net zero target is 2070 whereas the company's target is 2045. So to meet the immediate demands of the industry, should there be a need to look at participation in additional coal-based projects is something that the board constantly looks at. ""He indicated that the company has no intentions to convert its coal-based power plants to gas-based plants. ""Our coal plants will be coming to the end of their life in the next 10 to 15 years. After that, we will slowly replace them with renewables"".",Tata Power plans to contest the $490 million verdict handed down by the Singapore arbitral tribunal.

Multiple Strategies:

NSE caution letter:

MUMBAI: Markets regulator Sebi late on Thursday banned US-based foreign fund Jane Street from the Indian market for manipulating stocks and derivatives segments over several years to make huge illegal gains.Jane St, known for their quant-based trading strategies, has also been asked to disgorge nearly Rs 4,850 crore - illegal gains accrued to them by trading on the NSE between Jan 2023 and March 2025, a Sebi order said. This is the highest-ever disgorgement amount ordered by Sebi for any kind of illegal activity in the market.In an interim order, Sebi banned JSI Investments, JSI2 Investments, Jane Street Singapore and Jane Street Asia Trading, from trading in the Indian market until further notice. The markets regulator's investigation will continue.So far, Sebi has identified two types of manipulative strategies. One was to buy heavily in Bank Nifty's 12 constituent stocks and futures in the morning session, then buying put options on the index, selling the stocks aggressively in the afternoon to pull down Bank Nifty that in turn pushed up index options prices to eventually make huge profits.The other strategy was to push for concentrated selling or buying in the last two hours of the expiry day to swing index levels and make profits.The investigation report noted that although Jane St incurred some losses in some parts of the trades, profits from the rest more than made up for the losses.Sebi's interim investigation showed that between Jan 2023 and March 2025, Jane St had made a total profit of Rs 36,502 crore. During that period, on Jan 17, 2024, the trading firm had made a profit of Rs 735 crore, the highest single-day gain for the now-banned foreign fund.While Sebi was investigating Jane St's trading activities, on Feb 6, 2025, NSE had issued a caution letter to Jane Street Singapore and its related entity, asking them to refrain from taking large positions in the Indian market and to refrain from undertaking certain trading patterns. However, in disregard of NSE's caution letter, and the group's commitments to the exchange, ""Jane St was observed to continue to run very large (trading) positions in index options"", Sebi's report noted.Sources said there is a strong case that the period of investigation as well as exchanges on which Jane St had traded could be expanded to unearth the full scale of manipulation in the Indian market by the US-based global quant trading giant.""The interim order has only looked at 18 major days of prima facie Bank Nifty index manipulation on expiry day between Jan 2023 and March 2025), and three days of nifty index manipulation on expiry day during May 2025,"" sources said. ""Investigations into other expiry days, other indices (including across exchanges), and other potential patterns besides the two highlighted in the order will need to continue.""""There should not be any major market impact from this enforcement action,"" sources said.

Weak Re boosts foreign currency FDs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/weak-re-boosts-foreign-currency-fds/articleshow/122258394.cms,"CHENNAI: A weak rupee was among the reasons that made foreign currency deposits attractive for NRIs. The net inflow under foreign currency non-resident (B) accounts increased by 11% to $7.1 billion in FY25 from $6.4 billion in FY24. It comes after NRIs pulled out their deposits earlier, turning the category negative during 2020-21 and 2021-22.Data available in RBI's annual reports shows that FCNR (B) recorded a net outflow of $3.8 billion and $3.6 billion during two pandemic years of 2020-21 and 2021-22, respectively. However, its net inflow revived during 2022-23 and stood at $2.4 billion.In FY25, the net inflow under non-resident deposits basket comprising non-resident external (rupee) account (NRE), non-resident ordinary (NRO) account and FCNR (B) was at $16.2 billion, the highest in the past 11 years.

Tariff hike already priced in



Reliance Jio may have outpaced Bharti Airtel in both overall revenue and per-user revenue growth in the June quarter, aided by strong additions in its high-paying fixed wireless access (FWA) home broadband segment, analysts said ahead of the telecom sector’s first-quarter earnings.Market leader Jio is expected to report a 1.8% sequential jump in average revenue per user (ARPU) to Rs 210, driven by the addition of 2 million FWA users—part of a likely net addition of 7.2 million subscribers, according to JM Financial. Airtel while likely to clock a higher ARPU at Rs 249, may see a lower sequential growth rate of 1.6%, the brokerage added, according to an ET report.Vodafone Idea (Vi), meanwhile, is projected to report an ARPU of Rs 167, up 1.6% from the previous quarter, buoyed by subscriber upgrades, improved user mix, and one extra day in the June quarter. Crucially, Vi is also expected to maintain its user base for the first time in recent memory, aided by an expanding 4G footprint and wider rollout of services.Jio’s strong subscriber additions are set to translate into a 2.7% quarter-on-quarter rise in revenue to Rs 31,200 crore, JM Financial estimated. However, its standalone net profit may stay flat at Rs 6,640 crore, due to the full-quarter impact of higher depreciation and amortisation following 5G spectrum capitalisation and fixed asset additions in the March quarter.Airtel’s wireless service revenues are forecast to grow 2.6% to Rs 27,305 crore, while its consolidated net profit could jump 47% sequentially to Rs 7,690 crore, on the back of robust mobile broadband growth. JM Financial expects Airtel to add 5.5 million mobile broadband users in Q1—down from 6.6 million in Q4 FY25—while its total subscriber addition is pegged at 2.3 million, the report said.According to BofA Securities, Airtel’s enterprise revenues may remain under pressure due to its exit from low-margin commodity wholesale voice services.For Vodafone Idea, JM Financial expects a modest 1.1% sequential rise in revenue to Rs 11,100 crore, with net loss narrowing slightly to Rs 7,145 crore. Analysts say Vi’s stabilising user base—after years of decline—is a result of its improving network and recent 5G expansion.“We consider this trend to sustain going ahead, given a better network now,” BofA noted in a report.The impact of the recent tariff hikes by telcos has already played out, and analysts now anticipate the next round of price increases only by next year. “We expect telcos to raise tariffs by around 12% in 2026,” BofA Securities said.Vi recently launched phase two of its 5G rollout across 23 cities, aiming to cover all 17 of its priority circles. However, the telco still lags nearly 2.5 years behind Jio and Airtel in the 5G race, having lost significant market share since the rollout began.","Reliance Jio is expected to report a 1.8% sequential jump in average revenue per user (ARPU) to Rs 210.

ITR Deadline Extension: What I-T Department Has Said

ITRs for Assessment Year 2025-26 feature significant modifications in structure and content, designed to streamline the compliance process, improve transparency and ensure precise reporting.

Due to these alterations, additional duration is required for developing systems, integrating components and evaluating the associated utilities.

Additionally, credits originating from Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) statements, which must be submitted by May 31, 2025, are anticipated to appear in early June, thus restricting the available timeframe for return submission without such an extension.

ITR filing FY 2024-25: It’s the month of July and every year this time, taxpayers are usually scrambling to get together documents to file their income tax return or ITR. However, those who file ITR-2 or ITR-3 have not yet been able to start the process of ITR filing since the utilities have not yet been released online (incometax.gov.in) or offline by the tax department.However, taxpayers have little reason to worry since this year the Income Tax Department has extended the deadline to file ITR from July 31 to September 15, 2025. Experts expect the ITR-2 and ITR-3 forms to be released soon.E xperts are of the view that the extensive changes in the Income Tax Return forms and the complexity of ITR-2 and ITR-3 has possibly caused the delay in release from the Income Tax Department’s end.Sonu Iyer, Partner and National Leader People Advisory Services - Tax, EY India explains, “The ITR-2 / ITR-3 return forms are applicable for individuals with complex financial profiles such as income from multiple house properties, capital gains, foreign assets and foreign income, business or professional income (in the case of ITR-3), directorships, unlisted equity shares, total income exceeding INR 5 million, brought forward and carry forward of losses, etc.Also Read | Income Tax Return e-filing: Can you keep switching between new and old tax regime every year? What taxpayers should know “These forms are significantly more detailed than the simpler ITR-1/ ITR-4 forms. The delay in releasing the e-filing utility (online and offline) for ITR-2 / ITR-3 can be attributed to the substantive changes introduced in the return forms such as separate reporting of capital gains earned before and after 23 July 2024, detailed reporting of deductions / exemptions, reporting of TDS section codes, etc,” Sonu Iyer tells TOI.According to the EY tax expert, such changes require comprehensive technical modifications to align the utility with the enhanced reporting requirements and provisions of the Finance Act, 2024.The Income Tax Department has extended the deadline for filing returns to 15 September 2025 recognizing the time required to update the utilities and the time required for system readiness,” she adds.* Salary/pension earnings* Revenue from multiple residential properties* Any amount of capital gains* Overseas income or assets* Agricultural proceeds exceeding Rs.5,000* Those with RNOR/NRI status* Company directors or holders of unlisted equity* Cases involving combined spousal incomePersons earning from business or professional activitiesExcel-based utility now accommodates revised return submissions under Section 139(8A).Also Read | ITR e-filing AY 2025-25: What is Annual Information Statement (AIS) and how is it different from Form 26AS?

Scholar Before Stateswoman



Prime Minister Narendra Modi met his Indian roots Trinidad and Tobago counterpart Kamla Persad-Bissessar on Friday (Thursday in T&T) and called her “Bihar ki Beti” (daughter of Bihar), spotlighting her ancestral roots in Bihar’s Buxar district.While addressing a community event during PM Modi's visit, Bissessar praised PM Modi and recited his poem from his book 'Aankh Aa Dhanya Chhe'.Kamla Persad-Bissessar is the first woman to serve as Prime Minister of Trinidad and Tobago, a Caribbean nation. Born on April 4, 1952, in Siparia, southern Trinidad, she has also held the positions of Attorney General and leader of the opposition, becoming the first woman in the country to hold each of these roles. According to her official profile on the World Economic Forum, she has been the political leader of the united national congress (UNC) since January 2010.Before entering national politics, Persad-Bissessar served as an alderman and later made her way to Parliament as the representative from Siparia in 1995. Over the years, she held several cabinet positions, including Attorney General, Minister of Legal Affairs, and Minister of Education.Kamla Persad-Bissessar has deep ancestral ties to India — more specifically, to Bhelupur village in Bihar’s Buxar district. In 2012, she visited her village during a private trip and called it one of the most emotional moments of her life. Welcomed with traditional Bihari folk songs, flower garlands, and heartfelt celebrations, she had told the villagers: “I feel I’ve come home.”Her contributions have not only earned her acclaim in Trinidad and Tobago but also recognition in India. In 2012, she was conferred the Pravasi Bharatiya Samman — the highest honour for overseas Indians — by then President Pratibha Patil, acknowledging her outstanding leadership and her efforts in strengthening India-Trinidad ties.Kamla Persad-Bissessar earned a Bachelor of Arts and a Diploma in Education from the University of the West Indies, followed by a law degree from Hugh Wooding Law School, where she was ranked top of her class.She later completed an Executive MBA from the Arthur Lok Jack Graduate School of Business in Trinidad in 2006.Before stepping into politics, Persad-Bissessar spent over six years in academics — teaching at the University of the West Indies, St Andrew High School in Jamaica, and serving as a Consultant Lecturer at the Jamaica College of Insurance. She also worked as a social worker with the Church of England Children's Society in London, combining compassion with intellect long before entering Parliament.","Kamla Persad-Bissessar is the first woman to serve as Prime Minister of Trinidad and Tobago, a Caribbean nation.

Why it matters

The big picture

What happens next, he warns, could be one of three scenarios:

A politically unpopular slashing of spending.

A massive increase in taxes.

Or a monetary intervention involving printing more money and lowering interest rates - which would “devalue the dollar and hurt bondholders.”

Between the lines

Zoom in

What they are saying

Dalio sees systemic risk not just for America, but for the global economy: “The US Treasury market is the backbone of all capital markets, which are the backbones of our economic and social conditions.” If confidence in US debt erodes, the entire financial architecture could wobble.

Ken Rogoff, former chief economist of the IMF, agrees: “It’s not clear markets will tolerate” further borrowing sprees when a real crisis hits. He warned that the US is leaving itself without fiscal headroom to respond to future emergencies.

Even the dollar - long considered a safe haven - is starting to reflect these jitters. It just posted its worst first-half performance since 1973, a signal that foreign investors may be losing confidence in the US fiscal trajectory.

The Trump administration’s view

The math doesn’t add up - at least not for Dalio

Catch up quick

Congress passed the bill 218–214 after weeks of internal GOP wrangling.

The Senate version was made law with Vice President JD Vance casting the tie-breaking vote.

The CBO estimates 11.8 million Americans will lose health coverage and 3 million will lose food stamp eligibility by 2034.

Some Republicans expressed discomfort with the deficits - then voted yes anyway.

What’s next

President Donald Trump’s newly passed $3.4 trillion tax and spending package - dubbed by supporters as “One Big Beautiful Bill” - is being denounced by Wall Street figures, economists, and bond market analysts as a fiscal time bomb. Among the most vocal: Ray Dalio, founder of Bridgewater Associates, who says the bill will lead to “big, painful disruptions” for American families and the global financial system if not urgently reversed.The legislation, passed with razor-thin margins in Congress, is expected to add $3.4 trillion to the national deficit over the next decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office. It comes at a time of relative economic stability - not a war, recession, or pandemic. Critics argue that deficit spending without crisis justification marks a dangerous shift in American fiscal policy.Dalio breaks it down in stark terms: annual federal spending will balloon to around $7 trillion, while revenues will hover near $5 trillion. “The debt... is now about 6x of the money taken in, 100 percent of GDP, and about $230,000 per American family,” Dalio wrote. In ten years, those numbers could rise to “7.5x the money taken in, 130 percent of GDP, and $425,000 per family.”This isn’t just theoretical. Rising federal debt will demand more borrowing, and that means higher interest and principal payments. Dalio estimates that those costs will soar from $10 trillion today to $18 trillion - with annual interest alone doubling to $2 trillion.The bond market - where the US borrows money - has already begun sending distress signals. Yields on long-term Treasurys jumped in May, nearing their highest levels in two decades, reflecting unease over the government’s fiscal trajectory.Bill Gross, founder of Pimco and one of the bond market’s most respected voices, likened the US to “a teenager with a credit card that has no limits.” He warned that the payment is coming - not via default, but through “a weak dollar and higher interest rates.”The Wall Street Journal, in an in-depth analysis, highlighted the extraordinary nature of the moment: a historic deficit without a national emergency. Typically, large-scale federal borrowing is reserved for times of crisis - like the 2008 financial collapse or the Covid pandemic.This time is different. “The market has been willing to tolerate spikes in borrowing during crises... What stands out now... is that America is bingeing on debt when there’s no such emergency requiring it,” the WSJ noted.Moody’s projects that the deficit, already at $1.8 trillion (6% of GDP), will climb to nearly 9% by 2035. That would push the national debt from just under 100% of GDP today to more than 130% - surpassing even World War II-era highs.President Trump and Republican lawmakers say the bill’s $4.5 trillion in tax cuts will supercharge economic growth. They argue that cuts to Medicaid, food stamps, and green energy subsidies are essential to ""rightsizing"" government.“For all cost-cutting Republicans, of which I am one, REMEMBER, you still have to get reelected,” Trump posted online. “We will make it all up, times 10, with GROWTH, more than ever before.”They also tout provisions such as new deductions for tips and overtime, a hike in the child tax credit, and business incentives to spur investment. Trump calls the bill “a phenomenal victory” and plans to sign it on July 4th.Dalio doesn’t buy the growth-will-save-us logic. He warns that the exploding interest burden will force the Fed to either crush the economy with higher rates or suppress rates artificially - triggering inflation and dollar devaluation.The scenario he paints is bleak: “Unless this path is soon rectified to bring the budget deficit from roughly 7% of GDP to about 3%... big, painful disruptions will likely occur.”That includes a potential bond market revolt, skyrocketing borrowing costs for households and businesses, and a shrinking safety net just as economic headwinds build.Markets are watching closely. The Fed, already navigating post-pandemic economic turbulence, may have to intervene if long-term rates spike. That could limit its ability to fight inflation or support growth.Foreign investors, who hold nearly one-third of US public debt, may start reallocating to other safer assets. As Harvard economist Jeremy Stein puts it, “I wouldn’t be surprised... if they start shifting that reinvestment more towards, say, Europe or German bonds.”The cost of Trump’s “big, beautiful” bill may not be fully visible today - but Dalio and Wall Street are betting we’ll all feel it tomorrow.(With inputs from agencies)","Congress passed $3.4 trillion tax and spending package - dubbed by supporters as ‘One Big Beautiful Bill’ Critics argue that deficit spending without crisis justification marks a dangerous shift in American fiscal policy.

“There has never been a more intimate connection between a nation’s ability to generate huge amounts of electricity at affordable prices... and its economic and military might,” the New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman wrote this week. ""The Chinese can’t believe their luck.""

Why it matters

The big picture

Trump’s bill quickly phases out tax credits for utility-scale wind and solar projects and cuts incentives for electric vehicle buyers years ahead of schedule.

The bill adds intricate restrictions on battery tax credits that exclude companies tied to “prohibited foreign entities” like China-ironically making the credits near-impossible to claim.

The bill also kills the methane fee from the Inflation Reduction Act and delays permitting for key grid upgrades, all while locking in $4.5 trillion in tax cuts, $1.2 trillion in safety net reductions, and $350 billion in hardline immigration and military spending.

Friedman summed it up sharply: “In one fell swoop, this bill will make your home hotter, your air conditioning bill higher, your clean energy job scarcer, America’s auto industry weaker and China happier.”

Zoom in: Texas shows the stakes

What they’re saying:

Elon Musk: “Utterly insane and destructive.”

Nick Nigro, WSJ: “The big-picture outlook for energy is we are going to be less competitive because of this law.”

Ray Dalio : “This will lead to unimaginable tax increases or a lot of printing and devaluing of money.”

: “This will lead to unimaginable tax increases or a lot of printing and devaluing of money.” Thomas Friedman: “China may have to make July 4 its own national holiday going forward: American Electricity Dependence Day.”

Between the lines

Debt dangers

Beyond energy, the bill also obliterates fiscal sanity. Ray Dalio, founder of Bridgewater Associates, warns that the legislation pushes America deeper into a debt spiral that could crash credit markets and destabilize the global economy.

The bill’s $4.5 trillion in tax cuts and defense spending will add another $3.4 trillion to the deficit by 2034, per the Congressional Budget Office. Government debt is now projected to hit 130% of GDP within a decade. That’s worse than the US level after World War II.

Dalio didn’t mince words: “Unless this path is soon rectified… big, painful disruptions will likely occur.” His concern? That interest payments will balloon to $2 trillion annually, forcing a mix of inflation, tax hikes, and spending cuts that gut the economy.

The bill also adds $3.3 trillion to the deficit, with Ray Dalio warning it will erode investor confidence and increase financial instability. “This path is unsustainable,” Dalio said.

What’s next

Trump calls it “beautiful.” But to Beijing, it’s miraculous. Friedman put it bluntly: “There are only two political parties in the world today cheering the passage of this bill: Trump’s Republican Party and the Chinese Communist Party.”

On July 4, while Americans celebrated their independence, China may be celebrating something else: the greatest gift Washington has handed it in decades.President Donald Trump’s newly passed “One Big Beautiful Bill”-a sprawling 869-page tax and spending law-does more than enshrine his second-term agenda. It delivers a devastating blow to America’s renewable energy industry at the exact moment artificial intelligence is fueling a global electricity arms race. And it gives President Xi Jinping and China a clear runway to dominate that future.Experts say this may be one of the most self-destructive energy policies in modern history. “It gives handouts to industries of the past while severely damaging industries of the future,” Tesla CEO Elon Musk said. China, meanwhile, is doubling down on solar, wind, and battery power, preparing to lead the next economic era.Friedman warned in the New York Times: “This dog’s breakfast of a bill… is sure to put at risk billions of dollars of investments in renewable energy… and potentially kill the jobs of tens of thousands of US workers.”Texas has quietly become America’s top clean power state.A Texas A&M report showed the state added 2,596 MW of solar, wind, and battery storage in just one quarter, overtaking California for the top spot.Texas grid expert Doug Lewin posted last week that the state added 10,000 megawatts of new power last year, mostly solar-plus-battery. “Brownouts are down,” he said, “and reliability is up.”But under Trump’s bill, future projects will be more expensive, slower to build, and potentially ineligible for tax credits. That means higher costs for utilities-and for families. “Now the electricity will cost consumers a lot more,” Lewin warned.The bill’s energy policies not only conflict with America’s innovation trajectory-they also defy global trends. Saudi Arabia is building solar farms to power AI data centers. Even fossil-fuel giants are investing in green energy for strategic advantage.China is using a different playbook. In 2000, it produced 1,300 terawatt-hours of electricity. Now it generates over 10,000, while the US has only added 500 terawatt-hours in the same time. China’s growth is increasingly coming from wind, solar, hydro, and battery projects-not coal.A Financial Times report from Shanghai described China’s strategic evolution into an “electrostate”-a nation powered by clean electricity and buffered against trade wars and geopolitical shocks, Friedman said in his NYT column.Tariff trouble: Trump’s steel and aluminum tariffs could drive up the cost and delay deployment of gas turbines and renewables even further.AI grid crunch: With AI data centers consuming vast amounts of electricity, grid expansion is urgent. But Trump’s bill delays and obstructs transmission upgrades-slowing economic growth.Job losses: Research firm Energy Innovation projects the bill will increase wholesale electricity prices by 50% by 2035, raise household energy costs by $16 billion annually by 2030, and eliminate or prevent 830,000 renewable jobs.(With inputs from agencies)","President Donald Trump’s newly passed “One Big Beautiful Bill” does more than enshrine his second-term agenda.

China moves to stop ‘involution’

China’s government is stepping in to cool down the fierce price war in its electric vehicle (EV) market, as concerns over oversupply, shrinking margins, and industry instability grow.After years of aggressive industrial policy driving EV adoption, China's electric vehicle market has become the largest in the world. But it now hosts more automakers than the market can sustain, prompting fears of a bubble and unprofitable competition, reported AP.Market leader BYD reported strong sales growth, a 31% jump in the first half of the year to 2.1 million vehicles, but the company’s aggressive pricing strategy has drawn criticism. Nearly half of those sales were pure electric vehicles, with the rest being plug-in hybrids. BYD stopped selling internal combustion engine cars in 2022.On May 23, BYD slashed prices across more than 20 models, setting off a fresh round of EV price cuts in China. That same day, Great Wall Motors Chairman Wei Jianjun warned of unhealthy market dynamics, comparing the situation to the downfall of real estate giant Evergrande.. “The Evergrande in the automobile industry already exists, but it is just yet to explode,” he said.BYD quickly responded, rejecting the comparison. Brand executive Li Yunfei defended the company in a strongly worded social media post, calling the remarks “confusing” and “ridiculous.”Following the dispute, China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology vowed to address what it called “involution” competition, referring to destructive, zero-sum market behavior. Meanwhile, the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers urged fair competition, noting that drastic price cuts had sparked panic across the industry.“That price cut might have been the final straw that irked both competitors and regulators for the ruthlessness that BYD continues to show,” said independent analyst Lei Xing.In June, 17 Chinese automakers, including BYD, pledged to pay suppliers within 60 days, marking a significant shift. Many EV companies have been stretching out payments or issuing IOUs to suppliers — a risky practice that mirrors tactics used by developers like Evergrande before the real estate crash.Will EV demand hold as prices stabilise?Analysts say these government efforts, along with cutbacks on financing deals and warnings against predatory pricing, are meant to stabilize the market and support long-term growth.With overseas sales rising, BYD exported 464,000 vehicles in the first half of 2025, and global tariffs increasing, China’s EV industry faces a turning point at home and abroad.","China's electric vehicle market has become the largest in the world.

Emirates is shifting its strategic focus away from India due to long standing bilateral restrictions that have prevented the airline from expanding its operations in the country.Adnan Kazim, deputy president and chief commercial officer of Emirates, told ET that India, once among the airline’s top five global markets, has now slipped to the top 10. The main reason, he said, is the cap on seat entitlements under the current air services agreement between India and Dubai.As per the agreement, UAE carriers, including Emirates, are allowed a total of 65,000 weekly seats to India, with a reciprocal limit for Indian carriers flying to Dubai. These limits have remained unchanged for over a decade despite a sharp increase in outbound travel from India.""All 171 weekly frequencies we operate to India are flying above 95% seat factor,"" said Kazim as per ET. ""We're spilling traffic. The demand far exceeds the supply.""Due to the inability to expand in India, Emirates is redirecting its growth to other regions. ""We've been growing consistently, year after year, by at least 3-5%,"" Kazim said.""But we've not been able to add a single seat to India since 2014-nearly 11 years.”Emirates has since increased capacity and added destinations in Asia, the Americas, Europe, Africa, and the Middle East. ""That could've been India playing that role... but it's not the case,"" Kazim noted.He said Emirates remains open to partnerships with Indian carriers, but such tie-ups offer limited value unless seat entitlements are increased.""Flights are already full. A partner cannot add much in that situation."" he explained.Kazim also expressed interest in expanding into Tier 2 Indian cities. However, those plans are on hold due to the same restrictions.Pointing to the potential of the Indian market, Kazim highlighted the relatively low international travel volumes. “You're moving about 120 million international passengers with a population of 1.5 billion.

Dollar weakness raises red flags



Trump’s actions adds to uncertainty

The US dollar has dropped more than 10 per cent in the first half of 2025, marking its sharpest six-month decline since 1973, and sparking fresh warnings from economists and currency experts about the potential for heightened financial market volatility.Despite a full rebound in US stock markets, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq recently hitting record highs, the falling dollar and surging long-term treasury yields point to growing investor concerns over the stability of US financial assets. Analysts link the selloff to US President Donald Trump’s unpredictable economic policies and weakening confidence in the federal reserve.""It's US exceptionalism basically falling by the wayside and the rest of the world playing catch-up,"" said Erik Nelson, macro strategist at Wells Fargo, predicting continued dollar depreciation as other global economies catch up, according to AFP.The ICE US dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of major currencies, fell 10.7 per cent through June, its worst start to a year in over five decades.The euro has been a major beneficiary, gaining over 13 per cent this year thanks to Germany’s fiscal spending and ECB rate cuts.Economists say global investors are rethinking their reliance on the dollar as a safe haven currency. Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM US, called the current retreat the start of a “multi-year unwinding” of the dollar’s 14-year bull run.Harvard economist Kenneth Rogoff, author of Our Dollar Your Problem, pointed to a growing trend among central banks in China and other nations to diversify away from the dollar, a trend accelerated by Trump's policies.“I think we'll see a period of a lot of financial volatility, largely centered around the chaos in the United States,"" Rogoff said, citing threats to central bank independence and the rise of populism.The Trump administration has added to the volatility with conflicting signals on monetary and trade policy. Trump has publicly attacked fed chair Jerome Powell, demanding interest rates ""at least two to three points lower,"" and called Powell ""a stupid person.""While treasury secretary Scott Bessent denied aiming for a weak dollar, analysts say the trend fits with the administration’s manufacturing and onshoring strategy.""Lower interest rates and a weaker dollar would enable the US to strengthen its economic self-sufficiency and increase onshoring,"" reported AFP quoting Jason Schenker of Prestige Economics.In April, Trump reversed new tariffs announced just a week earlier after a surge in Treasury yields caused a stock market dip. He later said he had no plans to remove Powell, walking back earlier threats.So far, US equities remain strong, seemingly unaffected by the dollar’s drop. But some experts warn the situation could shift quickly.","US dollar has dropped more than 10 per cent in the first half of 2025, marking its sharpest six-month decline since 1973.

Asian markets showed mixed movement on Friday as investors treaded carefully ahead of a looming US tariff deadline set by President Donald Trump. The uncertainty overshadowed positive cues from Wall Street, where a strong US jobs report lifted major indexes to record highs.Trump told reporters Thursday that he planned to begin sending letters to trading partners detailing new tariffs, as his July 9 deadline approaches. “My inclination is to send a letter out and say what tariff they're going to be paying,” he said, adding that letters could start going out “probably tomorrow, maybe 10 a day.”The move follows his sweeping announcement of new levies on “Liberation Day” in early April, sparking a global rush for trade deals to avoid the tariffs. So far, only Britain and Vietnam have signed agreements, while China has reached a framework deal with Washington to reduce mutual tariffs and ease restrictions on some goods.As negotiations continue, investors worry that countries like Japan, South Korea, India, and Taiwan could soon face higher tariffs. The uncertainty weighed on markets across Asia. Tokyo, Shanghai, Sydney, Wellington, and Jakarta posted small gains, while Hong Kong, Seoul, Singapore, Taipei, and Manila ended lower.Despite these concerns, Wall Street closed strong ahead of the US Independence Day holiday. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq hit fresh record highs after US jobs data showed the economy added 147,000 jobs in June, above expectations, while unemployment fell to 4.1%.However, the upbeat headline figures masked underlying weakness, analysts warned. MUFG said hiring in the private sector appeared to be stalling, with more than 750,000 people having exited the labor force over the past two months. ""We continue to view labour demand as being fundamentally weak relative to the past several years,"" they noted.The labor data reduced expectations of a July interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve. Markets are now pricing in two rate cuts by year-end, the first likely in September.Meanwhile, the passage of Trump’s “Big, Beautiful Bill,” which extends major tax and spending cuts, added to market confusion. While the legislation includes a $5 trillion debt limit increase, preventing a potential US default, it is also projected to add $3 trillion to the national debt.","Tokyo, Shanghai, Sydney, Wellington, and Jakarta posted small gains.

China is the world’s biggest supplier of these materials, producing nearly two-thirds of all rare earths and over 90% of refined output, according to the International Energy Agency.Wang defended the restrictions, saying the materials have both civilian and military uses and that China had the right to control their export. “This is part of our sovereignty,” he said.To ease concerns, China recently proposed creating a “green channel” to make it easier for rare earth exports to the EU, but many companies remain worried about disruptions to supply.Wadephul also raised the issue of China’s ties to Russia and the war in Ukraine, warning against the supply of goods that could support Russia’s military.Wang responded firmly, saying: “We are striving for peace and negotiation. We are not supplying lethal weapons to the parties involved in the conflict.”China says it is neutral in the war, but Western countries argue that Beijing’s trade and diplomatic support has helped Russia continue its offensive.Despite the disagreements, both sides stressed the need for continued cooperation. Wadephul said Germany and China must work together to tackle global problems, even as tensions grow over trade and security.Wang’s visit to Berlin was part of a wider European tour that includes France and Brussels, where he is trying to present China as a stable partner in contrast to the United States under US president Donald Trump’s leadership.","China has required companies to get licences before exporting rare earths.

The United States is expected to have witnessed a further slowdown in job creation during June, with President Donald Trump’s trade tariffs, hiring freeze, and immigration crackdown taking a toll on the labour market.As per news agency AP, the labor department is likely to report that just 115,000 jobs were added last month, down from 139,000 in May, according to estimates by FactSet. If accurate, this would mark the weakest monthly gain since early 2023.The unemployment rate is expected to tick up to 4.3 per cent, its highest level since October 2021, but still relatively low by historical standards. Economists say the US job market has cooled significantly since its post-pandemic boom, with average monthly job gains dropping to 124,000 this year, from 168,000 in 2024 and 400,000 between 2021 and 2023.While interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve in 2022 and 2023 had initially slowed hiring, Trump’s unpredictable trade and immigration policies are now seen as weighing heavily on business confidence.“That whiplash has to stop and it has to stay stopped,” said Susan Spence, chair of the ISM manufacturing survey committee, referring to Trump’s stop-start tariff decisions that have left supply chains rattled and manufacturers hesitant to commit to hiring, as per AP.Private sector data signals further weakness. As per AFP, payroll firm ADP reported a surprise drop of 33,000 jobs in June, the first such decline in recent years, with job cuts mostly in education, health services, and business support roles.“Though layoffs continue to be rare, a hesitancy to hire and a reluctance to replace departing workers led to job losses last month,” said ADP chief economist Nela Richardson, adding that pay growth remained steady for now.Trump’s reimposed tariffs, including a sweeping 10 per cent duty on most US trading partners and higher levies on steel, aluminium, and autos, have increased business costs and stifled hiring. “Weinberg cautioned that companies are likely to respond to the chances of a tariff-induced hike in costs by becoming more aggressive about trimming their workforces,” AFP quoted Carl Weinberg of High Frequency Economics as saying.Some analysts fear this may be the start of a larger pullback.Federal employment also appears to be shrinking. Oxford Economics’ Nancy Vanden Houten expects a 20,000 drop in government jobs in June due to Trump’s hiring freeze, voluntary exits, and pending court rulings on layoffs.Meanwhile, immigration enforcement could be shrinking the overall labour force. In May alone, the workforce shrank by 625,000 people — the sharpest decline in 18 months, as per AP.While the data will be clarified once official numbers are released, economists warn that the slowdown could be deeper than anticipated.“We could be in for a downside surprise,” LPL Financial’s Jeffrey Roach said, cautioning that even if ADP data diverges from official figures, the broader hiring trend appears to be weakening, according to AFP.","The US is expected to have witnessed a further slowdown in job creation during June.

Donald Trump Predicts Major India-US Trade Deal With Lower Tariffs Before July 9 Deadline Ends

How US Trade Deal With Vietnam Will Hit China

World’s Trading Dilemma & China’s Warning

Challenge for China & Its Worry

US President Donald Trump’s trade policies, tariff wars, and moves to seal trade deals with major trading partners in Asia and Europe has China increasingly on the guard - and rightly so! These trade deals could potentially separate Chinese companies from global supply networks, despite the recently announced trade truce between the US and China.US officials are actively negotiating with key trading allies in Asia and Europe before July 9, seeking arrangements that could limit Chinese involvement and address what the US considers unfair trade practices by China.The temporary 90-day suspension by Trump on what he termed ""reciprocal"" tariffs affecting many US trading partners concludes on July 9. These countries risk facing substantially higher tariffs if they fail to establish trade agreements with the US.Many countries are taking steps to maintain positive relations with Washington. Since Trump's tariff announcement in April, Vietnam, Thailand and South Korea have implemented regulations to prevent product rerouting through their territories to the US.Also Read | What is Donald Trump’s net worth? Billionaire US President has a big portfolio of cryptocurrencies, stocks & more - top details South Korean authorities have intensified their efforts against transshipments, noting an increase in such activities. Taiwan's President Lai Ching-te addressed this concern and subsequently introduced regulations requiring all US-destined exports to include legal certification of their Taiwanese origin.President Donald Trump announced on Wednesday a new tariff structure with Vietnam, marking the first such arrangement. According to Trump's social media announcement, Vietnamese exports to the US will face a 20% tariff, while goods identified as being transshipped through the country will incur a 40% charge.This arrangement will affect products containing Chinese components that are either minimally processed in Vietnam or simply routed through the country before reaching the US. This structure reflects similar provisions found in existing US trade agreements with Mexico and Canada.The complete details of the agreement remain undisclosed by the White House, with some aspects possibly still under development. The impact on China's increasing exports to Vietnam is yet to be determined. China's Ministry of Commerce has not yet provided a response to enquiries.India, which is reportedly close to finalising a deal, is discussing ""rules of origin"" requirements. The US is seeking a minimum of 60% local value addition for products to qualify as ""Made in India"" and receive benefits under the agreement. According to Bloomberg News, India is attempting to negotiate this requirement down to approximately 35%.The trade war predicament facing Asia centres on its dual reliance: needing US consumer markets while depending on Chinese manufacturing inputs, according to Alicia Garcia Herrero, Asia-Pacific chief economist at Natixis SA. According to the Bloomberg report, in her recent analysis, she highlighted that Vietnam, Cambodia and Taiwan face particularly high exposure to this situation.Also Read | From ‘dead’ to ‘hottest in world’: Donald Trump calls ‘Big, Beautiful Bill’ the path to US making a ‘fortune’; says America growing out of ‘Biden mess’ For most Asian economies, China represents a more significant trading relationship than the United States. Beijing has issued stern warnings about protecting its interests, with Foreign Minister Wang Yi expected to emphasise this position during his upcoming European diplomatic mission to Brussels, Germany and France.""China firmly opposes any party reaching a deal at the expense of Chinese interests in exchange for so-called tariff reductions,"" said the Ministry of Commerce on Saturday, reiterating previous cautions. ""If this happens, China will never accept it and will resolutely counter it to safeguard its legitimate rights and interests.""According to Bloomberg Economics, Vietnam's trade agreement could trigger retaliatory measures from China.""Beijing has signalled its intention to address arrangements that undermined Chinese interests, and the acceptance of increased tariffs on products 'transshipped' through Vietnam could be considered such a case,"" Bloomberg's Rana Sajedi noted in a research analysis.The United States' potential influence on other nations to strengthen or implement export restrictions on advanced technology poses a significant challenge for Beijing, particularly regarding its acquisition of essential semiconductor manufacturing equipment.In June, Taiwan expanded its restricted entities catalogue to include both Huawei Technologies Co. and Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp., requiring Taiwanese companies to obtain governmental clearance before engaging in business transactions with these firms.The situation extends beyond Asian borders. Europe faces its own complexities in this matter. China's electric vehicle exports predominantly flow to the EU, whilst Chinese investments in the EU and UK reached 10 billion euros ($12 billion) in the previous year, as documented by Rhodium Group.Also Read | US plans ‘economic bunker buster’ bill: Will Donald Trump impose 500% tariff on countries importing oil from Russia? How it may impact India However, commercial relations are becoming strained. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has recently criticised Beijing for its approach to rare earths and magnets, whilst highlighting concerns about Chinese industrial surplus.The European Union's potential agreement with the US has raised significant concerns in Beijing, particularly regarding provisions similar to those in the British-American deal, which encompassed supply chain security, export regulations and ownership guidelines for industries including steel, aluminium and pharmaceuticals. Although China was not explicitly mentioned, Beijing issued an unusual public critique of the agreement, viewing it as a direct challenge, according to the Financial Times.""China is clearly worried that the EU will accept the same wording as the UK did on export controls,"" said Joerg Wuttke, a partner at the Albright Stonebridge Group in Washington and former president of the EU Chamber of Commerce in China. ""They are pushing the EU not to do this, and the US is pushing the EU to do it.""The EU and US aim to establish an agreement before July 9, when American authorities plan to implement a 50 per cent tariff on virtually all European products. The EU considers the US relationship more vital, as European exports to America exceed twice the value of those to China, providing the US with substantial negotiating power.The primary challenge facing Beijing lies in the potential consolidation of these initiatives into a broader transformation - beyond US-led restrictions on Chinese exports to a fundamental restructuring of global commerce centred on 'trusted' supply networks, potentially marginalising China. During his Southeast Asian tour earlier this year, President Xi Jinping called for regional unity as an ""Asian family,"" cautioning against commercial fragmentation.Also Read | Not just Apple iPhones!

In 2023, it suspended Japanese seafood imports after perceiving criticism from G7 meetings in Japan.

But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume.

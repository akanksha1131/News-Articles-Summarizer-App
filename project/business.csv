‘Trump’s Team In Serious Discussions With India’: White House As India-US Trade Talks Continue





Why is Russian crude oil idling on the sea?

Economic impact of sanctions

India, China look away from Russian oil

Can the world permanently ignore Russian oil?





Donald Trump’s latest sanctions on Russian crude oil firms appears to have had the intended impact - at least as of now. Refiners are reportedly unwilling to pick up Russian crude oil from ships, wary of US sanctions.According to a Bloomberg report, seaborne crude exports from Russia have seen a significant decline, marking the steepest drop since January 2024, as recent US sanctions caused main purchasers to distance themselves from Russian oil.The discharge of cargo has seen a more substantial decrease compared to loading activities, resulting in increased oil volumes at sea.Data from vessel tracking compiled by Bloomberg indicates that the four-week average volumes from Russian ports reached 3.58 million barrels per day until November 2, showing a reduction of approximately 190,000 from the adjusted figures for the period ending October 26.The four-week average provides a more accurate representation of underlying patterns compared to the more fluctuating weekly statistics, which also decreased.The decline in oil movement impacted Moscow's oil revenue, which dropped to its lowest point since August, following US restrictions on transactions with Russia's leading exporters, Rosneft PJSC and Lukoil PJSC.While Russian exporters continue loading crude onto vessels, refineries show reduced willingness to transfer the cargo to their storage facilities.This has resulted in Russian crude at sea increasing to over 380 million barrels, with a rise of 27 million barrels, or 8% from early September, according to Bloomberg's tanker-tracking information.Refineries in China, India and Turkey are currently suspending purchases of sanctioned shipments and exploring different supply options, according to the report.India, China and Turkey dominate Russia's seaborne crude exports, accounting for over 95% of the total volume. Any substantial reduction in their purchases cannot be easily offset.Russia is likely to continue loading vessels even if they remain in floating storage, making offshore oil reserves an increasingly crucial indicator of the sanctions' effectiveness.During the week ending November 2, vessel-tracking data and port-agent reports indicated that 21.11 million barrels of Russian crude were loaded onto 26 tankers. This represented a decrease from the previous week's revised figure of 26.41 million barrels transported by 34 vessels.The daily average shipments dropped to 3.02 million barrels, reaching the lowest level in 10 weeks during the period ending November 2. Additionally, three Kebco grade shipments from Kazakhstan were dispatched, with two from Ust-Luga and one from Novorossiysk. All regions reported reduced shipments, except De Kastri, which maintained consistent flows from the Sakhalin 1 project.Leading European oil company executives have cautioned that global oil supplies will be affected by restrictions on dealings with Russia's four largest crude exporters, potentially limiting any surplus in the coming year.The four-week average gross value of Russian exports decreased by approximately $90 million to $1.36 billion weekly in the 28-day period ending November 2, affected by declining quantities and prices.The export prices showed notable reductions. Baltic and Black Sea Urals crude decreased by about $0.60 per barrel to $51.42 and $51.79 respectively. Pacific ESPO crude prices reduced by $0.80, averaging $59.20 per barrel, staying under the G-7 price cap of $60 for two consecutive weeks. Indian delivery prices also decreased by $0.60 to $62.13 per barrel, as reported by Argus Media.The weekly export value for the seven days to November 2 averaged $1.15 billion, showing a 27% reduction from the revised figures of the period ending October 26.Major Indian refineries, which typically purchase approximately 1 million barrels of Russian crude daily, are temporarily halting acquisitions until alternative arrangements can be established.This is anticipated to affect deliveries in December and January, with loadings scheduled to begin this month at Russian ports. India's government-operated refineries are exploring options to maintain some cargo receipts from smaller suppliers rather than Russia's sanctioned energy corporations.Chinese refineries are implementing similar restrictions. Government-controlled entities Sinopec and PetroChina Co. have withdrawn from some Russian cargo agreements following US sanctions, the Bloomberg report said.According to Rystad Energy AS, this cautious approach could impact up to 45% of China's total seaborne crude imports from Russia, approximately 400,000 barrels daily. This might affect Russia's primary ESPO grade, dispatched from Kozmino port in the Pacific, which typically reaches northern Chinese refineries after a brief sea journey.Turkish refiners, ranking third globally in Russian crude imports, are now reducing their purchases and diversifying their supply sources to include Iraq, Libya, Saudi Arabia and Kazakhstan.Some industry experts believe this shift is not permanent. ""Down the line, you will see that more and more of the disrupted Russian oil, one way or another, finds its way to the market,"" Gunvor Group Chief Executive Officer Torbjörn Törnqvist was quoted as saying by Bloomberg. ""It always does somehow.""In a separate development, Russian crude processing showed an uptick in the last week of October, with facilities increasing production following seasonal maintenance and Ukrainian drone attacks. However, operations are expected to decline this week following another strike, the seventh this year, targeting Rosneft's Saratov facility.Despite significant declines in crude shipments to China and India, substantial volumes remain on vessels without declared destinations, suggesting potential adjustments to these patterns. Vessels increasingly withhold their final destination details until traversing the Arabian Sea, whilst some maintain this ambiguity even during discharge, the Bloomberg report said.The four-week period to November 2 saw flows to Chinese ports reduce to 970,000 barrels daily, whilst Indian-bound shipments decreased to 940,000 barrels per day from a revised 1.16 million barrels daily in the period to October 26. Additionally, vessels carrying over 1.3 million barrels per day have yet to declare their final destinations.Approximately 1.2 million barrels daily originate from Russian western ports indicating Port Said or Suez Canal destinations, or Pacific ports without specific delivery points. A further 140,000 barrels daily are on vessels without any destination signals.Historically, these shipments predominantly reached India or China, however, strengthened US sanctions might keep these supplies at sea unless Russian sellers develop alternative arrangements.","Russia's seaborne crude exports have seen a significant decline, marking the steepest drop since January 2024. Refiners in China, India and Turkey are currently suspending purchases of sanctioned shipments and exploring different supply options. The decline in oil movement impacted Moscow's oil revenue, which dropped to its lowest point since August.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125105394,imgsize-89784,width-400,resizemode-4/russia-crude-oil.jpg"

Mounting pressure on travel and welfare

Political stalemate over healthcare





The United States has entered uncharted territory as the ongoing government shutdown surpassed all previous records, becoming the longest-ever on Wednesday, exceeding the 35-day benchmark set during Donald Trump ’s first term. The stalemate—rooted in a bitter dispute over healthcare spending—has left federal agencies shuttered, key welfare programmes suspended, and millions of Americans bracing for deepening disruptions.Since Congress failed to approve funding beyond September 30, large parts of the federal government have ceased operations. The impact is widening each day, with food assistance for millions halted and roughly 1.4 million federal employees—including air traffic controllers, TSA officers, and park wardens.The administration has issued fresh warnings of widespread travel chaos if the deadlock persists. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy cautioned that extended staff shortages could soon lead to “mass flight delays, cancellations, and even airspace closures.”The American Automobile Association (AAA) projects record Thanksgiving air travel this year, with 5.8 million Americans expected to fly during the November 27 holiday. Yet, over 60,000 air traffic controllers and TSA officers are currently unpaid, raising fears of absenteeism similar to 2019, when sick calls from unpaid workers effectively forced an end to the previous shutdown.Meanwhile, the White House has warned of possible benefit suspensions, including partial disruptions to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Programme (SNAP), though it pledged to comply with court mandates to distribute emergency payments.At the heart of the deadlock lies a dispute over healthcare funding. Democrats are demanding that Congress address expiring insurance subsidies before reopening the government, while Republicans insist operations resume first. Despite signs of movement from a few centrist Democrats—who have proposed a framework to curb insurance costs—party leadership on both sides remains entrenched.Trump has ruled out compromise, telling CBS News that he would “not be extorted.” His administration has also signalled readiness to tighten spending on progressive programmes, further hardening partisan divides.As the shutdown enters its sixth week with no resolution in sight, economists warn of growing damage to the nation’s economy and institutions—making this not only the longest government shutdown in US history but also one of its most consequential.Food assistance, child care support, and numerous other government services have been severely disrupted, while hundreds of thousands of federal employees have either been furloughed or required to work without pay.","US government shutdown becomes longest-ever on Wednesday, exceeding 35-day benchmark set during Donald Trump ’s first term.

'Unfair, Unjustified': Piyush Goyal Exposes US Tariff Logic, Says India Won’t Accept One-Sided Rules

Trump’s tariffs face SC test

Trump administration expresses confidence





US President Donald Trump ’s reciprocal tariffs, that have shaken the world economy, are facing their final test with the Supreme Court hearing cases that question the measure’s legality.Trump has sought the Supreme Court's support to maintain tariffs, which he has utilised as a crucial economic and diplomatic instrument. An adverse ruling would represent a significant shift for the court, which has previously supported his extensive measures through interim decisions across various domains, including immigration enforcement, dismissal of federal agency officials, and restrictions on transgender military service.Trump employed the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to implement tariffs on virtually all US trading partners. This legislation permits presidential regulation of commerce during national emergencies. He was the first president to utilise IEEPA for this specific purpose.According to a Reuters reoport, Justices of the US Supreme Court expressed scepticism on Wednesday regarding the validity of President Donald Trump's broad tariff policies in a case that could affect global trade and serves as a significant assessment of Trump's authority.Both conservative and liberal justices vigorously questioned the Trump administration's legal representative about the legitimacy of using a 1977 emergency-focused legislation as justification for Trump's tariff implementation, considering whether this action infringed upon congressional jurisdiction.Some conservative justices, however, also emphasised presidential authority in foreign relations, indicating a possible division within the court on this matter. The current court composition stands at a 6-3 conservative advantage.The session, which extended beyond 2-1/2 hours, addressed appeals from the administration following lower court decisions that deemed Trump's application of the relevant law excessive. The challenges came from affected businesses and 12 US states, predominantly under Democratic leadership.Conservative Chief Justice John Roberts addressed US Solicitor General D. John Sauer, the administration's representative, saying, ""the imposition of taxes on Americans, and that has always been the core power of Congress.""The implementation of tariffs, which are essentially import duties, could generate substantial revenue amounting to trillions of dollars for the United States in the coming ten years. Congress holds the constitutional authority to levy taxes and tariffs.Chief Justice Roberts indicated the possibility of applying the ""major questions"" doctrine, which necessitates explicit congressional authorisation for executive branch decisions having significant economic and political implications.""The justification is being used for a power to impose tariffs on any product, from any country, in any amount, for any length of time. I'm not suggesting it's not there, but it does seem like that's major authority, and the basis for that claim seems to be a misfit,"" Roberts said.The ""major questions"" doctrine was previously utilised by the Supreme Court to invalidate significant policies implemented by Trump's Democratic predecessor Joe Biden.Justice Amy Coney Barrett questioned Sauer regarding his assertion that IEEPA's provisions, which grant presidents emergency authority to regulate importation, encompass tariffs.Barrett questioned Sauer about historical precedents where the specific phrase 'regulate importation' was used to grant tariff-imposing authority.IEEPA authorises presidential action during ""an unusual and extraordinary threat"" in national emergencies, traditionally used for enemy sanctions or asset freezing.Sauer explained that Trump identified US trade deficits as a critical economic and security threat, with tariffs facilitating trade negotiations. He warned that dismantling these agreements ""would expose us to ruthless trade retaliation by far more aggressive countries and drive America from strength to failure with ruinous economic and national security consequences.""Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson emphasised that IEEPA was created to restrict, not enhance, presidential powers.""It's pretty clear that Congress was trying to constrain the emergency powers of the president,"" Jackson said according to the Reuters report.During the proceedings, Sauer emphasised presidential authority in international relations, contending that the ""major questions"" doctrine was not relevant in this situation.Justice Brett Kavanaugh displayed potential support for Trump's position by challenging the notion of unprecedented action. He referenced President Richard Nixon's implementation of a global tariff under IEEPA's precursor legislation in the 1970s, which contained comparable provisions regarding import regulation.""That's a good example for you,"" Kavanaugh remarked to Sauer.The Supreme Court has historically granted substantial latitude to presidential foreign policy decisions. Chief Justice Roberts highlighted this whilst questioning Neal Katyal, the lawyer representing private business challengers, noting Trump's tariffs' effectiveness in negotiating trade agreements.Between February 4 and September 23, the IEEPA-based tariffs collected an estimated $89 billion, according to US Customs and Border Protection agency data.""Sure, the tariffs are a tax, and that's a core power of Congress, but they are a foreign-facing tax, right? And foreign affairs is a core power of the executive,"" Roberts stated to Katyal.Justice Neil Gorsuch's line of questioning indicated his concern that Sauer's assertions about presidential foreign affairs authority could potentially compromise the Constitution's separation of powers between executive and legislative branches.""What would prohibit Congress from just abdicating all responsibility to regulate foreign commerce - or for that matter, declare war - to the president?"" Gorsuch enquired.US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent attended Wednesday's proceedings and later expressed strong confidence on ""Kudlow"" programme after observing the arguments. He indicated that alternative legal mechanisms would be employed to maintain Trump's tariffs if the Court rules unfavourably.Trump's additional tariffs, implemented under different legislation, remain outside this case's scope.Despite the Supreme Court's usual practice of deliberating for months after hearings, the Trump administration has requested swift action, though the decision timeline remains uncertain.","US President Donald Trump’s reciprocal tariffs, that have shaken the world economy, are facing their final test with the Supreme Court hearing cases that question the measure's legality.

Asian shares gained on Thursday, recovering some of the previous session’s sharp losses as investor sentiment improved following upbeat US jobs data and a rebound on Wall Street.According to news agency AFP, the rally came after figures from payrolls firm ADP showed that US private sector employment jumped more than expected in the past month, easing concerns over a slowdown in the world’s largest economy.Major markets across the Asia-Pacific region traded higher. Japan’s Nikkei 225 rose 1.1 per cent to 50,768.89, while South Korea’s Kospi inched close to the flatline after an earlier rise.As per CNBC, shares of chip-related firms such as Advantest and Disco Corp gained 3.7 per cent and 4.6 per cent respectively, while SoftBank, which tumbled 10 per cent on Wednesday, recovered 1.5 per cent.Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index climbed 1.1 per cent to 26,220.02, with Chinese markets also edging up as Shanghai’s Composite gained 0.6 per cent.The Australian S&P/ASX 200 added 0.28 per cent.Meanwhile, newly listed Chinese autonomous vehicle firms WeRide and Pony.ai fell over 12 per cent and nearly 8 per cent, respectively, in their Hong Kong debut.Investors were also monitoring developments in Washington, where AFP said the US Supreme Court justices appeared sceptical about US President Donald Trump’s use of emergency powers to impose sweeping tariffs, which had drawn billions in customs revenue.On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 0.48 per cent higher, the S&P 500 rose 0.37 per cent, and the Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.65 per cent, buoyed by renewed optimism in artificial intelligence-linked stocks.In commodities, oil prices were largely flat after falling to two-week lows in the previous session amid concerns of weaker demand and growing global supply.Brent crude inched up 2 cents to $63.54 a barrel, while West Texas Intermediate held steady at $59.60.As per news agency, analysts at Capital Economics said downward pressure on oil prices is likely to persist, forecasting prices to average $60 per barrel by end-2025.Despite Thursday’s recovery, analysts cautioned that high valuations in technology shares and subdued energy demand could continue to test market stability in the weeks ahead.","Major markets across the Asia-Pacific region traded higher.

Citigroup has a buy rating on Bharti Airtel with the target price at Rs 2,225. Analysts said the telecom services major had a steady July Sept quarter (Q2FY26), with India mobile, homes, and business segments all modestly above expectations. They said India mobile revenue and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) grew 2.5-4% on the quarter (QoQ) that was ahead of estimates, with slightly higher ARPUs offsetting slightly lower subscriber additions. Homes revenue and EBITDA both grew ~8.5%, both ahead of estimates, driven by robust subscriber additions. Airtel’s business revenue growth normalised to 4% on the quarter. They also said the company’s 32% QoQ increase in India (ex-Indus) capex was a surprise.Nomura has a buy rating on Titan with the target price at Rs 4,275. Analysts said the company’s Q2FY26 sales were strong and were largely in line with the pre-quarter update. However, margins were a bit lower on the year (YoY) but strong festive demand could drive an improvement in outlook. Its jewellery sales were in line though margins were a bit lower.Titan also reported a 13% growth in sales of watches, a little better than the pre-quarterly update of 12%. Its eyecare sales grew at 8.5% YoY, which was in line with the pre-quarter update. Titan also reported a 34% YoY growth in sales for its emerging businesses.Morgan Stanley has an overweight rating on Ambuja Cements with the target price at Rs 650. Analysts said the cement major’s revenues were in line with estimates with volumes and realizations largely in-line. EBITDA/ton was at Rs 1,060, ahead of the brokerage’s estimates. Under exceptionals, the company recognised losses aggregating Rs 220 crore to account for outstanding government grant, Rs 1,700 crore tax reversals. The company also upped its FY28 capacity target from about 140 million ton to about 155 million ton, led by debottlenecking.Macquarie has an outperform rating on Westlife Foodworld with the target price at Rs 750. Analysts said Q2FY26 EBITDA was below their and the market’s consensus estimates. The company is investing for growth while a pick-up in demand was the key. They also said limited signs of an industry recovery remain a concern.Jefferies has a buy rating on Ajanta Pharma with the target price at Rs 3,320, up from Rs 3120. Analysts said Ajanta Pharma’s Sept quarter numbers beat estimates and the outlook for the company remains strong. They said FY26 guidance pointed towards continued strength in the USA and increased sales growth in Africa.

Nat'l gold policy needed to contain losses: SBI Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/natl-gold-policy-needed-to-contain-losses-sbi-report/articleshow/125120769.cms,"



Mumbai: A State Bank of India research report has called for a long-term national gold policy that defines gold's role, as money or as a commodity, and aligns it with broader financial reforms. The report said such a framework should link to India's plans for capital account convertibility and encourage investment through the monetisation of idle gold.It added that the policy must harmonise how gold is treated in national income accounts, the balance of payments, and capital account to eliminate inconsistencies in accounting practices.According to SBI's economic research department, high domestic demand for gold and India's heavy import dependence with imports accounting for around 86% of total supply has created persistent pressure on the current account deficit. The increase in international price of gold is closely tied to rupee depreciation with the rupee coming under pressure every time gold prices rise because of heavy imports. The Govt also faces a fiscal loss of about Rs 93,284 crore on outstanding sovereign gold bonds, following a sharp rise in gold prices. These challenges are worsened by the lack of a comprehensive long-term policy to integrate gold's treatment across accounting frameworks.To reduce smuggling and deepen the formal market, earlier reports proposed liberalizing gold and silver imports, including easing rules for NRIs. They also suggested introducing forward trading to allow price hedging.","State Bank of India research report has called for a long-term national gold policy. The report said such a framework should link to India's plans for capital account convertibility. It added that the policy must harmonise how gold is treated in national income accounts, balance of payments, and capital account.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125120786,imgsize-713363,width-400,resizemode-4/lk-18.jpg"
Say cheers! India tops alcohol growth in H1,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/say-cheers-india-tops-alcohol-growth-in-h1/articleshow/125120704.cms,"



SALT LAKE CITY India has recorded the highest growth in total beverage alcohol (TBA) consumption among 20 global markets for the third consecutive first half-year period, according to data shared exclusively with TOI. As per global alcohol-focused industry research firm IWSR, TBA volume in India grew 7% year-on-year during the January-June period to over 440 million 9-litre cases. A 9-litre case, IWSR's standard measurement, equals 12 standard 750 ml bottles.Within spirits, Indian whisky remained the largest segment, with volumes rising 7% year-on-year to more than 130 million 9-litre cases. Vodka grew 10%, rum 2%, and gin and genever 3%. ""Indian whisky remains the dominant growth engine for the spirits category in India, driven by improving quality, an expanding consumer base, and favourable economic conditions. Spirits at the higher end of the standard price band and above are outperforming value spirits, reflecting the quality uplift across domestic distillers,"" said Sarah Campbell, IWSR head of research-Asia-Pacific. India's position at the top is based on percentage growth in TBA volume among all 20 markets IWSR tracks in its half-year report.The other markets include China, the US, Brazil, Russia, Mexico, Germany, Japan, the UK, Spain, South Africa, Italy, France, Poland, the Philippines, Thailand, Australia, Canada, Colombia, and the Netherlands. IWSR's long-term forecast places India on track to become the fifth-largest alcohol market globally by volume. According to its projections, India is expected to overtake Japan in 2027 and Germany in 2033. This long-range forecast covers 31 markets. The four markets projected to remain ahead are China, the United States, Brazil, and Mexico.Premium-and-above alcohol segments in India also outpaced overall growth, rising 8% by both volume and value in the first half of the current calendar year.Ready-to-drink beverages grew the fastest among major categories at 11%, followed by beer at 7%, spirits at 6%, while wine remained flat. Irish whiskey rose 23%, agave-based spirits 19%, while US whiskey declined 10%, IWSR data showed. ""India is increasingly one of the most important global markets for the beverage alcohol industry,"" Campbell said, adding that IWSR attributed the rise to consistent demand growth across categories and steady premiumisation trends. Scotch malts lost some share to Indian single malts., while blended Scotch remained stable. Brandy saw more flavoured variants and consolidation in southern states, and flavoured vodka continued to grow.","India has recorded the highest growth in total beverage alcohol (TBA) consumption among 20 global markets for the third consecutive first half-year period.

AUCKLAND: A fair and balanced free trade agreement (FTA) with New Zealand can unlock new opportunities and benefit people on both sides, commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal said on Wednesday.Goyal, who is on a four-day trip to New Zealand, met his counterpart Tod McClay, and the business community in Auckland. This is the first visit by an Indian commerce minister in nearly 14 years and comes as the two countries launched a fresh round of negotiations.New Zealand's prime minister Christopher Luxon also joined Goyal at a function organised by the Indian diaspora and highlighted the growing economic and strategic ties between the two nations.Goyal said that significant progress has been made in the talks of the planned FTA with New Zealand and hoped that deal would be sealed soon. He did not give a timeline.The minister also said that India has never compromised on the interest of farmers, fishermen, vishwakarmas and MSMEs. ""We consistently protect the interest of the vulnerable sections. We consistently ensure that our priorities remain in the best interest of the people of India,"" said Goyal.Negotiators from India and New Zealand have begun their fourth round of talks to bridge the gaps that still remain.Goyal also said that India can look at collaboration in farming technologies, such as dairy machinery, as New Zealand has a strong presence in that segment.Asked whether more rounds of talks would be needed for the deal to be stamped, Goyal said, ""We may not need many more rounds as significant progress has been made"".Goyal also said that several sectors hold huge potential between India and New Zealand to deepen cooperation, including in defence, agriculture, space, education, tourism, movies and sports.In March, India and New Zealand decided to relaunch negotiations for a free trade after a gap of 10 years, a move aimed at deepening economic ties between the two countries against the backdrop of geopolitical tensions.India has stitched several FTAs with key partners, including the UK, and deal with the European Union is expected soon.

Microfin sector shrinks even as loan tickets rise,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/microfin-sector-shrinks-even-as-loan-tickets-rise/articleshow/125120523.cms,"



MUMBAI: The microfinance industry continued to shrink in the second quarter of FY26 even as asset quality improved. As of Sept 2025, the gross loan portfolio stood at Rs 34.56 lakh crore, a decline of 3.8% quarter-on-quarter and 16.5% year-on-year. The moderation reflected the sector's ongoing shift to risk-based lending and tighter portfolio controls following the RBI's 2022 framework.According to CRIF High Mark - MicroLend Sep'25 Report, the contraction in loan portfolios coincided with a fall in both active loans and the customer base, which declined 6.3% and 6.1% respectively during the quarter. Lenders have slowed new borrower acquisition while focusing on portfolio quality and compliance with revised norms.Even as the number of new loans dropped, the total value of disbursements rose 6.5% quarter-on-quarter to Rs 60,900 crore. This was driven by higher average ticket sizes, which rose 8.7% from the previous quarter and 21.3% from a year earlier to Rs 60,900. NBFC-MFIs accounted for the largest share of new disbursements at 41.6%, while small finance banks recorded the fastest growth, with disbursement value rising 24.7%.The shift in origination patterns was marked by larger loans. The Rs 50,000-Rs 80,000 category accounted for 40% of total loans, becoming the dominant segment. Loans above Rs 1 lakh more than doubled their share year-on-year to 15%, driven largely by banks and NBFCs, whose originations in this bracket rose 44% and 25.1% respectively. Smaller ticket loans between Rs 30,000 and Rs 50,000 saw their share fall to 25.6% from 42.2% a year earlier.Portfolio quality indicators improved in early-stage delinquencies. The share of loans overdue by up to 180 days fell to 5.99% in Sept 2025 from 7.06% in June. Early delinquencies also eased, with the 1-30 day and 31-90 day overdue buckets showing steady improvement. However, late-stage stress remained elevated, with the 180-day-plus bucket, including write-offs, rising to 15.3%. The industry said part of this rise reflected legacy stress and differing treatment of written-off accounts among lenders.The quality of recent originations continued to improve, with lower delinquency levels observed in newer loan vintages. Collection efficiency, measured through the net forward flow ratio, also rose across all delinquency categories between Aug and Sept, suggesting improved repayment behaviour.Borrower exposure patterns showed a shift toward consolidation. The share of customers with up to three lender associations rose to 91.2% in Sept 2025 from 83.1% a year earlier. Borrowers with outstanding credit of up to Rs 1 lakh accounted for 68.5% of the total portfolio, while only 2.3% had exposures above Rs 2 lakh-the regulatory guardrail for borrower indebtedness. Risk levels declined across all exposure categories, particularly for loans exceeding Rs 1 lakh.","As of Sept 2025, the gross loan portfolio stood at Rs 34.56 lakh crore.

Mumbai: State Bank of India expects corporate credit growth to accelerate in the coming quarters, supported by a Rs 7 lakh crore pipeline of loans. Chairman CS Setty said the bank anticipates at least 10% growth in corporate lending over the next two quarters, even as corporates continue to make large pre-payments.Setty said repayments in the second quarter were driven by equity issuances and IPOs, with some corporates using funds to repay loans or refinance through bonds. ""A couple of airports were like that,"" he said, adding that some govt entities also made large repayments after receiving funds upfront. The chairman answered analyst queries in a post-results meeting.The bank's domestic advances grew 12.3% y-o-y to Rs 37.4 lakh crore as of Sept 30, 2025. Following RBI's recent monetary policy and reforms, SBI has raised its credit growth target to 12-14%.Lending to infrastructure sectors fell 3%, reflecting steep declines in constituent sectors telecommunications (-27.9%), roads and ports (-11.3%), and other infrastructure (-13.6%). Credit to tourism and hotels also dropped 14.3%. However, lending to engineering surged 32%, while other industries grew 17.2%, services 16.8%, and home loans 15.2%. Auto, retail, and agriculture loans rose 9.6%, 13.4%, and 14.2%, respectively.Setty said the Rs 7 lakh crore corporate loan pipeline has stayed steady across quarters, with half already sanctioned and awaiting disbursement. ""The remaining half is in discussions,"" he said. ""This includes both working capital lines and term loans. The new projects are largely from the private sector, though some are from the public sector."" He said part of the pipeline would materialise this year, with some spillover into the next year.On the new guidelines allowing funding of mergers and acquisitions, Setty commented that the bank has been funding cross-border acquisitions and might also look at collaborating with foreign banks.""Working capital utilisation has risen, signaling recovery in consumption demand. The corporate bond shift is cyclical. We expect sustained double-digit system-wide growth,"" said Setty. He added that there was a sharp pick up in auto loans after the GST cut which came into effect only in Sept 22.""With the pipeline we have, there's visibility of at least 10% corporate credit growth in the next two quarters,"" Setty said. ""The negative growth has been reversed, corporate loan has turned positive this quarter with 7% growth and we look forward to a better performance in the third quarter.""Retail credit remains a key growth driver. ""Home loans at 15% is good growth,"" Setty said. ""We have a large catchment, and customer acquisition is robust,"" he said, adding that the home loan portfolio should stabilise at 14-15% growth.The bank is also emphasising express credit-its unsecured personal loan product. Setty said demand for express credit had been affected as borrowers moved to gold loans, attracted by higher ticket sizes and lower rates. ""As gold prices moderate, we hope express credit will grow,"" he said. ""Our sanctions and disbursements have been significant-it's a high-churning product that requires continuous customer acquisition. ""","The bank's domestic advances grew 12.3% y-o-y to Rs 37.4 lakh crore as of Sept 30, 2025. SBI has raised its credit growth target to 12-14%.

Dangers Of AI: Is ChatGPT Quietly Harming Your Mental Health? | Global Pulse





NEW DELHI: A high-powered government committee on artificial intelligence (AI) has said India does not require a separate law to regulate AI at this moment as a large number of risks associated with the cutting-edge technological leap can be handled by existing laws. It did, however, highlight the need to create an India-specific risk assessment framework based on empirical evidence of harm.The 'India AI Governance Guidelines' also highlighted the need for the industry to adopt ""voluntary measures"" with respect to privacy and security, while creating a grievance redressal mechanism to enable reporting of AI-related harms.The guidelines were announced by top functionaries of govt, which included principal scientific adviser Ajay Kumar Sood and IT secretary S Krishnan and committee members Abhishek Singh (additional secretary of IT ministry) and Balaraman Ravindran (IIT Madras professor).The committee's guidelines said, ""Existing laws (for example on IT, data protection, consumer protection and statutory civil and criminal codes, etc.) can be used to govern AI applications. Therefore, at this stage, a separate law to regulate AI is not needed given the current assessment of risks. However, timely and consistent enforcement of applicable laws is required to build trust and mitigate harm.""However, Krishnan said govt will legislate if the requirement is felt.""... let me again assert that if the need arises for legislation or regulation, govt will not be found wanting.""The guidelines advocate the adoption of ""balanced, agile and flexible frameworks"" that support innovation while minimising risks. ""Review current laws, identify regulatory gaps in relation to AI systems, and address them with targeted amendments.""They committee said goal of the guidelines is to encourage innovation and AI adoption, while protecting individuals and society from the risk of harm. ""India's approach in general is to govern applications of AI by empowering the relevant sectoral regulators, and not to regulate the underlying technology itself."" However, the guidelines note the risks to society and citizens from the onslaught of the new technology. ""Mitigating the risks of AI to individuals and society is a key pillar of the governance framework.""The committee seeks creation of a grievance redressal mechanism to enable reporting of AI-related harms and ensure resolution of such issues within a reasonable timeframe.""Publish transparency reports that evaluate the risk of harm to individuals and society in the Indian context. If they contain any sensitive or proprietary information, the reports should be shared confidentially with relevant regulators."" Regarding accountability, the committee suggests a ""graded liability system"" based on the function performed, level of risk, and whether due diligence was observed.","A high-powered government committee on artificial intelligence has said India does not require a separate law to regulate AI.

Wall Street stocks found stability on Wednesday following stronger-than-anticipated US employment data, even as Asian markets posted sharp declines and worries about an AI-fueled valuation surge weighed on the tech-heavy Nasdaq.US private sector employment increased by 42,000 in October, ADP reported, bouncing back from a September decline of 29,000 jobs. The gain nearly doubled forecasts from economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires and The Wall Street Journal, reported AFP.Analysts say these ADP numbers could draw fresh focus as one of the few recent economic indicators, shaping investor expectations around whether the Federal Reserve might cut interest rates in December.The major US indices opened the session broadly unchanged. The so-called Magnificent Seven tech companies continued to face selling pressure, with both Amazon and Apple retreating roughly 1 per cent.O’Hare highlighted semiconductor firm AMD, which is positioning itself as a key player in AI chips and recently reported stronger-than-expected third-quarter earnings. “Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) may be the tell on whether that approach will shine yet again or lose some of its luster,” he said.Shares in AMD opened down 2.7 percent.He added, “If AMD can fight back, chances are other growth stocks will follow,"" as quoted by AFP.Global equities have climbed this year as massive investment poured into companies linked to artificial intelligence, including US giants Nvidia, Amazon, and Apple, alongside Asian firms such as Samsung and Alibaba. However, despite robust earnings, market participants are increasingly cautious about chasing ever-higher stock prices, as most capital remains concentrated in a limited number of large-name firms.Investor sentiment was also pressured by the US government shutdown, which on Wednesday became the longest in American history, exceeding the previous 35-day record set during President Donald Trump’s first term. The administration warned of potential travel disruptions during the upcoming holiday period and threatened Americans’ benefits to push for a resolution. A total of 1.4 million federal employees, including air-traffic controllers and park rangers, are either furloughed or working without pay.At around 1430 GMT, New York’s main indices were largely flat, with the Dow at 47,078.11 points, the S&P 500 at 6,770.83, and the Nasdaq Composite up less than 0.1 percent at 23,362.57.

Danish pharmaceutical giant Novo Nordisk, the maker of obesity drugs Ozempic and Wegovy, lowered its 2025 sales outlook for the fourth time this year on Wednesday after reporting tepid third-quarter results.The company, which appointed Mike Doustdar as CEO in August, now expects full-year sales growth of 8 to 11 per cent, down from a previous forecast of 8 to 14 per cent. Novo Nordisk said the downgrade “reflects lowered growth expectations” for its diabetes and obesity treatments.Amid these challenges, Novo Nordisk announced plans to cut 9,000 jobs. The company is also engaged in a bidding war with Pfizer to acquire US weight-loss treatment specialist Metsera, reported AFP.Novo Nordisk initially made an unsolicited $6 billion bid for Metsera last week, topping Pfizer’s earlier offer. Pfizer countered with $8 billion, prompting Novo Nordisk to raise its bid to $10 billion.Revenue for the third quarter rose 5 per cent to 75 billion kroner ($11.5 billion), but fell short of expectations. Net profit declined 27 per cent to 20 billion kroner, in line with analyst forecasts, according to FactSet.The company said earnings were affected by one-off restructuring costs linked to its “company-wide transformation”, aimed at streamlining operations and boosting growth.Doustdar said, “Our company-wide transformation has already driven operational efficiencies, and we have a renewed focus that can deliver a range of potential treatment options that will serve millions more patients, mainly in obesity.”Novo Nordisk’s weight-loss injections, once a major driver of its share price, have faced increasing competition in the US. Pharmacies were allowed to produce copycat versions of Ozempic and Wegovy during shortages, slowing growth.Sales of Ozempic increased 13 per cent between January and September 2025 compared to the same period last year, a slower pace than previous years. Wegovy sales grew 54 per cent in the first nine months of 2025.The company’s share of total GLP-1 prescriptions in the US was 45.1 per cent in the third quarter, but its share of new prescriptions fell to 38.8 per cent.Doustdar said, “We aim to accelerate on all fronts to be able to compete better in dynamic and increasingly competitive markets.”","Novo Nordisk, maker of obesity drugs Ozempic and Wegovy, lowered its 2025 sales outlook for the fourth time this year.

President Donald Trump called Democrats “kamikaze” as he blamed them for the US government shutdown entering its sixth week on Wednesday, becoming the longest in history and surpassing the 35-day record set during his first term.“I just got back from Japan,” Trump told a breakfast meeting with Republican senators at the White House. “I talked about the kamikaze pilots. I think these guys are kamikaze. They'll take down the country if they have to,"" he added, as quoted by AFP.The shutdown, which began over over a dispute on health care spending, has left federal agencies operating at a standstill since Congress failed to approve funding past September 30, leaving millions of Americans facing disruptions to essential services. Democrats say they will only vote to end the funding lapse after a deal to extend expiring insurance subsidies, while Republicans insist they will only address health care once Democrats have voted to restore funding.Some 1.4 million federal workers, including air traffic controllers and park wardens, are either on unpaid leave or working without pay. Courts are relying on emergency funds to continue operations, warning that services could slow further if the shutdown persists.The administration has warned of potential chaos at airports if the shutdown continues into November. More than 60,000 air traffic controllers and Transportation Security Administration (TSA) officers are working without pay.Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in Philadelphia, “So if you bring us to a week from today, Democrats, you will see mass chaos...you will see mass flight delays. You'll see mass cancellations, and you may see us close certain parts of the airspace, because we just cannot manage it because we don't have the air traffic controllers,"" as quoted by AFP.Some moderate Democrats are exploring potential compromises, but both parties’ leadership show little willingness to budge.Trump told CBS News he would “not be extorted.”The shutdown also threatens vital welfare programs. The administration has warned it may cut off a key food aid program, which helps 42 million Americans buy groceries, although two courts have blocked this move. The White House later clarified that it is “fully complying” with legal obligations and is working to get partial SNAP payments “out the door as much as we can and as quickly as we can.”Past shutdowns have shown how airport delays can escalate when workers call in sick rather than work without pay, a factor that contributed to Trump ending the 2019 shutdown. Democrats hope that rising insurance premiums for millions of Americans will pressure Republicans into compromise, but the standoff shows little sign of resolution.","US President Donald Trump called Democrats “kamikaze” as he blamed them for the US government shutdown.

"US-China trade: Tensions cool after Trump, Xi meet; where key sectors now stand",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-china-trade-tensions-cool-after-trump-xi-meet-where-key-sectors-now-stand/articleshow/125111681.cms,"Representative image

Here is where the two sides now stand on key sectors:

Tariffs and trade measures



Agriculture and Soybeans



Fentanyl controls



Rare Earth minerals



Export controls



TikTok







China and the United States have taken steps to cool their trade tensions after a meeting between presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping in South Korea last week.The move marks a cautious pause in a dispute that has disrupted global trade and technology ties since 2018.The trade conflict began when Donald Trump, during his first term, imposed tariffs on Chinese goods, accusing Beijing of intellectual property theft and “unfair” practices. Former President Joe Biden later kept those tariffs in place and expanded them to cover sectors such as semiconductors and electric vehicles.Following last week’s meeting, Trump agreed to cut US tariffs on all Chinese goods by 10 per cent starting November 10 and to approve one-year exemptions for certain products. In response, China will extend its suspension of an extra 24 per cent tariff on US imports for one year and remove tariffs of up to 15 per cent on various American farm products, reported AFP.However, Beijing will maintain a 10 per cent tariff on all US goods, and average US tariffs on Chinese imports will still sit at about 45 per cent.China’s retaliatory tariffs had hit US agriculture hard, especially soybean farmers who were a key source of Trump’s political support.The White House said China agreed to purchase at least 12 million metric tons of US soybeans in the final two months of 2025.Beijing confirmed it will suspend retaliatory tariffs on several American farm goods, including soybeans. It remains uncertain whether US farmers will recover the market share they lost during the conflict.China is the main source of precursor chemicals used to make fentanyl, a drug linked to a deadly epidemic in the United States. The 10 per cent tariff reduction is an easing of a 20 per cent fentanyl-related penalty previously imposed by Trump. He said Xi assured him China will “work very hard to stop the flow.”The two sides also reached a tentative understanding on rare earths, which are essential for defence, automotive and electronics manufacturing. China dominates the global mining and processing of these minerals.Recent Chinese export restrictions disrupted supply chains and prompted Trump to threaten blanket tariffs of 100 per cent on Chinese goods.After the meeting, the White House said China will issue export licences for rare earths and minerals such as gallium, germanium, antimony and graphite. Efforts by the United States, Japan and Australia to build alternative supplies are expected to take years.Washington will pause for one year a planned expansion of its “Entity List” export restrictions on Chinese firms. However, the United States continues to tighten other curbs on advanced chips and digital technologies.Wendy Cutler of the Asia Society Policy Institute said the meeting results “do little to resolve underlying structural issues that are at the heart of (the) bilateral economic tensions,"" as quoted by AFP.Both sides said they have agreed on a framework for the transfer of TikTok’s US operations from its Chinese parent company ByteDance.US treasury secretary Scott Bessent said the deal is expected to “go forward in the coming weeks.” China’s commerce ministry said it is willing to “work with the United States to properly resolve” the issue.","China and the United States have taken steps to cool their trade tensions.

What the US government is saying & its Plan B



Global trade implications



What happens next



Wednesday: The Supreme Court hearing begins at 10am ET (local time)

Afterwards: The justices may take months to issue a decision; the administration has asked for expedited resolution.

Regardless of the outcome: The tariffs currently remain in effect while the case proceeds. Lower‐court rulings striking them down have been stayed pending appeal.



(With inputs from agencies, Reuters)





The US Supreme Court is scheduled to hear arguments on Wednesday at 10am ET (local time) over the legality of sweeping tariffs imposed by Donald Trump - a case that could reshape the reach of presidential power and ripple through the global economy.The dispute centres on Trump’s invocation of the international emergency economic powers act (IEEPA) - a 1977 law meant for national emergencies - to levy tariffs on nearly every US trading partner. The administration contends the tariffs are justified as measures to protect national security and the economy. Lower courts, however, ruled he exceeded his authority. If the Court strikes down the tariffs, the effect could extend far beyond US trade: the government collected an estimated $89 billion between February 4 and September 23 under these duties.Lower courts found fault with the administration’s use of IEEPA: the US court of appeals for the federal circuit in Washington ruled in a 7-4 decision that Congress did not intend for IEEPA to grant the president unlimited tariff authority - noting that “none of these actions explicitly include the power to impose tariffs, duties, or the like, or the power to tax.” The administration argues that IEEPA authorises the president to “regulate commerce” in a national emergency - a reading which it says encompasses control of imports.But critics argue that imposing taxes or tariffs is a core power of Congress, not the executive. Given the potentially enormous economic impact (estimates of trillions of dollars over a decade), the court’s decision is widely seen as a precedent-setting test of separation of powers, executive authority, and US trade policy.Top administration officials are treating the case as high-stakes. Treasury secretary Scott Bessent is attending the arguments in person, underscoring the importance.In public remarks, Bessent warned of “massive refund” obligations - in the range of $750 billion to $1 trillion - if the tariffs were struck down.Significantly, the administration has already signalled a fallback strategy: if the Court invalidates the IEEPA-based tariffs, the government can turn to other legal authorities to impose duties. As Bessent put it: “there are lots of other authorities that we can operate under.”Analysts say possible alternate legal routes include statutes such as the Tariff Act of 1930 (section 338) or provisions of the Trade Act of 1974, though these come with stricter limits and shorter durations.The tariffs being challenged were not minor - they targeted broad swaths of US imports from major trading partners. Some were justified by the administration as responses to the fentanyl crisis, chronic trade deficits, and other “unusual and extraordinary threats.” A ruling against the tariffs could introduce major uncertainty in global trade lines, prompting trading partners to question US commitments, negotiate harder, or rethink the stability of deals. Conversely, if the Court upholds the tariffs, it could embolden more aggressive US trade policy and shift global power dynamics in commerce.","The US Supreme Court is scheduled to hear arguments on Wednesday at 10am ET (local time) over the legality of sweeping tariffs imposed by Donald Trump.

‘Trump’s Team In Serious Discussions With India’: White House As India-US Trade Talks Continue





China on Wednesday announced it will extend the suspension of an additional 24 per cent tariff on American goods for another year, while retaining a 10 per cent general tariff.According to a statement on the Ministry of Finance website, as cited by AFP, the State Council approved the measure, saying that “for one year, the 24 per cent tariff on US goods will continue to be suspended, and a 10 per cent tariff on US goods will remain. ”The extension, effective from November 10, follows recent China–US trade talks and marks a continued pause in escalating tariff measures.Following discussions in South Korea, Chinese President Xi Jinping and US President Donald Trump reached an agreement to maintain the existing arrangement for another year. On Tuesday, Trump confirmed that Washington would lower its supplementary tariffs on Chinese imports from 20 per cent to 10 per cent, starting November 10.Trade tensions between the world’s two largest economies have flared this year, with both sides imposing steep duties on each other’s goods, at times reaching triple-digit levels. While senior economic officials have held frequent discussions to stabilise ties, frictions persist over export controls and technology access.In another move involving tariffs, China said it would lift tariffs of up to 15 per cent on certain American agricultural imports, including soybeans — a gesture seen as part of broader efforts to ease trade pressure.","China will extend the suspension of an additional 24 per cent tariff on American goods for another year.

TVS Motor Company (TVS) on Tuesday unveiled the first four new Norton motorbike models, designed under its leadership since rescuing the iconic British brand from administration five years ago.The all-new Manx and Manx R supersport models, along with the Atlas and Atlas GT, were launched at EICMA, the annual international motorcycle exhibition in Milan, Italy.TOI had an exclusive preview of the highly anticipated models at Norton’s new Solihull headquarters ahead of the official launch.India’s third-largest two-wheeler manufacturer has invested over £200 million in the Solihull manufacturing facility and company headquarters, opened in 2021. When TVS acquired the beleaguered Norton in April 2020 from entrepreneur Stuart Garner, the company had just 55 staff. Today, it employs over 200, many of whom are Norton enthusiasts.Chief concept engineer Mark Burditt, who worked at Norton prior to TVS’s takeover, said, “We were very short-staffed before TVS took over. The business just ran on passion, there was no money. Now it is much more professional, there is more money and we can do it in the right way.The difference between then and now is light and day.”In September, Norton confirmed the end of production for its V4SV, V4CR, and Commando 961 models to make way for innovative new bikes under TVS leadership. The new models have been three years in development.Since early 2025, TVS has increased Norton staff by 25% and plans to ramp up production from three bikes per day to 24 per day. The company aims to expand its dealer network to over 200 showrooms across Asia, Europe, and the USA from the 2026 season.For the first time, Norton motorcycles—favoured by Clint Eastwood and Keanu Reeves—will be sold in India. The Atlas is expected to be the most popular model locally, while the Manx and Manx R are set to appeal to European and American buyers.The Atlas and Atlas GT are class-leading middleweight adventure bikes, designed to combine rugged performance with versatility for both off-road and on-road use. By the end of the decade, two Nomad urban scramblers will complete the range. Most bikes will be made to order and handcrafted at the Solihull factory using premium British parts, with engines manufactured in India.The Solihull facility serves as a global hub for research, development, and design, with capacity to build 8,000 motorcycles annually. It leverages TVS’s manufacturing systems and supply chain while maintaining independent design and brand control in the UK.“Norton is a proudly British brand with a UK base for our design, development and engineering, and through TVS Motor, it now has a platform for a global manufacturing and distribution network,” said Richard Arnold, executive director, Norton Motorcycles.Speaking at the preview, TVS managing director Sudarshan Venu credited his guru, the late Professor Lord Kumar Bhattacharyya, and chief mentor Sir Ralf Speth for inspiring TVS to scale globally. “In fact I still remember going to his office five years ago and asking if we should buy Norton and now we are here for the resurgence,” Venu said.“TVS is a business with a legacy of over 100 years and built on certain core values of maintaining trust, focused on quality and customers and investment in products, technology and innovation. It is on this basis that our chairman emeritus started TVS Motors in 1980 with courage and conviction to become one of the leading two-wheeler players in the world today. We sell over six million vehicles, 35% of that outside our home market in India, we have relevant market share in over 50 countries and people from over 55 nationalities are part of TVS Motors today,"" said Sudarshan Venu.Gerry McGovern, the former JLR design chief, was appointed Norton’s chief creative advisor. He said the strategy was to make Norton a “really modern highly desirable brand. We are not interested in creating commodities, we are interested in creating objects of desire.”The design approach focuses on being “super modern, clean, reductive, looking forward, integrated, dramatic and connected.” He added, “A bike should have a level of drama. How does it feel to ride and handle? Does it make you smile?”The new bikes are visually cohesive yet distinct, combining modernity, luxury, and artisanal engineering. The Manx R exemplifies a less-is-more philosophy, featuring a 1,200 cc V4 engine—the largest in the supersport category—with a dry weight of 204 kg. It achieves a 1 hp per kg power-to-weight ratio and includes an 8-inch touchscreen, Brembo Hypure brakes, under-slung exhaust, single-sided swingarm, carbon fibre body panels, wheels, and five ride modes.Founded in 1898 by James Lansdowne Norton as a bicycle parts supplier, Norton produced its first motorcycle by 1902. The brand is historically renowned for design, craftsmanship, and performance. Norton motorcycles appeared in The Motorcycle Diaries and the James Bond film Spectre, served in the British Army during World War II, and remain synonymous with the Isle of Man TT race.","TVS Motor Company (TVS) unveiled the first four new Norton motorbike models.

'Unfair, Unjustified': Piyush Goyal Exposes US Tariff Logic, Says India Won’t Accept One-Sided Rules





On the eve of a closely watched Supreme Court hearing, US President Donald Trump warned that the case could determine the country’s very survival — labeling it as a ""life or death"" situation for America’s economic and national security.In a post on Truth Social, Trump said the hearing would decide whether the United States remains strong or becomes “virtually defenseless” in the face of global competition. Tomorrow’s United States Supreme Court case is, literally, LIFE OR DEATH for our Country. With a Victory, we have tremendous, but fair, Financial and National Security. Without it, we are virtually defenseless against other Countries who have, for years, taken advantage of us,"" he said.He argued that his ability to impose tariffs — a cornerstone of his trade policy — has been essential in protecting American industries and securing leverage in international negotiations. “Our stock market is hitting record highs, and our country has never been more respected than it is right now,” Trump wrote. “A big part of this is the economic security created by tariffs, and the deals that we have negotiated because of them.Meanwhile, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the administration was fully prepared for any outcome but expressed confidence in its legal footing ahead of the Supreme Court hearing. “The White House is always preparing for a plan B. It would be imprudent for the President’s advisors not to do so,” Leavitt said, adding that the administration stood “100 per cent behind the President and his team’s legal arguments and the merits of the law in this case. ” She said the White House remained optimistic that “the Supreme Court is going to do the right thing.”Leavitt emphasised that the implications of the case go beyond Trump’s presidency. “This isn’t just about President Trump — it’s about how future presidents can use emergency tariff powers,” she noted, reiterating that Trump considers economic security and national security to be “inseparable.”Trump’s global tariff policy will come under judicial scrutiny on Wednesday as the Supreme Court takes up a pivotal case testing the extent of his trade authority.The outcome could have far-reaching implications, though Trump’s sweeping tariffs on several countries are expected to remain in force regardless of how the Court rules.Trump, who has imposed multiple rounds of tariffs and secondary duties on a range of nations, will not attend the high-profile hearing. While he had earlier indicated an interest in being present, the President later said he decided against it to avoid turning the proceedings into a “distraction.”The US top court will weigh whether President Donald Trump overstepped his authority by invoking the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose sweeping import tariffs.Lower courts previously found that Trump lacked the legal basis under IEEPA to levy such duties but allowed the measures to remain in effect pending the Supreme Court’s final ruling.","The US top court will weigh whether President Donald Trump overstepped his authority by invoking the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) The outcome could have far-reaching implications, though Trump’s sweeping tariffs on several countries are expected to remain in force regardless of how the Court rules.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125100322,imgsize-1414482,width-400,resizemode-4/article-56.jpg"

A sharp slowdown in its biggest market has pushed Yum Brands to review its ownership of Pizza Hut, signalling the fast-food giant may be open to selling the struggling pizza chain, AP reported.Chief Executive Officer Chris Turner said the company has begun a formal review of strategic options for Pizza Hut, which remains profitable in several global markets but continues to lose ground in the United States.Pizza Hut operates close to 20,000 restaurants across more than 100 countries, with international sales up 2% in the first nine months of the year. China is its second-largest market after the US. However, in the same period, US sales declined 7%, reflecting the chain’s prolonged struggle to adapt to consumer demand for quick pickup and delivery.“The Pizza Hut team has been working hard to address business and category challenges; however, Pizza Hut’s performance indicates the need to take additional action to help the brand realise its full value, which may be better executed outside of Yum Brands,” Turner said in a statement.He added that the decision aims “to truly take advantage of the brand we’ve built and the opportunities ahead,” as Yum initiates a “thorough review of strategic options.”The company did not set a timeline for completing the review and said no further comments would be made.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Space sector start-up Sisir Radar to develop SAR on L/P band SAR,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/space-sector-start-up-sisir-radar-to-develop-sar-on-l/p-band-sar/articleshow/104558111.cms,"CHENNAI: Space sector startup, Sisir Radar Private Ltd has hit success at the prestigious iDEX DefSpace Challenge with its projects for development of “L/P band Continuous Wave SAR (synthetic aperture radar) payload for LEO Small Satellites” and “Unfurlable, Electronically Steering Antenna for L/P band SAR payload” for Indian Air Force (IAF), said a top company official.The company is promoted by former Director at the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) Tapan Misra and the brains behind the Indian space agency’s RISAT series of SAR satellites as well as the Dual Frequency SAR on the Chandrayaan 2 orbiter that is currently circling the moon.""A grant of Rs 3 crore is also there for development of the products,"" Misra told IANS.Synthetic Aperture Radar or SAR is a special kind of imaging radar technology that can provide extremely accurate high resolution imagery of the terrain through clouds, smoke and dust even in pitch dark conditions. SAR imagery provides much higher resolution than other forms of remote sensing technology such as hyperspectral and multispectral. SAR is a critical technology for strategic reconnaissance and planning as well as for disaster management.According to Misra, winning the challenge in just over a year of floating the company is a major booster.He said L and P band SAR have an advantage over other frequencies (like X band) when it comes to penetration capabilities through rain, clouds, foliage and vegetation in a tropical country like India, and underground penetration capabilities in dry terrain.Continuing further, he said the L band SAR will provide 1 metre resolution, spotlight resolution in Stripmap mode. The current industry standard is 5-10 metre in L band. Misra said both the L and P band will operate simultaneously from a satellite borne SAR. Recently, Sisir Radar successfully developed and tested the world’s highest resolution L-Band SAR fitted on a drone. With 0.2 metre resolution, this is by far the highest L band SAR in the world, he said.","Space sector startup, Sisir Radar Private Ltd has hit success at the prestigious iDEX DefSpace Challenge.

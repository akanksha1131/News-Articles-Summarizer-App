Stock market today: Indian equity benchmark indices, Nifty50 and BSE Sensex , opened in green on Thursday but closed in red after a sharp decline in the last two trading sessions. While Nifty50 was at 24,430, BSE Sensex was down over 270 points. At closing, i.e. 3.30 pm, Nifty50 settled at 24,426.85, down 74.05 points or 0.30%. BSE Sensex was at 79,809.65, down 270.92 points or 0.34%.Market experts indicate that supportive measures including GST reforms, import duty adjustments and the 'Swadeshi' initiative are anticipated to provide stability to domestic markets despite international trade challenges.Dr. VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Investments Limited says, “A significant takeaway from the market trend yesterday is that despite the big buying of Rs 6920 crores by DIIs, overwhelming the FII selling of Rs 3856 crores, Nifty drifted down by 211 points. The reason for this important market trend is the increasing short build up by the FIIs. The negative sentiments in the market triggered by the 50% Trump tariff and the high valuations in India has encouraged the FIIs to increase their short positions. September series historically has been known for big moves. A quick decision on the tariff policy can lead to reversal of sentiments and short covering. We don’t know whether this will happen.“The policy initiatives in India - the fiscal stimulus through the Budget, monetary stimulus through rate cuts and the coming GST rationalisation- should revive economic growth and corporate earnings in India in the coming quarters. That is when we will have a fundamentally supported rally in the market. Investors can utilise the dips in the market to buy fairly-valued stocks and wait patiently in anticipation of the rally. ""Thursday saw record-breaking closes for the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average after Nvidia's quarterly results, whilst below elevated expectations, confirmed robust AI infrastructure spending.Asian stocks opened cautiously following US markets' new peak, supported by data highlighting economic robustness ahead of Friday's Federal Reserve preferred price indicator.Gold prices remained steady on Friday, trading close to their peak levels seen in over a month, supported by a weaker dollar and heightened anticipation of a US Federal Reserve interest rate reduction in September, boosting the precious metal's appeal.","Indian equity benchmark indices, Nifty50 and BSE Sensex, opened in green on Thursday but closed in red after a sharp decline in the last two trading sessions.

Stock market recommendations:Benchmark Indices witnessed sharp decline during last week, with Nifty closing the August month expiry around 24,500 levels. Investors are closely tracking the government’s fiscal and policy interventions, with emphasis on potential GST rationalization and sectoral stimulus packages aimed at alleviating tariff-induced headwinds and reinforcing the broader growth trajectory. US has enforced a steep 50% tariff on Indian imports from August 27, 2025, India stands at a pivotal juncture, testing both its economic resilience and diplomatic agility.Going ahead to pause the current down move index needs to close above previous sessions high, failing to do so will keep the bias down.Nifty has an immediate support base placed at 24,400-24,350 levels being the confluence of the recent lows and the key retracement area. Index holding above the same will lead to a consolidation in the range of 24,400-24,900. While failure to do so will signal acceleration of decline towards 24,000-23,800 levels being the confluence of the 52 weeks EMA and the previous major lows and the previous major breakout area.On the higher side resistance is seen around 24,900 levels. Only a move above the same will signal a pause in the downtrend. While a move above 24,900 will extend pullback towards the major resistance area of 25150-25,250 levels being the confluence of the 61.8% retracement of the entire decline and the previous swing high.We expect volatility to pick up tracking tariff development and GDP numbers. Hence, focus should be on accumulating quality stocks backed by strong earnings, especially those poised to benefit from next-generation GST reforms and upcoming festive season.Bank Nifty formed a sizable bear candle with a lower high and lower low signaling continuation of the corrective decline as the index closed below the 100 days EMA. Index in the process closed below the last 3 weeks range (54,900-56,100) highlighting extension of the decline.Going ahead, failure to move above 55,000 will keep the bias down and will open downside towards 53,500- 53,000 levels in the coming sessions.Key support is placed at 53,000 levels being the confluence of the 200 days EMA and the low of May 2025.The stock has recently generated a breakout above the consolidation range (210-165) with strong volume signaling resumption of up move and higher participation at the breakout area thus offering fresh entry opportunity.We expect the stock to extend up move and head towards 257 levels in the coming months being the measuring implication of the range breakout.The weekly stochastic remains in a strong up trend forming higher high and higher low thus supports the positive bias in the stock.The stock has recently generated a breakout above the bullish rounding formation signaling continuation of the up trend and offers fresh entry opportunity.The stock has outperformed the overall market and is likely to extend its current outperformance.We expect the stock to head towards 270 levels in the coming months being the measuring implication of the rounding formation. Weekly MACD remains in a strong up trend thus supports the positive bias.","According to Bajaj Broking Research, Godawari Power and Ispat Limited and Apollo Micro Systems are the top stock picks for today.

Mumbai: The share of mutual funds in the household sector's gross financial savings increased from 0.9% in 2011-12 to 6% in 2022-23. Assets under management have grown at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 17.1%. This has made mutual funds a stabilising force in equities and helped cushion the equity market against volatility triggered by FPI outflows according to a report by RBI. The central bank has called for enhanced investor education and protection to maintain the faith and trust of new entrants.For decades, Indian households preferred the safety of fixed deposits and gold. That is changing. A recent report, Equity Mutual Funds: Transforming India's Savings Landscape, documents how equity mutual funds have ""emerged as the preferred vehicle for household investors to invest in equity markets."" The shift, it says, is driven by rising incomes, growing financial literacy and the spread of digital technology.Their clout as shareholders has also increased sharply, with ""the shareholding of MFs in companies listed on the National Stock Exchange (NSE) rising from 3.7% at end-March 2010 to 10.4% at end-March 2025.""The report identifies three main factors shaping flows into equity funds: ""increasing financial inclusion (proxied by demat accounts), fixed deposit rates, and business confidence.""The expansion of demat accounts, it notes, ""should lead to additional flows to equity-oriented products."" Persistently low deposit rates have had the opposite effect-pushing savers to seek higher returns elsewhere.""A persistently low fixed deposit rate for an extended period might eventually lead people to search for other asset classes that offer higher returns, thereby increasing equity MF flows."" The business confidence index, meanwhile, ""is expected to impact flows, as it is an indicator of future growth.""","The share of mutual funds in the household sector's gross financial savings increased from 0.9% in 2011-12 to 6% in 2022-23.

New Delhi: Govt has retained the 6.3-6.8% growth projection for the current financial year, despite expectations of Trump's tariffs denting economic activity and overall global demand.While steps such as the proposed reduction in GST will aid domestic consumption, chief economic adviser V Anantha Nageswaran told reporters Friday that the tension is likely to ease, and the impact may be concentrated during the July-Sept quarter. He is also counting on low inflation and the festival season to result in good demand in the coming months.Good rains and higher sowing are expected to keep rural demand strong. High frequency indicators such as fuel consumption and e-way bill generation point to the first quarter consumption boom continuing during the current quarter too.""There is some uncertainty... but in general, conversation is going on, and there is expectation that we will see some kind of a resolution in not-so-distant future.

Date determination based on lunar observations





Significance of the 12th of Rabi Al Awwal





Who was Prophet Muhammad (PBUH)?





Public holiday outlook in the UAE









This year, the Islamic calendar places the birth anniversary of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) on Friday, September 5, 2025. Based on lunar observations and official announcements, the date could coincide with a long weekend in the UAE, marking a time of spiritual reflection and public observance. Here's a detailed look at how the holiday is determined and why it matters.The Islamic calendar follows the lunar cycle, and significant dates—such as religious holidays—are determined by the sighting of the new moon. On Saturday, August 23, 2025, the International Astronomy Center in the UAE confirmed that the crescent moon marking the beginning of Rabi Al Awwal, the third month of the Islamic calendar, was not sighted anywhere across the Arab world.This absence of moon sighting means the start of the month differs by region. Some countries began Rabi Al Awwal on Sunday, while others started it on Monday. In Oman, for instance, the new lunar month started later, which pushed the 12th day of Rabi Al Awwal—the date of Prophet Muhammad's birth anniversary—to Friday, September 5, 2025.Although the UAE government has not yet issued an official holiday announcement, the alignment of this date with the weekend (Saturday and Sunday) has led to speculation that UAE residents may receive a three-day public holiday—Friday through Sunday.The 12th day of Rabi Al Awwal holds profound importance in the Islamic world as it commemorates the birth of Prophet Muhammad (Peace Be Upon Him). This day is not only a religious observance but also a moment for Muslims to reflect on the Prophet's life, teachings, and legacy.In many Islamic countries, the day is marked by prayers, religious lectures, and community gatherings. While cultural and traditional expressions of this day vary, the central focus remains on honouring the Prophet’s character, compassion, and leadership.Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) is regarded as the founder of Islam and the final messenger in the line of prophets that includes Abraham, Moses, and Jesus. He received and conveyed the Qurʾān, the holy book of Islam, and his teachings form the core of Islamic belief and practice.He was born in Mecca (in present-day Saudi Arabia) around the year 570 CE, known as the Year of the Elephant. His life is recognized not only for its religious significance but also for his role as a spiritual guide and political leader, who transformed Arabian society through principles of justice, mercy, and unity.The Prophet passed away on June 8, 632 CE, in Medina, at approximately 62 years of age. His legacy continues to influence over a billion Muslims around the world.While the UAE’s official public holiday calendar has not confirmed the Prophet’s Birthday holiday yet, the alignment of the 12th of Rabi Al Awwal with Friday, September 5, makes it likely that residents could enjoy an extended weekend. If declared, this would be a three-day break, from Friday to Sunday.Public holidays in the UAE for Islamic events are typically aligned with moon sightings, and dates can vary until officially confirmed.

US stocks today: Wall Street slips from record highs as inflation steadies; traders eye September Fed rate cut,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-stocks-today-wall-street-slips-from-record-highs-as-inflation-steadies-traders-eye-september-fed-rate-cut/articleshow/123586989.cms,"



Stocks retreated on Wall Street on Friday, pulling back from their latest all-time highs, after fresh inflation data showed prices largely holding steady. The S&P 500 fell 0.5% a day after notching a record high and remains on track to end August with a nearly 2% gain, its fourth consecutive month of advances.The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 125 points, or 0.3%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite slid 0.9% as of 9:58 a.m. Eastern time. Losses in technology shares weighed on markets, offsetting gains in health care and other sectors, AP reported.Dell Technologies tumbled 9.7%, the sharpest decline among S&P 500 stocks, despite posting second-quarter revenue above expectations. The company flagged margin pressures and weakness in PC demand. Other technology names also declined, with Nvidia falling 2.8%, Broadcom dropping 2.7% and Oracle sliding 3.6%.The Commerce Department reported that prices rose 2.6% in July from a year earlier, unchanged from June and in line with forecasts. Core prices, excluding food and energy, increased 2.9% year-on-year, slightly higher than June’s 2.8% and the fastest since February.While inflation has cooled from its 7% peak three years ago, it remains above the Federal Reserve’s 2% target.Fed Chair Jerome Powell signalled last week that a rate cut could come as early as next month, citing signs of a softening labour market.“Today’s in-line PCE Price Index will keep the focus on the jobs market,” said Ellen Zentner, chief economic strategist at Morgan Stanley Wealth Management. “For now, the odds still favor a September cut.”Traders currently assign an 87% chance of a quarter-point cut at the Fed’s next meeting, according to CME Group data. Lower rates can spur investment and borrowing but also carry the risk of stoking inflation.Bond yields edged higher, with the 10-year Treasury rising to 4.23% from 4.21%, while the 2-year yield held steady at 3.63%.

US postal policy shift: De minimis ends after 86 years- all you need to know about the scrapped rule,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-postal-policy-shift-de-minimis-ends-after-86-years-all-you-need-to-know-about-the-scrapped-rule/articleshow/123581064.cms,"Representative AI image

What was the De Minimis rule?

What changes now?

Who is affected?





The United States has moved to end its long-standing de minimis tariff exemption for small international packages, eliminating duty-free entry for imports valued at $800 or less.The change, effective Friday, August 29, follows an executive order issued last month and comes nearly two years earlier than the original Congressional timeline. It is expected to affect millions of daily e-commerce deliveries into the US.The de minimis exemption allowed low-value imports to enter the US without paying customs duties, easing cross-border e-commerce. Introduced in 1938 at just $1, the threshold was gradually raised—$5 in 1990, $200 in 1993, and $800 in 2015. In 2023, 1.36 billion packages worth $64 billion entered duty-free under this system, compared with 134 million in 2015, as reported by Economic Times.Both now-president Trump and his predecessor Biden had raised concerns about misuse of the rule, including for smuggling illicit goods such as fentanyl, and its impact on US businesses.Also read: Donald Trump scraps duty-free parcel exemption rule; cites tariff evasion, drug smuggling Starting Friday, all imports will face US customs duties based on their country of origin and product category.Tariff rates range between 10 per cent and 50 per cent- for example, around 10 per cent for shipments from the UK and Australia, and as high as 50 per cent for goods from Brazil and India.Carriers must now file proper documentation for each shipment. Where paperwork is incomplete, they can opt to pay a flat duty of $80–$200 per package for six months as postal systems adapt. Personal gifts worth under $100 and traveller items up to $200 will still enter duty-free.China and Hong Kong dominate the small-package trade, accounting for about 60 per cent of US-bound shipments in 2024. Other major suppliers include Canada, Mexico, the EU, India and Vietnam.The new tariffs are likely to raise prices for online shoppers and reshape global e-commerce flows. Companies such as Shein and Temu, which already have large US distribution networks, may benefit as consumers seek cheaper alternatives despite added duties.","The United States has moved to end its long-standing de minimis tariff exemption for small international packages.

According to government data cited by AP, hiring has slowed significantly since spring. Job gains averaged at 35,000 a month in the three months to July, less than a quarter of last year’s pace.Unemployment benefit claims are a key proxy for layoffs and have mostly stayed in the range of 200,000 to 250,000 since the country emerged from the COVID-19 pandemic more than three years ago.Despite the low level of layoffs, hiring has weakened, a trend many economists now call a “no hire, no fire” economy. The unemployment rate remains at a relatively low 4.2%.Economic growth has also cooled this year, with businesses holding back on expansion plans amid uncertainty over President Donald Trump’s tariff policies. The economy grew at just a 1.3% annual rate in the first half of 2025, down from 2.5% in 2024, AP reported.The slowdown has increased expectations that the Fed could cut interest rates at its next meeting on 16–17 September. Fed Chair Jerome Powell signalled last week that a reduction in the key rate may be on the cards, which could in turn lower costs for mortgages, car loans and business borrowing.The latest report also showed that the four-week average of claims, which smooths out fluctuations, rose by 2,500 to 228,500.The number of people continuing to receive unemployment benefits for the week ending August 16 slipped by 7,000 to 1.95 million. Though slightly lower, that figure is still close to a four-year high, pointing to the difficulties many jobseekers face in securing new work once unemployed.","Applications for jobless aid dropped by 5,000 to 229,000 for the week ending 23 August.

Donald Trump vs Fed gov: Lisa Cook sues Trump admin; asks to 'confirm her status' as board member,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/donald-trump-vs-fed-gov-lisa-cook-sues-trump-admin-asks-to-confirm-her-status-as-board-member/articleshow/123567129.cms,"Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook has taken the Trump administration to court after the US president tried to fire her.Cook’s lawsuit, filed by lawyer Abbe David Lowell, seeks an injunction to block her dismissal and “confirm her status” as a member of the central bank’s governing board.The case is being seen as an extraordinary legal fight that could redefine Fed’s independence. In the institution’s 112 years, no US president has ever attempted to fire a Fed governor, until Donald Trump published a letter on social media announcing that Cook had been removed.He stated that she was being fired because of allegations of mortgage fraud dating back to 2021, before she joined the board, AP reported.Most observing the matter expect the battle to end up before the Supreme Court . The Court has previously said the president cannot dismiss Fed officials over disagreements on policy, but can do so “for cause,” a term that usually covers misconduct or neglect of duty. Cook, however, has not been charged with any crime.Her lawsuit argues that the claims have nothing to do with her work at the Fed and remain unproven. It also argues she was not given a chance to respond before being targeted.""The unsubstantiated and unproven allegation that Governor Cook ‘potentially’ erred in filling out a mortgage form prior to her Senate confirmation—does not amount to 'cause,'"" the filing says, as cited by AP.“Allowing the President to remove members of the Board over policy disagreements would also render illusory the Board’s independence,” it continues.The move comes as Trump has stepped up attacks on Fed chair Jerome Powell and the central bank’s interest-rate committee for not lowering borrowing costs more quickly. However, Powell has already signalled another rate cut could be coming at the 16–17 September meeting.Cook’s suit suggests the allegations are just an excuse to get rid of her, “the mortgage allegations against her are pretextual, in order to effectuate her prompt removal and vacate a seat for President Trump to fill and forward his agenda to undermine the independence of the Federal Reserve.”As the Trump has previously said that he will only nominate people who back lower rates, the dismissal attempt paves the way for the White House to appoint a Trump loyalist, AP reported.The Fed is one of the most powerful institutions in the US economy, influencing the cost of mortgages, car loans and business borrowing by setting short-term interest rates.If the courts allow Trump’s firing of Cook to stand, analysts warn it could strip the Fed of its ability to act independently. That would make it harder for the bank to take unpopular steps, such as raising rates to control inflation.","Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook has taken the Trump administration to court after the US president tried to fire her.

Wall Street traded mix on Thursday as investors weighed stronger-than-expected US economic growth against record earnings from Nvidia, the American chipmaker at the centre of the artificial intelligence boom.The S&P 500 and Nasdaq both opened higher, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average traded in red.Nasdaq jumped 45 points or 0.21% to 21,635 and S&P 500 inched up 1 point or 0.02% to 6,482.Dow, on the other hand, slipped to 45,483, down 81 points or 0.18% at 7.20 PM IST.Shares in Nvidia slipped about 1%, despite the California-based company posting a profit of $26.4 billion on record second-quarter revenue of $46.7 billion.Investors had been eagerly awaiting the results late on Wednesday, as Nvidia’s rapid growth has helped fuel gains across tech stocks in recent months. However, its shares weakened after a fall in key data centre revenue, raising questions about whether the AI surge can continue at the same pace.""The market seems to be asking whether Nvidia can keep up this pace as competition intensifies and AI enthusiasm starts to look a little overbought,"" said Joshua Mahony, chief market analyst at traders Scope Markets.Alongside earnings, markets reacted to US data showing the world’s largest economy expanded by 3.3 percent in the second quarter, up from the 3.0% first estimated in July.""After the initial release, there were concerns that the domestic economy was slowing quite sharply,"" said Richard Flax, chief investment officer at Moneyfarm.According to the US commerce department, the upward revision was mainly due to stronger investment and consumer spending. Growth was also supported by a fall in US imports, after businesses had rushed to stockpile ahead of tariff increases announced by US President Donald Trump.The figures could influence the outlook for interest rates, with the Federal Reserve expected to continue cutting borrowing costs to support growth.""Overall, this release probably doesn't change Federal Reserve thinking too much,"" Flax said, noting that a 25-basis-point rate cut is still likely at the Fed’s September meeting.""But a stronger than expected result from domestic demand suggests that there might not be that much scope to cut rates over the next 12 months.""","The S&P 500 and Nasdaq both opened higher, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average traded in red.

US economy: Q2 GDP growth revised upward to 3.3%; driven by low imports and strong consumer spending,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-economy-q2-gdp-growth-revised-upward-to-3-3-driven-by-low-imports-and-strong-consumer-spending/articleshow/123565629.cms,"The United States economy showed stronger growth than previously estimated in the second quarter of the year, government figures showed on Thursday.According to the second estimates released by the US commerce department, the gross domestic product (GDP) rose at an annual rate of 3.3% between April and June, an upward revision from the 3.0% figure released in July.The rebound followed a difficult start to 2025, when the economy shrank by 0.5% in the first quarter, the first contraction in three years, largely due to the impact of Trump’s trade wars.The first-quarter downturn was driven by a surge in imports, as companies rushed to stockpile foreign goods ahead of new tariffs. Since imports are deducted from GDP, this sudden rise dragged the figures down.However, the trend flipped in the second quarter, with imports plunging at a 29.8% pace, a shift that added more than five percentage points to April–June growth.The US bureau of economic analysis said that the increase in the country’s GDP was mainly driven by a sharp drop in imports, along with higher consumer spending.The department also reported that consumer spending, which makes up about 70% of GDP, rose at a 1.6% annual rate. While still modest, this was better than both the 0.5% growth seen in the first quarter and the 1.4% initially estimated for the second quarter.However, this growth was partly held back by weaker investment and lower exports.Corporate profits from current production, which include inventory valuation and capital consumption adjustments, grew by $65.5 billion in the April–June period, compared with a fall of $90.6 billion in the previous quarter.Private investment, however, declined steeply, dropping at a 13.8% annual pace, the biggest fall since the second quarter of 2020, when the coronavirus pandemic was at its peak. A reduction in private inventories alone shaved nearly 3.3 percentage points off second-quarter GDP growth, AP reported.The real gross domestic income increased 4.8% in the second quarter against the 0.2% achieved in the first quarter. The average of real GDP and real GDI rose by 4.0% in the second quarter, a sharp turnaround from the 0.1% decline recorded in the first quarter.Government spending also weighed on the economy. Federal expenditure fell at a 4.7% annual rate, following a 4.6% decline in the first quarter.Since his return to the White House, Trump has overturned decades of US trade policy that traditionally favoured free trade. He has imposed double-digit tariffs on imports from nearly every country and targeted key products such as steel, aluminium and cars. Trump argues that tariffs protect American industry, encourage factories to return to the United States, and help finance the sweeping tax cuts he signed into law on July 4.Mainstream economists, however, warn that tariffs could harm the economy by raising costs and making protected US firms less competitive. They point out that tariffs are paid by importers in the United States, who often pass on the extra costs to customers through higher prices. While the inflationary impact so far has been limited, they caution it could grow over time, AP reported.The unpredictable way Trump has introduced tariffs, sometimes announcing them, suspending them, and then launching new ones, has left businesses unsettled and uncertain about making investments or hiring.The third estimate for the GDP growth of the second quarter will release on September 25.","GDP rose at an annual rate of 3.3% between April and June, an upward revision from the 3.0% figure released in July. rebound followed a difficult start to 2025, when the economy shrank by 0.5% in the first quarter, the first contraction in three years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123565784,imgsize-200744,width-400,resizemode-4/us-economy-grows-33-in-second-quarter.jpg"
Ontorio liquor ban stays: Doug Ford warns no American booze without fair trade deal; domestic sales surge,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/ontorio-liquor-ban-stays-doug-ford-warns-no-american-booze-without-fair-trade-deal-domestic-sales-surge/articleshow/123562269.cms,"Representative Image (AI-generated)

Ontario Premier Doug Ford on Wednesday said that the province’s ban on American alcohol will stay in place until US President Donald Trump removes tariffs on Canadian goods or a new free trade deal is reached. He cautioned that such an agreement could take a long time.Ford introduced the ban in March, ordering the Liquor Control Board of Ontario (LCBO) to remove US alcohol from its shelves in response to Trump’s tariffs on Canadian products. He indicated the ban could become a bargaining chip in upcoming negotiations on a new North American free trade pact, as reported by CBC.""If there's a deal, another USMCA deal, which I don't think is going to happen for the next few months — but you never know with President Trump, he could pull the carpet out from underneath us in a heartbeat like he has before — or they get rid of their tariffs and then we'll bring the booze back into the LCBO, and if they don't, then they aren't getting any booze on our shelves,"" Ford said.Last week, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney announced that the country would lift certain retaliatory tariffs on American goods covered under the Canada-US-Mexico Agreement (CUSMA), signaling a different approach from Ford.In March, Canada had imposed 25 per cent tariffs on a wide range of American products, including oranges, alcohol, motorcycles, and cosmetics. Carney explained that those measures reflected the state of negotiations at the time, but a different approach is now required.However, Canada is keeping its counter-tariffs on steel, aluminum and automobiles at 25 per cent.Trump has steadily increased tariffs on Canadian goods, raising them to 35 per cent in August, citing cross-border fentanyl flows and Canada’s counter-tariffs as reasons. Some duties remain exempt under CUSMA.Ford continues to push for a firm response, saying Canada must protect its steelworkers by matching US tariffs dollar-for-dollar.""I just believe when they're tariffing us 50 per cent on our steel and the whole world's using Canada as a dumping ground for steel, we have to make changes,"" Ford said.""We're tariffing them 25 per cent, fair is fair. I'd tariff them 50 per cent on our aluminum, copper, forestry products and obviously steel. We have to protect our steelworkers here in Ontario. So we have to fight fire with fire, but we'll see how the prime minister makes out.""Meanwhile, Ontario’s ban has boosted domestic alcohol sales. Since the policy took effect, Ontario wine sales have risen 67 per cent, while overall sales of Ontario and Canadian-made alcohol at the LCBO grew 19 per cent in three months.In Quebec, the liquor board was considering discarding expired US alcohol but was directed instead to donate it to charity. Ford said Ontario has no plans to destroy American alcohol yet.""We still have a few months before anything expires and we'll take it from there,"" he said.His office clarified that less than one per cent of US alcohol has expired and another one per cent will not expire for another decade.Liberal parliamentary leader John Fraser argued that the alcohol ban should be leveraged by the federal government during trade negotiations. However, he noted that Ford is not involved in the talks and said the premier’s tough words about Trump are just for show.“It’s all show and no substance,” Fraser said.","Ontario Premier Doug Ford said that the province’s ban on American alcohol will stay in place until US President Donald Trump removes tariffs on Canadian goods or a new free trade deal is reached.

Political tensions have added to caution after Trump escalated his fight with the Fed by seeking to fire Governor Lisa Cook, whose lawyer said she would sue to contest the move. Trump has repeatedly clashed with the central bank over its cautious stance on rates, warning that his tariff policies could re-ignite inflation. He has also threatened to dismiss Fed Chair Jerome Powell.Despite political pressure, traders are betting the Fed will lower its benchmark interest rate at its September meeting. According to CME Group data, markets are pricing in a 90.3% probability of a quarter-point cut.The Fed cut rates in late 2024 after a long tightening cycle aimed at taming inflation, which was largely successful thanks to resilient consumer spending and a strong labour market. Rates have been held steady this year amid concerns that higher tariffs under Trump could stoke fresh price pressures. Lower rates make borrowing easier and can spur investment, though they also risk fuelling inflation.Investors now await Friday’s release of the US personal consumption expenditures index, the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.","Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain.

Incremental capital output ratio

NEW DELHI: India's gross domestic product (GDP) data for the third quarter (October-December 2022) received a word of caution from the former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan In an interview with news agency PTI, Rajan that India is ""dangerously close"" to the Hindu rate of growth in view of subdued private sector investment, high interest rates and slowing global growth.India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying"".However, a report released by the State Bank of India (SBI) economists on Tuesday dismissed arguments that India is dangerously close to Hindu rate of growth saying such statements are ""ill-conceived, biased and premature"".The term 'Hindu growth rate' was coined by late economist Raj Krishna in 1978 to describe the slow growth in the country.It basically refers to the low pace of economic growth rates during 1950s to 1980s. During this period, the Indian economy averaged 3.5%.A former lecturer at the Delhi School of Economics (DSE), Krishna noted that only if the rate of growth is persistently slow and accompanied by low per-capita GDP, then it will be known as Hindu rate of growth but it has to factor in population growth as well.Before economic reforms of 1991, India's economic growth remained stagnant and low, while per capita income averaged around 1.3%. Krishna termed this low growth situation to be a result of socialist policies of state control and import substitution.However, the economic situation changed when liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation (LPG) reforms came into effect in the year 1991, at a time when India faced balance of payment crisis.Over the years, many economists have strongly opposed the idea of 'Hindu growth rate' and the term never had universal acceptance.The Indian economy plunged into its very first technical recession in FY21 due to the impact of Covid-19 pandemic and the related nationwide lockdowns. GDP shrunk by an unprecedented 23.8% in the first quarter of the financial year 2020-21. However, due to spurt in economic activities in the subsequent quarters, the GDP decline started to narrow.However, if we look at the period before Covid-19 as well, India's growth curve shows a declining trend.From 8.26% in FY17, GDP growth plunged to 3.74% in FY20. Shutdown of economic activities in FY21 in wake of Covid-19 only made matters worse.As lockdowns started to ease and business activities resumed, India's GDP also started rising. In Q1 of FY22, growth jumped to 20.1% mainly on account of low base effect. By the fourth quarter of FY22, growth came down to 4.10%.Similarly, the new financial year 2022-23 brought fresh economic challenges in the form of Russia-Ukraine war that impacted almost all major economies of the world, slowed the pace of growth, pushed inflation to record highs.As a result, the central banks of all advanced economies spurred into action and opted for monetary policy tightening to curb the soaring inflation.With persistently rising interest rates, India's economy grew by 4.4% in Q3 of FY23, as the Centre revised upwards GDP growth for previous year to 9.10% from 8.7% earlier.The report weighed recent GDP numbers against the available data on savings and investments for the past decade and highlighted some interesting points.""Quarterly growth numbers are noisy and should be best avoided for any serious interpretation (on an average, India's GDP growth has witnessed Rs 2 lakh crore upward revision for the 3 year ended FY23),"" the report said.Gross capital formation (GCF) by the government touched a high of 11.8% in 2021-22, up from 10.7% in 2020-21.""This also had a domino effect on private sector investment that jumped from 10 per cent to 10.8% over the same period,"" it said.In fact, Ecowrap added that the trends in GCF to gross output ratio or the plough back of funds for creation of fresh capacity shows that for public administration the ratio attained fresh peak in 2021-22 owing to the emphasis on capital expenditure in recent budgets.At the aggregate level, gross capital formation is supposed to have crossed 32% in 2022-23, the highest level since 2018-19.According to the report, in 2021-22, gross savings have risen to 30% from 29% in 2020-21.""The ratio is supposed to have crossed 31 per cent in 2022-23, the highest since 2018-19. The household savings increased sharply during the pandemic period on account of sharp accretion in financial savings such as deposits,"" said the report by SBI's Economic Research Department.While household financial savings have since then moderated from 15.4% in 2020-21 to 11.1% in 2022-23, savings in physical assets have grown sharply to 11.8% in 2021-22 from 10.7% in 2020-21.The report further analysed Incremental Capital Output ratio (ICOR) -- which measures additional units of capital (investment) needed to produce additional units of output. It said that the ratio has been improving.""ICOR which was 7.5 in FY 12 is now only 3.5 in FY22. Clearly, only half of capital is now needed for next unit of output,"" the report noted.Such reducing ICOR in the current years reflects a relatively increasing efficiency of capital and shows that the economy is on a sound footing, the report said.""From that point of view, future GDP growth rates even at 7% could still mean a decent number by any standards!,"" it added.","India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%. Raghuram Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying""","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-98483158,imgsize-65724,width-400,resizemode-4/98483158.jpg"
"Find less costly ways to address pension concerns instead of OPS, says Raghuram Rajan",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/find-less-costly-ways-to-address-pension-concerns-instead-of-ops-says-raghuram-rajan/articleshow/98457871.cms,"NEW DELHI: Former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan has expressed his concern over the decision of some states to restart the old pension scheme and suggested that some less costly ways should be found to address the demands of government pensioners.Rajan further said the old pension scheme does involve massive future outlays because of the indexation of pensions to current salaries.""This is an enormous obligation, not necessarily in the short run, but in the long run,"" he said, adding obviously, state governments have to think through the long-term implications for government finances, and whether civil servants are the most in need of help among the constituencies they deal with.Rajan, currently Katherine Dusak Miller Distinguished Service Professor of Finance at The University of Chicago Booth School of Business, said as he understands it, it may be infeasible technically or legally to move back to the old pension scheme.""If so, there may be less costly ways of addressing the concerns that prompt such moves,"" Rajan told PTI in an email interview.In a major move, a select group of central government employees have been given a one-time option to opt for old pension scheme.The employees who joined the central government services against posts advertised or notified before December 22, 2003, the day National Pension System ( NPS ) was notified, are eligible to join the old pension scheme under the Central Civil Services (Pension) Rules, 1972 (now 2021).Under Old Pension Scheme (OPS), employees get a defined pension. An employee is entitled for a 50 per cent amount of the last drawn salary as pension.OPS was discontinued by the NDA government in 2003 with effect from April 1, 2004.Under the new pension scheme (NPS), employees contribute 10 per cent of their basic salary towards pension while the government contributes 14 per cent.Governments of Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand have informed the central government/ Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA about their decision to restart OPS for their employees.The government of Punjab on November 18, 2022, issued a notification regarding implementation of OPS for the state government employees who are being covered under NPS. Jharkhand too has decided to revert to OPS.",Former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan has expressed his concern over the decision of some states to restart the old pension scheme.

NEW DELHI: Consumption of petrol, diesel and jet fuel continued to gallop apace in February, prompted by early onset of summer and harvesting pushing up demand from the farm sector and increased mobility prompted by expanding economic activities.Early trade data shows petrol consumption rising 13%, diesel 12% and jet fuel almost 41% over the same month a year ago. Consumption of LPG , mostly used by households for cooking, grew maintained the usual modest growth at 2.4%.The growth in consumption was substantially higher than in the same month of 2021 when the economy began firing up after the pandemic.

Since diesel a key indicator economic activities, this indicates lingering pandemic overhang.In contrast, petrol sales show a sharp uptick at 20% versus February 2020 as people’s preference for personal vehicles during the post-pandemic unlock period continues as reflected in robust automobile sales.Similarly, jet fuel sales have gradually recovered but still remains 10% short of the February 2020 level, indicating some resistance at this level. Industry is banking on the summer travel season for full recovery.Sequentially also, the sales in February were higher by 13.5% for petrol, 9.2% for diesel and just 3.3% for jet fuel, the data shows.Early onset of summer and absence of winter rains have pushed up demand from the farm sector due to increased use of diesel pumps for irrigating late standing crops such as mustard. Harvesting in states that have early harvesting further boosted the demand.","Petrol consumption rose 13%, diesel 12% and jet fuel almost 41% over the same month a year ago.

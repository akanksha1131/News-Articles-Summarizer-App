China Suspends Boeing Deliveries as US Trade War Escalates With New Tariffs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/china-orders-halt-to-boeing-jet-deliveries-from-as-trade-war-with-us-intensifies/articleshow/120305185.cms,"Representative image/AI generated

Amid the ongoing trade conflict with the United States of America, China has told its airlines not to take any more deliveries of Boeing Co planes, Bloomberg reported. This move follows US President Donald Trump's decision to impose tariffs of up to 145 per cent on Chinese goods.Chinese carriers have also been asked to stop buying aircraft-related equipment and parts from US companies, sources were quoted as saying by the Bloomberg.The order came after China announced retaliatory tariffs of 125 per cent on American goods over the weekend. These new tariffs would more than double the cost of US-made aircraft and parts, making it difficult for Chinese airlines to continue accepting Boeing planes.China is also looking into ways to help airlines that lease Boeing jets and are now facing higher expenses due to the tariffs, the Bloomberg report said, quoting sources.The trade conflict between the US and China has placed Boeing in a difficult position. The situation remains uncertain and could change. President Trump has reversed some tariffs in the past, including those on Apple Inc.’s iPhones imported from China.The standoff marks another challenge for Boeing in one of the largest markets for aircraft sales.China is expected to account for 20 per cent of global aircraft demand over the next 20 years. In 2018, almost 25 per cent of Boeing’s aircraft were delivered to China, the Bloomberg report said. However, Boeing has not announced any major new orders from China in recent years, mainly because of trade tensions and internal problems.China was the first country to ground the 737 Max in 2019 after two fatal crashes. Trade disagreements during both the Trump and Biden administrations have also led China to shift more of its aircraft purchases to Airbus SE, a European manufacturer. In 2024, Boeing faced another issue when a door plug came off during a flight in January, raising further concerns about quality.The situation also shows that China still depends on foreign companies to meet its growing need for passenger aircraft.",China has told its airlines not to take any more deliveries of Boeing Co planes.

Indian markets ended the day in green on Wednesday, continuing their two-day winning streak. Benchmark indices closed with modest gains on the back of positive domestic macroeconomic numbers.BSE Sensex closed at 77,044.29, up 309.40 points or 0.40%, while Nifty also gained 108.65 points or 0.47%, reaching 23,437.20. Indian equity markets had begun the trading week on a strong note, with benchmark indices rising sharply on Tuesday following a market holiday on Monday. The Sensex soared over 1,600 points to close at 76,734.02, while the Nifty50 ended at a record high of 23,328.50.This momentum was set off by strong global cues , a return of domestic investor confidence, and hopes that US trade hostilities, especially concerning semiconductor tariffs , may temporarily ease.The rupee also sustained its rally for the third straight session and settled with a gain of 12 paise at 85.68 (provisional) against the US dollar on Wednesday, boosted by the renewed inflow of foreign funds and a weak American currency. Domestic Institutional Investors (DIIs) remained net buyers, offsetting Foreign Institutional Investor (FII) outflows. Over Rs 25,000 crore in SIP contributions during March also underlined steady retail participation despite tight liquidity.Markets were particularly encouraged by US President Donald Trump ’s recent indication that his administration may temporarily ease trade restrictions, particularly in the semiconductor and electronics sectors.US customs authorities have announced temporary duty exemptions on key consumer and industrial electronics, including semiconductors. Though these measures are not permanent, they have reassured markets in the short term. However, Trump has signalled that fresh tariffs may be introduced within weeks.On the global front, markets have been swinging as investors react to renewed trade tensions between the US and China.Nvidia’s announcement that it would need a US licence to ship its latest AI chips to China rattled investor confidence across Asian markets.The firm’s shares tumbled around 6% in after-hours trade, and suppliers like TSMC, SK hynix and Advantest saw notable losses. Broader indices reflected the turmoil, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng fell 1.8%, while Tokyo’s Nikkei and Shanghai Composite each dropped 0.7%.Trump’s aggressive stance has deepened global uncertainty. New probes into critical minerals and a temporary exemption on chip-related tariffs have left investors guessing about the longer-term trajectory of trade policy.Trump reiterated that China must “come to the table,” while reports suggest Beijing has paused aircraft orders from Boeing, a sign of fraying commercial ties.Yet, global equities held relatively steady on Tuesday with the Dow up 0.78%, Nasdaq 0.64%, and the S&P 500 gaining 0.79%, thanks to strong earnings in banking and speculation that the worst of trade war shocks may be behind, at least temporarily.Meanwhile, China's Q1 GDP beat expectations, rising 5.4% year-on-year, but officials warned of “certain pressures” from rising tariffs and a complicated external environment. Analysts say much of China’s export strength in March was “front-loaded” to beat tariff deadlines, raising doubts about sustained momentum.","BSE Sensex closed at 77,044.29, up 309.40 points or 0.40%.

Delhi IGI Airport T2 to shut for repairs from April 15; flights to shift to T1,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/igi-airport-t2-to-shut-for-repairs-from-tomorrow-flights-to-shift-to-t1/articleshow/120272573.cms,"IGI Airport (File photo)

NEW DELHI: Terminal 2 of Delhi Airport will be shut for repairs on April 15 for about four months and Terminal 1 will finally start operating at 100% capacity. Airlines operating flights from this all-domestic terminal will shift to T1. These include IndiGo and Akasa among others.In a statement, IndiGo said "" effective April 15, 2025, all its flights arriving to and departing from Terminal 2 will operate to/from Terminal 1. With implementation of this change, IndiGo will now operate from Terminal 1 and Terminal 3 of Indira Gandhi International Airport, New Delhi.""IndiGo says it has ""taken proactive measures to ensure that its customers are well-informed about this change. The airline is reaching out to all passengers and their respective travel agents through SMS, calls, and emails to notify them. IndiGo recommends retrieving PNR on the airline's website or mobile app to check departure / arrival terminal before heading to the airport.""Akasa said: ""Starting April 15, 2025, all our flights to and from Delhi will operate from Terminal 1 (1D) of Indira Gandhi International Airport, Delhi.Please your check your flight status before proceeding to the airport.""Delhi Airport said: ""Attention Passengers: Effective April 15, 2025 (0001 hrs), all flights currently operating from Terminal 2 will shift to Terminal 1 until further notice.""Delhi International Airport Ltd (DIAL) has begun conducting trials for transferring check-in baggage of connecting passengers between T3 (IGIA’s only international terminal) and the all domestic T1. This week T1 will get fully operational and then T2 will be shut for repairs. However with an air train still a few years away, transfers between T3 & T1 — at a time when connecting traffic is on the rise thanks to massive network expansion by Air India group and IndiGo — remain a major pain point for passengers. To make domestic-international or vice versa transfers between T3 & T1 little less painful, DIAL plans to ensure baggage of some connecting passengers gets transferred on the airside without them being required to carry the same with them on buses.As of now, international arrivals at Delhi airport have to complete their immigration and customs clearance have to check-in baggage again for connecting flights. “DIAL is conducting trials for smooth transfer of cabin baggage from T3 to T1 for passengers arriving from international destinations and having a connecting flight from T1,” DIAL CEO Videh Kumar Jaipuriar said last Friday. Jaipuriar said once the new system is implemented, then, after customs clearance, passengers will not have to carry baggage to T1. They can drop the baggage at T3, and the airline concerned will transfer it to T1 through the airside, Jaipuriar said.DIAL has told the civil aviation ministry that transfer of passengers for connecting flights from T1 to T3 will be completed in 120 minutes. The number of transfer traffic is expected to rise and with the 7-km apart T1 & T3 not connected by an air train, smooth connections are a distant dream as of now. “We have committed to Govt that it will be ensured passengers coming out of T1 can board a flight in T3 in 120 minutes,” he said.",Terminal 2 of Delhi Airport will be shut for repairs on April 15 for about four months.

WTO slashes global trade outlook on tariff jitters,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/wto-slashes-global-trade-outlook-on-tariff-jitters/articleshow/120363800.cms,"The World Trade Organization slashed its forecast for merchandise trade this year as soaring US tariffs and broader uncertainty hammer international commerce. The Geneva-based WTO expects the volume of world merchandise trade to decline by 0.2% in 2025 - almost three percentage points lower than it would have been without the US-led trade war, marking a dramatic reversal from expectations at the start of the year. Trade is forecast to rebound by 2.5% in 2026.Two weeks ago, Trump announced reciprocal import taxes ranging from 10% to 50%, though days later he suspended the highest rates for 90 days and kept 10% as the floor for all countries except China, whose exports to the US now face duties in excess of 100%. The reprieve was aimed at giving bilateral negotiations time to play out, and a delegation from Japan is visiting the White House for talks on Wednesday.In the WTO's forecasts, this year's contraction will be even worse if the US pushes ahead with those higher levels of reciprocal tariffs. ""Together, reciprocal tariffs and spreading trade policy uncertainty would lead to a 1.5% decline in world merchandise trade in 2025,"" the WTO said in its report Wednesday.While protectionist policies may boost domestic production, raise revenue and narrow trade imbalances - all three of which are Trump's stated goals - the WTO said that ""over the medium to long term, higher import tariffs generally have net negative effect on economic activity and trade.""",The World Trade Organization slashed its forecast for merchandise trade this year.

Top stock market recommendations Nifty has covered over 1700 points from its opening low printed on last Monday, in a matter of 5 sessions. The index is now on the verge of turning positive again for the month as it is still few points in the red on an MTD basis. This double bottom bounce back has been stronger than its last month’s recovery from sub 22000 levels as the market digests a rut cut by the RBI along with easing trade war tensions by US with other countries of the world. With reclamation of 22800-22900 zone on a closing basis the index has turned back to a buy on dip for the medium term and is eyeing to scale back above 24000. There is a gap between 23200 – 22900 on daily charts which can be used as the range to buy on dip for the forthcoming leg upside.Bank Nifty has been the star outperformer in this ongoing correction while the index has broadly held on to its wide range from the start of this calendar year.With tariff fears creating a strong set back on global markets, its impact on Indian indices also pulled leading indices back to its March 2025 lows. However, Bank Nifty stood out strongly, reversing after a 61.8% retracement. We had highlighted a buy on dip level between 49900 and 50400 for targets of 52500 on the upside. This has been complete as of today while the outperformance on Bank Nifty v/s Nifty looks overbought in the short term. With the index now at 4 month high, a consolidation here between 51800 – 53200 looks possible with Nifty now taking charge for upside.IRCTC has given a breakout from a falling trendline which has been in place for the past 10 months now. Adding to this, stock has also closed at a 2 month high on daily charts confirming the end of this 10 month long correction seen on the scrip. Though this breakout allows a based formation and higher targets for the medium term on this monopoly scrip, for now we are looking at a quick 8-10% upside.QSR stocks had been sliding since the start of this calendar year. Marking an end to the slide, Jubilant FoodWorks has given a breakout of a 3 month long correction while making a higher bottom formation all through the past 4 weeks. A quick 6-8% upside follows through this breakout on the stock.Stocks making highs in a market crash, are generally the ones witnessing significant flows and lesser outflows in comparison to the widely traded names. Current strength seen on Shree Cement is likely to extend for another 8-10% given the market reversal being formed on charts. A support seen at yesterday’s low is an ideal risk reward to be played for the upside. Stock is likely to breakout to new all time highs.","According to Aakash K Hindocha, Deputy Vice President - WM Research, IRCTC, Jubilant FoodWorks and Shree Cement are the top buy calls for today.

Asian markets mostly high

US Wall Street experienced a significant sell-off on Wednesday, accompanied by a declining dollar, following pessimistic remarks from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and concerns over semiconductor company Nvidia . The market atmosphere shifted from its previous stability, prompting investors to seek refuge in gold, which surpassed $3,300 per ounce.Despite positive retail sales figures, US equities declined. The downturn intensified after Powell expressed concerns about Trump's tariffs potentially forcing the Federal Reserve to make difficult decisions regarding inflation and unemployment management.Powell indicated that whilst employment and inflation objectives were currently balanced, policymakers might face a ""challenging scenario"" as circumstances evolve. ""Tariffs are highly likely to generate at least a temporary rise in inflation,"" Powell told the Economic Club of Chicago, warning that the inflationary effects ""could also be more persistent."" US stocks reached their lowest points following Powell's statement, with slight recovery near trading close. The Nasdaq declined over three per cent while closing. Meanwhile, Nvidia shares dropped approximately 7 per cent, having earlier fallen more than 10 per cent.The company revealed potential losses of $5.5 billion related to export licence restrictions for technology potentially utilisable in Chinese supercomputers.Jack Ablin of Cresset Capital noted that Powell's comments raised stagflation concerns and transformed a moderate decline into a substantial market drop.The dollar also weakened considerably against the euro following Powell's statements.

This comes after Japan entered key trade talks with the US as President Trump pushes for quick deals amid global tariff tensions. Trump, directly involved in the negotiations, seeks to reduce the $68.5 billion trade deficit and secure more access for US goods. Japan, facing tariffs up to 25% on cars and metals, is cautious about making concessions. Prime Minister Ishiba’s team hopes for a fair outcome, while Trump also presses Japan on defense cost-sharing. The outcome may shape global trade dynamics as China, facing upto 245% tariffs from US, promotes itself as a more stable partner.South Korea's Kospi index advanced 0.41%, and the small-cap Kosdaq rose 1.13%, following the central bank's decision to maintain interest rates at 2.75%, aligning with economists' expectations in a Reuters poll.","US Wall Street experienced a significant sell-off on Wednesday, accompanied by a declining dollar.

However, the trends were quite different. During the last fiscal year, with the US, India saw its exports rise by 11.6% to $86.5 billion, while imports rose at a slower pace of 7.4% to $45.3 billion, resulting in a higher trade surplus of $41 billion - not the best news when Donald Trump is seeking to narrow it.In contrast, India's trade deficit with China neared the $100 billion mark, due to a fall in exports to $14.2 billion, while imports jumped 11.5% on an already high base to close the year at $113.5 billion. In fact, China is now India's fifth biggest export destination, slipping one place as the UK rose to number four, provisional data released by the commerce department showed.A bulk of the fall in exports was due to lower ore exports, particularly iron. According to the latest disaggregated data available from April to Jan 2024-25, the export of ores almost halved to $1.5 billion. Although the level of imports was lower, similar trends were seen in the case of iron and steel and aluminium. The value of cotton shipments from India also dropped from $725 million during April-Jan 2023-24 to $192 million during the first 10 months of the last financial year.In case of the US, a major chunk of the growth in exports was due to more smartphones, particularly iPhones, making their way into Apple stores.The growth in Indian smartphone production also meant that smartphone imports from China crashed 70% to $252 million. However, electronic components jumped.When it came to other imports, Chinese-made computers were among the biggest items in the basket, while machinery was huge - from those going to air conditioners to those used for embroidery. Surprisingly, during April to Jan, the import of photovoltaic cells dropped around 20% to $2.4 billion, while lithium-ion imports were marginally lower at $1.8 billion.","During the last fiscal year, with the US, India saw its exports rise by 11.6% to $86.5 billion.

HYDERABAD: Escalation in US-China tariff war sent gold prices soaring past the $3,300/ounce mark for the first time in international spot markets on Wednesday, catapulting the yellow metal to a new high of $3,318, pushing it to within touching distance of the Rs 1 lakh/10 gm (24K) mark in the Indian market.The price surge sent the precious metal racing to all-time highs in the domestic markets. Gold shot past the Rs 98,000-mark in Delhi where it was quoting at Rs 98,100 by evening. On MCX too, gold reached an all-time high of Rs 95,435 for June futures.""Gold rose to a new record high, surpassing the previous all-time peak set on Monday. Traders were whip-lashed again by a slew of tariff headlines; in the latest, US President Donald Trump ordered a probe into critical minerals, sparking a move toward safe haven assets,"" said Saumil Gandhi of HDFC Securities.The skyrocketing prices have, however, significantly dampened consumer appetite for the gold, which is selling at a discount to the import prices in local markets, pointed out Avinash Gupta, vice-chairman, All India Gem & Jewellery Domestic Council.""Since the dip in prices to $2,982 on April 8, gold has shot up by $336/oz, an 11% increase in just the past eight days. This is the fastest rise in gold prices in a span of eight days, which confirms the parabolic movement in gold.Because of this steep price rise, gold is selling at a discounted price of 1-2% of the actual landing cost in India,"" Gupta said.Surendra Mehta, national secretary, India Bullion and Jewellers' Association, said the phenomenon has led to an unprecedented situation where there are more consumers walking in to sell gold to either book profits or to exchange old gold for new than those trooping in just to buy the precious metal.Gupta said: ""Whenever prices go up so drastically, consumer sentiments do take a beating, impacting retail sales. But in this case I suspect those who have run up losses on the stock markets may be booking profits in gold to offset their losses.""However, at a time when the ongoing US-China trade wars have set gold prices on fire, silver has failed to match pace. On Wednesday, international spot prices for the white metal were at $32.8/oz and crossed the Rs 1 lakh/kg mark in the Delhi spot markets.""The demand for silver is primarily driven by industrial demand but the tariff wars are threatening to spark off a recession. If these trade wars settle down, silver is the only metal that will rise at a quick pace,"" Gupta said.The rally in gold may well run further with experts saying they expect the bullish momentum to continue.","Escalation in US-China tariff war sent gold prices soaring past the $3,300/ounce mark.

Bank of Canada keeps interest rates steady after seven continuous cuts,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/bank-of-canada-keeps-interest-rates-steady-after-seven-continuous-cuts/articleshow/120352047.cms,"The Bank of Canada paused its recent streak of interest rate cuts , holding the benchmark rate at 2.75% on Wednesday. The decision came after seven consecutive reductions since summer, aimed at lowering borrowing costs.However, rising global trade tensions have forced a more cautious approach.The central bank attributed the decision to “major shift in direction of US trade policy and the unpredictability of tariffs” explaining that these developments have “increased uncertainty, diminished prospects for economic growth, and raised inflation expectations.”The Canadian economy had started the year on a strong note, after ending the previous year with robust growth and inflation easing towards the bank’s 2 percent target. However, fresh waves of tariffs and erratic policy signals from US President Donald Trump have cast a shadow over the global economic outlook.While Canada was spared the most recent batch of tariffs announced on 2 April, it continues to face levies on steel, aluminium, some car models, and goods deemed non-compliant with the North American free trade pact. Trump has also threatened to expand the list to include lumber, semiconductors and pharmaceutical products.“A lot has happened since our March decision five weeks ago. But the future is no clearer,” said Bank of Canada governor Tiff Macklem. “We still do not know what tariffs will be imposed, whether they'll be reduced or escalated, or how long all of this will last.”He added that the central bank would wait for more clarity before considering its next move in June.Economists are split on what comes next. Avery Shenfeld of CIBC economics warned that if the Canadian economy shows signs of slowing in the coming months, the central bank will come under increasing pressure to cut rates again. Meanwhile, Royce Mendes of Desjardins struck a more hopeful tone, suggesting there is “some momentum behind the move towards better relations between the US and Canada.”Still, the Bank of Canada gave a dull outlook for the risks ahead, warning of a potential recession and surging prices, in case the trade war with the US continues. It also pointed to weakened financial markets, falling oil prices, and a stronger Canadian dollar driven by a broadly weaker US currency.The bank highlighted that consumer and business confidence dipped, dragging down spending, investment, and hiring. In the short term, it expects prices to rise due to supply disruptions and higher costs, but emphasised the need to stay the course.“Monetary policy cannot resolve trade uncertainty or offset the impacts of a trade war,” the bank said. “What it can and must do is maintain price stability for Canadians.”",The Bank of Canada held the benchmark rate at 2.75% on Wednesday.

Nvidia braces for $5.5 billion blow as Trump administration tightens grip on AI chip exports to China,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/nvidia-braces-for-5-5-billion-blow-as-trump-administration-tightens-grip-on-ai-chip-exports-to-china/articleshow/120329729.cms,"Nvidia warned that it expects a $5.5 billion hit to its revenue after the Trump administration blocked sales of its China-specific AI chips, a move that could reshape the global chip race and deepen the technology rift between the US and China.In a regulatory filing, Nvidia said it had been notified that the US government would now require a license to export its H20 chip to China — a chip it had designed to comply with earlier restrictions. The company said it would be unable to sell or fulfill existing H20 orders, prompting a multi-billion-dollar write-down of inventory and contracts.The decision comes just days after Nvidia pledged to invest $500 billion in US AI infrastructure — a move praised by the White House. But behind the scenes, the Trump administration had already informed the company it was tightening export controls.""This kills Nvidia's access to a key market,"" said Patrick Moorhead, an analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy. ""Chinese companies are just going to switch to Huawei.""The US Commerce Department confirmed the new export licensing requirements , which also apply to rival AMD’s MI308 chip. “We are committed to acting on the president's directive to safeguard our national and economic security,” spokesperson Benno Kass said.The blow lands as Nvidia faces rising pressure from Chinese firms like Huawei and DeepSeek, the latter of which recently unveiled a powerful AI model reportedly built at a fraction of the cost of its US counterparts.In 2023, China accounted for 13% of Nvidia's revenue, down from around 20% the year before. The H20 chip — a modified version of its flagship H100 — had been Nvidia’s attempt to salvage access to the Chinese market under existing restrictions.Now, even that window is closing.Notably, the crackdown follows a high-profile Mar-a-Lago dinner between Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Trump — a meeting that sparked speculation that the administration might ease its stance. Instead, pressure only mounted.Senator Elizabeth Warren urged the administration to act swiftly in a letter to Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, warning that Chinese tech giants were stockpiling chips while US startups struggled to acquire them.The fallout could be long-term. As Nvidia retreats from China, analysts warn that domestic players like Huawei could fill the vacuum — and emerge as global competitors.","N Nvidia warns it expects a $5.5 billion hit to its revenue after the Trump administration blocked sales of its China-specific AI chips.

10. Markets and Yuan largely unmoved by data

China's economy posted stronger-than-expected growth in the first quarter of 2025, offering a temporary boost before the full impact of newly imposed US tariffs begins to bite. According to data released Wednesday by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), gross domestic product rose 5.4% year-on-year in the first three months—above the 5.2% consensus forecast from economists surveyed by Bloomberg.But the celebratory tone is already fading. The data reflects conditions before April, when US President Donald Trump dramatically raised tariffs on Chinese imports, triggering retaliation from Beijing. With levies now as high as 145%, economists warn that China’s growth engine—exports—may stall, increasing pressure on policymakers to step in with stimulus.China’s economy expanded 5.4% in the first quarter compared to the same period a year ago. That performance exceeded both Bloomberg and Reuters forecasts and matched Q4’s pace. However, analysts say this resilience was largely front-loaded. ""Before the tariff storms hit, China's GDP growth likely eased but remained solid, thanks to the recovery in domestic demand,"" Societe Generale analysts noted.March industrial production rose 7.7% year-on-year, the fastest since June 2021.The surge is attributed to factories racing to fulfill overseas orders ahead of tariff hikes. “Industrial production was a beat but understandable after the strong export data. But that’s all in the past now,” said Michelle Lam, Greater China economist at Societe Generale.Retail sales climbed 5.9% in March, the best showing since December 2023 and well above expectations. “The most pleasant surprise is retail sales which shows that consumption subsidies are working,” Lam added. However, weak labor market confidence continues to constrain spending potential, especially as trade tensions weigh on job stability.Fixed-asset investment rose 4.2% in the first quarter, showing steady growth in infrastructure and manufacturing. But property investment fell sharply by 9.9%, reflecting ongoing distress in China’s real estate sector. The prolonged slump in housing continues to drag on broader economic momentum.China’s urban jobless rate fell to 5.2% in March from 5.4% in February. While the drop signals some improvement, analysts say the job market remains fragile and could deteriorate as export-oriented industries face shrinking orders.The NBS acknowledged the mounting risks in its statement: “The external environment is becoming more complex and severe... and the foundation for sustained economic recovery and growth is yet to be consolidated.” Economists expect rate cuts, lower bank reserve requirements, and trillions in fiscal stimulus in the coming months.The upbeat Q1 figures mask what analysts expect to be a sharp slowdown in the months ahead. Trump’s new tariff package lifted duties on most Chinese goods to 145%, triggering tit-for-tat retaliation by Beijing. “We think the tariff shock poses unprecedented challenges to China’s exports,” UBS analysts wrote in a recent downgrade of their growth forecast.March's export surge was seen as a temporary spike, driven by firms rushing to ship goods before tariffs hit. With levies now active, April and May are likely to show a sharp pullback. “Trade activities have likely slowed rapidly this month as global companies paused orders and reduced production,” analysts warned.UBS cut its 2025 growth forecast for China to 3.4% from 4%, while Goldman Sachs and Citigroup have also issued downward revisions. Without major stimulus, Beijing could miss its 5% growth target for the year. The tariff shock has amplified pre-existing weaknesses, including sluggish demand and rising debt.Despite the better-than-expected data, Chinese stocks remained under pressure. The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index fell as much as 2.4%, while the CSI 300 dropped 0.8%. The yuan held steady at 7.3236 in offshore trading, reflecting muted investor optimism amid geopolitical tensions and economic uncertainty.(With inputs from agencies)","China's economy posted stronger-than-expected growth in the first quarter of 2025.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.","Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain.

Testify: Sam Bankman-Fried acknowledges 'mistakes' but testifies he did not defraud anyone,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/cryptocurrency/sam-bankman-fried-acknowledges-mistakes-but-testifies-he-did-not-defraud-anyone/articleshow/104761929.cms,"<p>Sam Bankman-Fried (File Photo- Reuters)<br></p>

NEW YORK: Sam Bankman-Fried , testifying in his own defense at his fraud trial on Friday, acknowledged that a ""lot of people got hurt"" when the FTX cryptocurrency exchange he founded collapsed, but said he did not defraud anyone or take customer funds.Shortly after taking the witness stand in Manhattan federal court, Bankman-Fried said he made ""a number of small mistakes and a number of larger mistakes"" while running the now-bankrupt exchange. The biggest mistake, he said, was not implementing a dedicated risk management team.""We thought that we might be able to build the best product on the market,"" Bankman-Fried said. ""It turned out basically the opposite of that. A lot of people got hurt - customers, employees - and the company ended up in bankruptcy.""Prosecutors accuse Bankman-Fried of using FTX customer funds to prop up his crypto-focused hedge fund, Alameda Research, make speculative venture investments and donate more than $100 million to US political campaigns. He also faces charges of scheming to cheat Alameda's lenders and FTX investors.He has pleaded not guiltyBankman-Fried's trial, which began on October 3, is drawing to a close nearly a year after FTX collapsed amid a wave of customer withdrawals. The company declared bankruptcy in November 2022 and Bankman-Fried was indicted the following month.His testimony marked the first time the dozen jurors and five alternates have heard directly from the 31-year-old former billionaire after 12 trial days.Bankman-Fried, who was jailed in August after US District Judge Lewis Kaplan found he likely tampered with witnesses, wore a suit and spoke with two water bottles placed in front of him on the witness stand. The former mogul once known for wearing shorts and T-shirts and sporting an unkempt mop of curly locks cut his hair before his trial began.Responding to questions posed by his defense lawyer Mark Cohen, Bankman-Fried spoke in calm, measured tones during the first portion of his testimony as he recounted founding Alameda in 2017, shortly after graduating from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, despite knowing little about crypto.But Bankman-Fried - who had studied physics and worked as a quantitative trader at Jane Street - said he saw opportunities for ""arbitrage"" in the market for digital assets. He said Alameda's first office was in a small Airbnb in Berkeley, California, before he later moved the firm to Hong Kong.""We wanted to be under the radar at that point in time,"" he said on the stand, adding he named the hedge fund after the California county where it was founded in part so competitors would not discover what they were doing.Jurors have heard from three of his closest confidantes at FTX and Alameda, all of whom have pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors. They testified earlier this month that they committed financial crimes at Bankman-Fried's behest.For criminal defendants, taking the stand is a risky proposition because it opens them up to potentially probing cross-examination by prosecutors.But given Bankman-Fried's penchant for risk, legal experts say he likely viewed taking the stand as his best shot to counter the allegations made by members of his inner circle, which were backed up by spreadsheets the three said demonstrated how customer funds were stolen and text messages in which they discussed FTX's shortfall of funds with Bankman-Fried.","Sam Bankman-Fried says he made ""a number of small mistakes and a number of larger mistakes"" while running the now-bankrupt exchange. The biggest mistake, he said, was not implementing a dedicated risk management team.

"Crypto isn’t dead, it’s evolving rapidly to create a new world",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/cryptocurrency/crypto-isnt-dead-its-evolving-rapidly-to-create-a-new-world/articleshow/101324954.cms,"Regulatory landscape



There are few technologies as confusing to most people as crypto and blockchain. The tech and regulations underpinning it are evolving so rapidly, it is difficult for even technologists to often make sense of it.Crypto assets and crypto currencies are based on blockchain tech, which is a form of distributed ledger technology that stores data on thousands of data servers around the world, as opposed to today where data is stored only in one place or clustered in a few locations. This data is open, meaning it can be viewed and verified by anyone taking part in that particular system. What this means practically is that an individual can transfer crypto assets without the help of intermediaries, say, banks or government agencies, thereby ensuring privacy, speed and lower costs.The first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin , was created with anonymity in mind, it was a way for people to conduct financial transactions away from the prying eyes of governments. While it went on to become a speculative asset, today, crypto, and the underlying blockchain technology, has a far more ambitious goal – the transformation of the internet.CoinDCX CTO Vivek Gupta says this technology can help usher in Web 3. 0 – a decentralised form of the internet where users can actually monetise their time spent online. “Whatever Web3 use case you may be driving, the value that comes from it must be distributed, and you cannot distribute that without crypto. For something as simple as depositing money in a pool and getting a receipt token, that receipt token is a crypto. That’s the proof that I have deposited the money. Without crypto there is no Web3 use case,” he says.Decentralised finance (DeFi) is a huge part of what makes blockchain tech so disruptive. Imagine being able to lend your money to strangers on the internet and get paid an interest. Or imagine spending time on socialmedia platforms or playing video games and getting paid for your time spent by someone who needs data about you. Web3 makes this possible because the data isn’t controlled by any one company or country.Decentralised apps (dApps) are another Web3 feature. Unlike traditional apps hosted on centralised servers, dApps operate on a peer-to-peer network and utilisethe consensus mechanism and transparency features of blockchain technology.“I see a big disruption coming, especially in the DeFi tokenisation space and the whole content creator economy,” says Ravi Chamria, co-founder & CEO of Zeeve, a blockchain automation platform.Ashish Singhal, co-founder & CEO of CoinSwitch, says the tech can revolutionise how we conduct business, store data, and even vote, since the tech allows people to verify data of any kind efficiently.Governments are worried about what crypto could mean for monetary policy, for their ability to regulate people’s lives. But disruption hardly ever requires consensus. If a new technology proves to be better than an old one, people will drift towards it.Central banks have recognised the importance of the technology and some are creating Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) that are based on blockchain technology. “There’s a lot of activity happening in the regulated DeFi space. Looking at the future, we think guardrails are probably a good thing to have around these sorts of technologies,” says Andrew Vranjes, VP of sales at Blockdaemon, a blockchain infrastructure platform.Cryptocurrencies too are rapidly changing. Where before the value of cryptocurrencies were based on what people were willing to pay for them, today there are crypto assets that are backed by real world assets like equity and real estate. Silvina Moschini’s Unicoin is one of them. “It is an assets backed, audited, SEC-compliant cryptocurrency,” she says.","Crypto assets and crypto currencies are based on blockchain tech, which is a form of distributed ledger technology that stores data on thousands of data servers around the world.

"US tightens crackdown on crypto with lawsuits against Coinbase, Binance",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/cryptocurrency/bitcoin/us-tightens-crackdown-on-crypto-with-lawsuits-against-coinbase-binance/articleshow/100810119.cms,"BROKER, EXCHANGE CRACKDOWN



NEW YORK: The top U.S. securities regulator sued cryptocurrency platform Coinbase on Tuesday, the second lawsuit in two days against a major crypto exchange, in a dramatic escalation of a crackdown on the industry and one that could dramatically transform a market that has largely operated outside regulation.The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Monday took aim at Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange. The SEC accuses Binance and its CEO Changpeng Zhao of operating a ""web of deception"".If successful, the lawsuits could transform the crypto market by successfully asserting the SEC's jurisdiction over the industry which for years has argued that tokens do not constitute securities and should not be regulated by the SEC.""The two cases are different, but overlap and point in the same direction: the SEC's increasingly aggressive campaign to bring cryptocurrencies under the jurisdiction of the federal securities laws,"" said Kevin O'Brien, a partner at Ford O'Brien Landy and a former federal prosecutor, adding, however, that the SEC has not previously taken on such major crypto players.""If the SEC prevails in either case, the cryptocurrency industry will be transformed.""In its complaint filed in Manhattan federal court, the SEC said Coinbase has since at least 2019 made billions of dollars by operating as a middleman on crypto transactions, while evading disclosure requirements meant to protect investors.The SEC said Coinbase traded at least 13 crypto assets that are securities that should have been registered, including tokens such as Solana, Cardano and Polygon.Coinbase suffered about $1.28 billion of net customer outflows following the lawsuit, according to initial estimates from data firm Nansen. Shares of Coinbase's parent Coinbase Global Inc closed down $7.10, or 12.1%, at $51.61 after earlier falling as much as 20.9%. They are up 46% this year.Paul Grewal, Coinbase's general counsel, in a statement said the company will continue operating as usual and has ""demonstrated commitment to compliance.""Oanda senior market analyst Ed Moya said the SEC ""looks like it's playing Whac-A-Mole with crypto exchanges,"" and because most exchanges offer a range of tokens that operate on blockchain protocols targeted by regulators, ""it seems like this is just the beginning.""Leading cryptocurrency bitcoin has been a paradoxical beneficiary of the crackdown.After an initial plunge to a nearly three-month low of $25,350 following the Binance suit, bitcoin rebounded by more than $2,000, exceeding the previous day's high. It was trading just below $27,000 at 0410 GMT.""The SEC is making life nearly impossible for several altcoins and that is actually driving some crypto traders back into bitcoin,"" explained Oanda's Moya.Securities, as opposed to other assets such as commodities, are strictly regulated and require detailed disclosures to inform investors of potential risks. The Securities Act of 1933 outlined a definition of the term ""security,"" yet many experts rely on two U.S. Supreme Court cases to determine if an investment product constitutes a security.SEC Chair Gary Gensler has long said tokens constitute securities and has steadily asserted its authority over the crypto market, focusing initially on the sale of tokens and interest-bearing crypto products. More recently, it has taken aim at unregistered crypto broker dealer, exchange trading and clearing activity.While a few crypto companies are licensed as alternative system trading systems, a type of trading platform used by brokers to trade listed securities, no crypto platform operates as a full-blown stock exchange. The SEC also this year sued Beaxy Digital and Bittrex Global for failing to register as an exchange, clearing house and broker.""The whole business model is built on a noncompliance with the U.S. securities laws and we're asking them to come into compliance,"" Gensler told CNBC.Crypto companies refute that tokens meet the definition of a security, say the SEC's rules are ambiguous, and that the SEC is overstepping its authority in trying to regulate them. Still, many companies have boosted compliance, shelved products and expanded outside the country in response to the crackdown.Kristin Smith, CEO of the Blockchain Association trade group, rejected Gensler's efforts to oversee the industry.""We're confident the courts will prove Chair Gensler wrong in due time,"" she said.Founded in 2012, Coinbase recently served more than 108 million customers and ended March with $130 billion of customer crypto assets and funds on its balance sheet. Transactions generated 75% of its $3.15 billion of net revenue last year.Tuesday's SEC lawsuit seeks civil fines, the recouping of ill-gotten gains and injunctive relief.On Monday, the SEC accused Binance of inflating trading volumes, diverting customer funds, improperly commingling assets, failing to restrict U.S. customers from its platform, and misleading customers about its controls.Binance pledged to vigorously defend itself against the lawsuit, which it said reflected the SEC's ""misguided and conscious refusal"" to provide clarity to the crypto industry.Customers pulled around $790 million from Binance and its U.S. affiliate following the lawsuit, Nansen said.On Tuesday, the SEC filed a motion to freeze assets belonging to Binance.US, Binance's U.S. affiliate. The holding company of Binance is based in the Cayman Islands.""It's important to note that recent regulatory actions are aimed at ensuring that companies operating in the cryptocurrency industry are complying with securities laws and protecting investors - this will always be their goal,"" said Joshua Chu, group chief risk officer at blockchain technology firms XBE, Coinllectibles and Marvion.""These events will ultimately lead to a more stable and trustworthy industry, which could help to attract more institutional investors and mainstream adoption.""","The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Monday took aim at Binance.

Cryptoverse: Bitcoin miners escape the bear trap,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/cryptocurrency/bitcoin/cryptoverse-bitcoin-miners-escape-the-bear-trap/articleshow/99577419.cms,"OUT OF THE WOODS?



Beleaguered bitcoin miners are finally feeling the spring sunshine after a cold, hard crypto winter .The power-hungry companies that pump new bitcoin into circulation have been thrown a lifeline by the cryptocurrency's rally to above $30,000 this year, which has conspired with falling electricity prices to boost their profitability.The 30-day average of mining revenues has risen to $27.34 million a day, the highest level since last June, according to data from Blockchain.com.That's a relief for miners that struggled to service large debt burdens as revenues languished between $15 million and $21 million for most of the second half of 2022. They're still some way off a peak of $61.2 million hit in November 2021, though.""Many public miners were on the brink of bankruptcy at the end of last year. At the current bitcoin price, these companies' cash flows have substantially improved and most of them should have no problem paying their obligations,"" said Jaran Mellerud , analyst at bitcoin mining services company Luxor.Miners' debt-to-equity ratios now look much healthier, said Mellerud, adding that many companies had restructured and paid down debt over the past few months.Marathon Digital Holdings' debt-to-equity ratio has dropped to 0.5 from 2 since the start of this year, for example, while Greenidge Generation Holdings' has dropped to 5.8 from 11.7, according to data from Luxor.The spring thaw has seen investors flock back to publicly traded crypto mining companies; Among the biggest players, Marathon and Riot Platforms have seen their share price more than triple this year, while the Valkyrie Bitcoin Miners ETF is up 162% and Greenidge has gained 137%. But they've all still lost money since early 2022.Bitcoin mining is the process by which a network of computers validates a block of transactions on the blockchain. Miners are rewarded with bitcoin for completing a block, competing against other miners by solving intricate maths puzzles with energy-intensive computing systems, meaning electricity comprises a significant chunk of their operating costs.Declines in power prices, particularly in the U.S., have eased pressure on company margins, according to analysts at BTIG, who said the electricity cost for producing one bitcoin has fallen about 40% from the end of last year.That means that despite both the computing power available on the network and mining difficulty rising steadily to new all time highs - meaning it should take more power to mine one block - the 30-day average cost-per-transaction for miners has fallen to its lowest level since September, Blockchain.com data showed.Miners can't get too cozy though, given their fortunes are tied to bitcoin's capricious price trajectory.""If we see bitcoin top out and consolidate, the run-up in miners may do the same, we expect to see more volatility as we head into summer,"" said Kevin Kelly , head of research at Delphi Digital, although he sees a favorable environment for crypto persisting through 2023, compared with last year.Despite improvements in their balance sheets, many miners still have plenty of debt to pay down and are still struggling, said Luxor's Mellerud.""The bitcoin price increase has bought these companies time, but it would be detrimental for these companies if it were to fall back down to $20,000,"" he said.Most companies are focusing on debt reduction rather than spending on new equipment, BTIG said, even as the estimated cost of new mining rigs has dropped around 69% since the end of 2021.There are some exceptions however, with CleanSpark taking advantage of falling prices to purchase of 45,000 new mining rigs, which would nearly double its computing power.A rapid rise in power prices or a fast fall in bitcoin could usher in a new cold spell. For now though, the sun is shining.""I don't think we're completely out of the woods, but I think the worst is behind us,"" said Marcus Sotiriou , analyst at digital asset broker GlobalBlock.","The 30-day average of mining revenues has risen to $27.34 million a day, the highest level since last June. That's a relief for miners that struggled to service large debt burdens as revenues languished between $15 million and $21 million for most of 2022.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-99577406,imgsize-78328,width-400,resizemode-4/99577406.jpg"

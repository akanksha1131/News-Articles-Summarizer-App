Stock market crash today: Indian equity benchmark indices, Nifty50 and BSE Sensex , tanked in trade on Friday. While Nifty50 went below 24,850, BSE Sensex dropped over 700 points. Nifty50 ended the day at 24,837.00, down 225 points or 0.90%. BSE Sensex closed at 81,463.09, down 721 points.Financial stocks, particularly Bajaj Finance, led the downward trend amidst global market concerns and foreign investment patterns.The collective market value of BSE-listed firms decreased by Rs 4.75 lakh crore, settling at Rs 453.35 lakh crore, according to an ET report.The financial sector emerged as the primary contributor to the decline, with the Nifty Financial Services index declining over 1%. Bajaj Finance and Bajaj Finserv experienced significant drops of 5.5% and 4.5% respectively, following concerns regarding MSME segment asset quality, despite strong quarterly performance.Axis Bank, HDFC Bank, and Kotak Bank declined up to 1%. Bajaj Finance registered as the largest decliner among Nifty constituents.Market sentiment deteriorated due to uncertainties regarding a potential interim trade agreement between India and the US As the August 1 deadline approaches, discussions remain unresolved regarding tariffs on agricultural and dairy products.The Indian trade delegation's return from Washington without reaching an agreement suggests limited prospects for an immediate resolution. The situation is further complicated by the absence of official tariff communications from the US.Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) have seen consistently selling, with divestments of Rs 11,572 crore in Indian equities across the previous four trading sessions.""The near-term market construct has turned weak. Sustained FII selling and the correction in broader markets—especially smallcaps where valuations had turned excessive—will likely keep pressure on the indices,"" said Dr. VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services.Asian markets saw declines on Friday as profit-taking emerged before a significant week. Japan's Nikkei decreased 0.5% from its peak levels, whilst Hong Kong's Hang Seng and Australia's ASX 200 each reduced by 0.5%.

8th Pay Commission: What is the fitment factor; how it may impact salary hike of central government employees,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/8th-pay-commission-what-is-the-fitment-factor-how-it-may-impact-salary-hike-of-central-government-employees/articleshow/122888330.cms,"8th Pay Commission news:

What is the fitment factor?

Why it matters for take-home pay

When will the 8th Pay Commission be implemented?

As the central government has begun consultations with key stakeholders, including the Ministry of Defence, Ministry of Home Affairs, Department of Personnel and Training, and state governments, as part of the process to constitute the 8th Central Pay Commission (CPC) to revise pay structures for nearly 50 lakh central government employees and 62 lakh pensioners, attention is now focused on a key component of the salary calculation — the fitment factor.According to an ET report, the fitment factor plays a pivotal role in determining how much a government employee’s basic pay will rise under a new pay commission structure.The fitment factor is a numerical multiplier used to calculate revised salaries. It is applied to the existing basic pay to arrive at the new basic salary under the Pay Commission. A higher fitment factor results in a proportionally higher salary.For example, under the 7th Pay Commission, the fitment factor was 2.57 — meaning the basic pay was increased by 2.57 times to arrive at the new structure. If the 8th Pay Commission recommends a higher figure, the salary hike could range between 30% and 34%, as per initial estimates cited in reports. However there's no official word yet on the new multiplier, any upward revision will significantly impact take-home pay and pension calculations.A higher basic salary also boosts allowances that are linked to it, such as dearness allowance (DA), house rent allowance (HRA), and travel allowances. This means a higher fitment factor not only increases base pay but also enhances total take-home earnings.While there is no official notification yet, in a written reply to the Lok Sabha, Minister of State for Finance Pankaj Chaudhary said, “Inputs have been sought from major stakeholders, including Ministry of Defence, Ministry of Home Affairs, Department of Personnel & Training and from states.” He added that the chairperson and members of the 8th CPC will be appointed once the commission is formally notified.The Union Cabinet had approved the setting up of the 8th Pay Commission in January 2025, aiming to revise the pay structure of nearly 50 lakh central government employees and the allowances of about 65 lakh pensioners, according to a PTI report.Responding to a query on when the revised pay scales would be implemented, Chaudhary clarified: “The implementation would be taken up once the recommendations are made by the 8th CPC and are accepted by the government.”","The fitment factor is a numerical multiplier used to calculate revised salaries.

Gold price prediction today: Gold rates will be under pressure with a bearish outlook for the near term, say analysts.Gold futures on MCX (Contract: 05AUG2025) continue to trade under pressure after a short-lived recovery, with technical indicators signaling that upside potential remains capped.The price is currently hovering around ₹98,749 after a sharp two-day decline, with short-term moving averages indicating a bearish structure. As a result, today's outlook favors a Sell on Rise strategy in the ₹99,000 zone, with a stop-loss at ₹99,450.The 8-period EMA stands at ₹98,735, while the 21-period EMA is at ₹98,700. Prices are currently sandwiched between these averages, but the broader trend shows a sustained failure to break above either decisively. This crossover pattern reinforces a weak recovery structure and favors short positions at resistance zones.The price has been rejecting the middle band and is unable to approach the upper band convincingly. This behavior typically reflects low buying strength and enhances the probability of price rolling over near higher levels.The immediate pivot-based resistances lie between ₹98,950 and ₹99,200.A supply zone around ₹99,000 has been tested but not convincingly breached, confirming it as a sell-trigger level for intraday traders.RSI is currently at 51.98, having rebounded from sub-30 levels but struggling to sustain above 60. This mid-zone reading indicates a lack of bullish momentum and supports the view of limited upside.Although a minor crossover may have occurred during the bounce, the MACD histogram likely remains flat or mildly positive. There is no strong bullish divergence to suggest a trend reversal, implying rallies may remain corrective.Price continues to follow a lower-high lower-low structure on the intraday chart. The recent bounce appears more like a technical pullback rather than a change in trend. Selling near key resistance levels offers a favorable risk-reward setup.The short-term outlook for gold remains cautious, with bearish signals intact across major indicators. Intraday traders may look to Sell on Rise near ₹99,000, keeping a stop-loss at ₹99,450 and aiming for potential downside targets of ₹98,400 and ₹98,150. Weak momentum, resistance-heavy zones, and failed recovery above moving averages all point to the likelihood of further downside.","Gold futures on MCX (Contract: 05AUG2025) continue to trade under pressure after a short-lived recovery, with technical indicators signaling that upside potential remains capped.

Stock market recommendations:Benchmark indices remained rangebound, reflecting investor indecision amid heightened macro headwinds from ongoing India-US trade talks and the onset of the Q1 FY26 earnings season. Broader market activity was largely stock-specific, as participants adopted a cautious stance in anticipation of clearer fundamental cues and earnings visibility. Notably, India VIX slipped to 10—its lowest level in five months—signaling a lull in volatility and a market in wait-and-watch mode.Structurally, the index continues to exhibit strength through its formation of higher highs and higher lows, underscoring resilience despite geopolitical and policy-related uncertainties. On the near-term charts, the index breached its 20-day EMA, currently around 25,250—a level that previously acted as support and now serves as immediate resistance. A sustained move above 25,250 could open the door for further upside towards the 25,500 mark.On the downside, Nifty finds a robust support zone in the 24,900–25,100 range, backed by multiple technical confluences:(a) the rising 50-day EMA,(b) an ascending trendline connecting the May and June 2025 lows,(c) the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement of the prior rally from 24,473 to 25,669, and(d) the upper band of the recent breakout zone near the 25,000 level.Overall, the market remains in a consolidation phase with a cautiously optimistic undertone as the earnings season unfolds.Bank Nifty remained confined within a narrow consolidation zone last week, mirroring cautious investor sentiment amid ongoing India-US trade uncertainties and the impending Q1 FY26 earnings season for banking stocks.The index continues to hover above its 20-day EMA—a dynamic support level it has respected since April—underscoring the strength of the prevailing bullish undertone. This, coupled with improving market breadth, affirms the formation of a higher high–higher low structure, indicating a well-established uptrend.Over the past 10 sessions, the index has been consolidating within the 56,000–57,600 range, and we expect this sideways movement to persist. A breakout beyond either side of this band will be crucial to determine the next directional bias. On the downside, immediate support is placed at 55,940—aligning with the 50-day EMA—while stronger support lies at 55,500, a key demand zone that has consistently cushioned declines in recent weeks.The Gujarat Pipavav Port Ltd stock is forming a consistent pattern of higher highs and higher lows on the daily chart, signaling a sustained uptrend.Additionally, it continues to trade above its key moving averages, reinforcing the positive momentum.On the indicator front, the rising ADX, coupled with a strengthening +DMI, indicates that the ongoing trend is gaining momentum and is likely to strengthen further.The counter is on the verge of breaking out of its two-month consolidation range, supported by strong volumes, indicating a potential confirmation of the breakout.The stock has broken out of its consolidation phase on the daily timeframe, consistently forming a higher high–higher low structure over the past four months—signalling a sustained uptrend.It continues to trade well above its key moving averages, reinforcing the bullish bias.On the indicator front, a rising ADX along with a strengthening +DMI suggests increasing trend strength, indicating that momentum is likely to accelerate further.","According to Bajaj Broking Research, Gujarat Pipavav Port Ltd (GPPL) and National Aluminum are the top stock picks for today.

Sona Comstar: Sunjay Kapur's mother not co's shareholder

NEW DELHI: A succession battle has broken out in the family of the late Sunjay Kapur, the promoter of Sona Comstar who died last month following a heart attack during a polo match. Alleging that the death of her son in the UK was ""highly suspicious and (under) unexplained circumstances"", Sunjay's mother Rani sought deferment of the company's AGM scheduled for Thursday, which, among other matters, had been called to approve the appointment of Priya Sachdev Kapur (Sunjay's wife) as a non-executive director.The AGM, however, went ahead as scheduled and Priya's appointment was approved by the board after being reviewed by the nomination and remuneration committee.In a letter addressed to the company's board, Rani - without taking names - had alleged that some people had chosen the AGM as an opportune time to wrest control of the company and usurp the family legacy. She claimed that she had not given consent or officially nominated any person to be on the board of Sona BLW Precision Forgings (Sona Comstar).Rani also claimed that she was compelled to sign various papers while in a fragile emotional state following her son's death. ""The contents of such documents have never been revealed to me,"" she was quoted as saying in the letter, according to a news agency.In a statement after the AGM, the company - which is run by non-family professionals (as decided by Sunjay during his lifetime) - denied any wrongdoing, and said that Priya's appointment had been approved after her name was nominated by Aureus Investments Pvt Ltd, the promoter family entity for Sona Comstar in which the Kapur family held a significant stake.Sona Comstar claimed that Rani is not a shareholder of the company and denied asking her to sign any documents after Sunjay's death. ""Based on the legal counsel and the fact that Rani Kapur is not a shareholder of the company, the company concluded that it could not defer the AGM. For clarity, the company confirms that no documents have been signed or obtained from Rani Kapur following the passing of Sunjay Kapur,"" the statement said.It added that the AGM was conducted ""in full compliance with applicable laws"" and regulatory frameworks. ""Sona Comstar remains committed to the highest standards of corporate governance and transparency.""The company said that it had sought urgent legal advice from ""one of India's most reputed law firms"" in relation to the legality of proceeding with the AGM after Rani had requested a deferment.In her letter, Rani had stated that certain people were representing themselves as being ""the largest shareholders of the company since they claim to represent the interest of the family in the company"".She claimed that by virtue of a will executed by her late husband Surinder Kapur, she is the sole beneficiary of his estate and accordingly a major shareholder of Sona Group, including the auto component firm.",Sunjay Kapur died last month following a heart attack during a polo match.

NEW DELHI: Scotch and British gin makers may have been successful in gaining lower duty access to the Indian market, but domestic players are miffed and allege discrimination against Indian brands when they ship their products to the UK.""The UK and even the European Union do not allow fair imports of most Indian-Made Foreign Liquor (IMFL) products due to non-tariff barriers related to maturation and ingredients. We only wish that the Indian govt had stood firm on the issue of non-tariff barriers,"" said Anant S Iyer, director general of Confederation of Indian Alcoholic Beverage Companies (CIABC) told TOI here.Norms in the UK allow a product to be classified as whisky if it has been matured for at least three years, the same yardstick that the UK applies for brands produced and sold in their country.Iyer, however, described it as unfair, arguing that in cold weather it takes time to mature. ""In India, the maturation is much faster. A longer maturity period, say, three years, means that around one-third of our spirit will evaporate due to the hotter climate which will not only result in losses but also impact the quality of the product.""He said that the rules force Indian companies to classify their whisky as 'Indian spirits', effectively keeping them off bounds in the UK market.""We would like to label our products as Indian Whisky or Indian Rum/Brandy and sell the same in the UK/EU and allow the market and consumer to decide.""CIABC is petitioning that govt takes up ""the issue of discrimination"" with the UK govt to ensure that Indian brands, which fiercely compete with the western products here, are allowed the same opportunity abroad.The lobby group has also suggested a minimum import price (MIP) on Bottled-in-Origin (BIO) products coming in from Scotland to ensure that the Scotch whiskies are not imported to India at lower rates.","The UK and even the European Union do not allow fair imports of most Indian-Made Foreign Liquor (IMFL) products due to non-tariff barriers.

It paralysed Clorox's corporate network and crippled business operations. And to make matters worse, when Clorox called on Cognizant to provide incident response and disaster recovery support services, Cognizant botched its response and compounded the damage it already caused,"" Clorox said in its complaint.The complaint alleged that the cyberattack caused Clorox approximately $380 million in damages, including over $49 million in remedial costs alone to fix the damage caused by Cognizant's entirely preventable errors, and hundreds of millions of dollars in business interruption losses because the cyberattack impeded Clorox's ability to ship orders and keep its products on the shelves of retailers.Clorox entered into an agreement with Cognizant in 2013 that included service desk support and identity management. The complaint said that Cognizant operated the service desk for Clorox and provided IT support for Clorox employees, including employee credential recovery when needed.The cybercriminal called the Cognizant service desk a second time, again masquerading as Clorox employee 1, it said. On August 11, 2023, the cybercriminal initially contacted the service desk to request a reset of employee 1's password for Okta, an identity management tool Clorox used to verify network access.The agent replied by asking the cybercriminal to connect to Clorox's virtual private network (VPN). The cybercriminal then claimed he could not access the VPN without a password.

NEW DELHI: The India-UK Comprehensive Economic & Trade Agreement (CETA) provides Indian pharma companies access to the procurement programme of the National Health Scheme and other govt agencies, which are estimated to be to the tune of $122 billion.NHS in England alone buys medicines of $25 billion in addition to medical devices, which can now be tapped by Indian companies that would be treated on a par with their UK counterparts under govt procurement chapter of CETA.""The agreement opens govt procurement in both countries... The agreement is mutually beneficial for both the economies,"" commerce secretary Sunil Barthwal said at a press conference.India is eyeing major gains in pharmaceuticals sectors, where its exports are under $1 billion. Barthwal said that CETA will also help address regulatory concerns faster as mechanisms have been put in place and offer predictability for businesses in the long run.After the UAE, the UK pact is the second trade agreement that India signed with a chapter on govt procurement. The agreement, however, restricts the participation of British companies in tenders above Rs 5.5 crore and only to those issued by the Centre.India and the UK are looking to more than double bilateral trade to $112 billion by 2030 with both sides deciding to lower tariffs significantly. Currently, 48.2% of India's exports by value (47.3% of tariff lines) enter the UK at zero duty under the MFN regime. With the FTA, the coverage will be 99% of the goods and 100% of the value.On its part, India has opened 89.5% of its tariff lines, covering 91% of the UK's exports. But only 24.5% of the UK's export value will enjoy immediate duty-free market access with the rest of the cuts staggered over five to 10 years to provide adequate time for domestic industry to adjust.Barthwal said that the negotiations have kept in mind the future growth path of the economy and the tariff adjustments are nuanced.The India-UK free trade agreement, however, does not include a provision on Britain's proposed carbon tax, but if such a tax is imposed in the future, India will have the right to take steps to mitigate its impact on domestic exports, sources said on Friday.Govt on Friday said that it has stuck to India's stance on intellectual property rights, including the patent regime and the outcome in CETA represented a ""balanced and forward-looking approach"". ""It strengthens cooperation while preserving India's sovereign rights in matters of patent policy and access to essential medicines,"" it said.","The India-UK Comprehensive Economic & Trade Agreement (CETA) provides Indian pharma companies access to the procurement programme of the National Health Scheme and other govt agencies.

In two years it has doubled to more than 60 crore a day,"" Malhotra said, adding that the rising volumes make it essential to cover operational expenses. ""Costs will have to be paid, someone will have to bear the cost. It is an important infrastructure,"" he said, while speaking at an event organised by Financial Express.""Right now, it is govt which is defraying those costs. Going forward, how those costs are handled is very important. Whatever needs to be done, we will ensure that we have a good, robust, secure, accessible payment system working in our country.""He said govt's decision to subsidise UPI transactions had helped boost adoption. ""Govt has taken a view that it should be available free and govt is subsidising it. And I would say that it has borne good fruits,"" Malhotra said.The RBI governor's comments come amid industry demands to reinstate the merchant discount rate (MDR) on UPI payments - especially for high-value transactions or large merchants.The MDR was set to zero from Jan 1, 2020, to promote digital payments, but banks and fintechs argue that the zero-charge regime is no longer sustainable due to rising tech and infra costs.While payment players have lobbied for a modest MDR on bigger transactions, govt has repeatedly ruled out any direct levy on users or merchants, calling UPI a ""digital public good"". Instead, it has offered incentives to ecosystem players.Public sentiment has also been strongly against charges - surveys show that most users would reduce or entirely stop using UPI if transaction fees were introduced.",RBI governor Sanjay Malhotra flagged the need for a sustainable financial model to support the rapid growth of UPI and ensure long-term viability of the digital payments infrastructure.

What is the TCS Benching Policy ?

TCS Benching Policy: Industry Impact

Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) employees are worried about layoffs as the first round of the new benching policy at India’s largest IT services giant ends. Several TCS employees appear to be taking to social media platforms like Reddit to express their concerns about their role and future in TCS.The newly implemented benching guidelines effective from June 12 restrict the non-billable period to 35 days annually, beyond which employees could face professional setbacks or possible job loss.According to an ET report, employees have reported various challenges, including urgent project searches, assignments in mismatched skill areas, unsuccessful client interviews, and difficulties securing projects in preferred locations.A concerned Reddit participant was quoted as saying, ""This is the first step towards employment rationalisation based on utilisation. Brace for layoffs.""A new recruit shared, ""I have recently joined TCS and training was conducted in Java. Now, it's not even a month on bench and RMG is pressuring me to join a *** support project, far from Java and Python.""However, the financial daily could not verify the veracity of the posts on Redditt.Explaining the revised bench policy, TCS chief executive and managing director K Krithivasan told Times of India: ""It's always been expected that associates take responsibility for their careers. While HR supports project placement, we also expect associates to proactively seek new assignments after completing existing ones. What you're seeing now is simply a more structured version of what's long been in practice. We aim to minimise bench time.""Also Read | Infosys vs Cognizant fight gets uglier! Why are the two big IT firms battling it out in the US? Explained The company prioritises substantial investment in employee development. ""Once we've made that investment, we work to ensure associates are deployed,"" he said. ""While preferences are considered, projects are driven by client needs, not personal choice. We deploy based on training, demand, and skill alignment. If gaps exist, we work to close them before deployment.""When questioned about TCS withholding salaries for staff on extended bench periods, Krithivasan offered no direct response.The exact impact on the TCS workforce remains uncertain. Based on industry data, approximately 15-18% of employees at major Indian IT companies typically remain on bench. TCS, which leads India's IT sector, currently employs around 613,000 individuals.Last week a workers' rights organisation approached Union labour minister Mansukh Mandaviya, requesting immediate intervention regarding TCS's bench policy, which they described as ""inhumane,"" ""exploitative"" and mentally taxing for technology professionals.Nascent Information Technology Employees Senate (NITES) submitted a formal complaint to the minister, claiming that TCS is pressuring benched employees through termination threats and withholding experience certificates if they cannot secure project assignments within specified timeframes.Also Read | TCS gives out variable pay! Over 70% employees to get 100% variable; no decision yet on salary hikes ""These are not non-performing employees, but skilled professionals who find themselves temporarily without allocation… Instead of support, they are met with suspicion, coercion, and threats,"" NITES president Harpreet Singh Saluja said in the letter.Some staff members are however backing TCS' decision, noting that numerous employees have stayed unassigned for extended periods, turning down offered projects. These individuals have used their unallocated time for pursuing additional qualifications whilst not contributing to the organisation's productivity.""This may help TCS trimming some seriously underperforming resources, those stuck on TCS like a leech,"" a Reddit user posted.The IT sector anticipates significant changes as artificial intelligence (AI) begins to automate routine operations.""We expect IT companies to become stricter with their bench policies due to the soft business environment and AI-led demand for advanced skill sets,"" Pareekh Jain, founder and CEO of EIIRTrend told ET. He observed that staff expenses are notably affecting company profit margins.The stringent bench policy implemented by TCS might influence other IT firms, as managing bench strength becomes increasingly challenging due to AI-driven productivity improvements making it harder to reassign entry-level engineers, according to industry specialists.""Tech companies must continuously align their employees' skill sets with evolving client needs. By revisiting their bench policies, organisations are encouraging employees to reskill and stay relevant in high-demand areas such as AI, cybersecurity, and digital engineering,"" said Nitin Bhatt, technology sector leader at EY India according to the financial daily’s report.""Going forward, tenure and grade-based promotions and merit increases will likely be replaced by assessments of skills proficiency and competencies required to take on new roles,"" he added.Also Read | ‘Character assassination’: Delhi HC asks Wipro to pay Rs 2 lakh for defamation of ex-employee; termination letter full of ‘stigma and insinuations’","Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) employees are worried about layoffs as the first round of the new benching policy at India’s largest IT services giant ends.

US-EU trade deal talks: Donald Trump sees ‘50/50 chance’ as August 1 tariff deadline nears; EU readies $109 bn retaliation plan if talks fail,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-eu-trade-deal-talks-donald-trump-sees-50/50-chance-as-august-1-tariff-deadline-nears-eu-readies-109-bn-retaliation-plan-if-talks-fail/articleshow/122909654.cms,"US President Donald Trump on Friday said there was a “50/50 chance” of securing a trade agreement with the European Union to lower import tariffs, as the deadline for new US duties looms large.“I would say that we have a 50/50 chance, maybe less than that, but a 50/50 chance of making a deal with the EU,” Trump told reporters before departing the White House for a trip to Scotland, quoted AFP.The Trump administration has set an August 1 deadline for dozens of countries to finalise trade pacts or face steep tariff hikes. In April, the US had announced a temporary pause on the imposition of higher duties under its “90 deals in 90 days” initiative. So far, only five agreements have been reached — including with the UK, Japan and the Philippines.While EU member states have tasked the European Commission with leading negotiations, Trump has threatened to impose 30% tariffs on EU exports if no deal is signed by the end of the month.According to multiple diplomats cited by AFP, the US and EU are moving closer to a compromise that includes a 15% baseline tariff on European goods, with possible carve-outs for key sectors.However, EU states on Thursday approved a retaliatory package worth $109 billion (93 billion euros), set to come into effect on August 7 if the negotiations fall short.Trump said that “most” of the deals he is pursuing are “done” — though he clarified that he was referring to letters notifying countries about the imposition of tariffs, not fully negotiated free trade agreements.“I don’t want to hurt countries, but we’re going to send a letter out sometime during the week, and it’s basically going to say, ‘You’re going to pay 10 percent, you’re going to pay 15 percent, you’re going to pay maybe less,’ I don’t know,” Trump said.The president also acknowledged that tariffs on other countries are typically borne by US importers and consumers.On other trade fronts, Trump said negotiations with Canada have stalled and reiterated the possibility of a 35% tariff on Canadian exports. He described the talks as not having had “a lot of luck.”On China, Trump suggested progress, saying the two countries are within the “confines of a deal.” China is the US’s third-largest trading partner in goods this year.","US President Donald Trump says there is a ""50/50 chance"" of a trade deal with the EU.

The firm has struggled to keep pace with rivals like Nvidia and AMD amid surging demand for AI chips.By contrast, Deckers Brands, owner of Ugg and Hoka, soared over 13% as it beat Wall Street expectations with a 17% rise in Q1 revenue to $965 million.

Just exhuasted, but it was well worth it. The next step is to close the deal early by Aug 7.”The FCC’s decision, passed by a 2-1 vote, came just weeks after Paramount paid $16 million to settle a lawsuit filed by Donald Trump over a 2020 “60 Minutes” interview with then-vice president Kamala Harris, which the president claimed was deceptively edited to sway the 2024 election. While CBS denied the allegation, it chose to settle to avoid any delays to the merger.Crucial to gaining FCC approval were assurances from Ellison, son of Oracle founder Larry Ellison, and RedBird Capital that the new management would ensure unbiased journalism at CBS. The company has promised to appoint an independent ombudsman to oversee complaints related to editorial fairness and transparency, the New York Post reported.In a move seen as politically charged, Paramount also scrapped its diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives to align with the Trump administration’s stance, which argues such policies amount to discrimination.“Americans no longer trust the legacy national news media to report fully, accurately, and fairly,” said FCC Chair Brendan Carr, a Trump appointee.""It is time for a change. That is why I welcome Skydance’s commitment to make significant changes at the once storied CBS broadcast network.""Dissenting FCC Commissioner Anna Gomez, the sole Democratic vote against the deal, condemned the decision, saying, “After months of cowardly capitulation to this administration, Paramount finally got what it wanted.”As part of the deal, Shari Redstone, the controlling shareholder of Paramount Global, will receive $1.75 billion in cash and step down from the company’s board. Her departure marks the end of the Redstone family’s direct influence over the media empire her father, Sumner Redstone, built.Skydance, known for producing hits like Top Gun: Maverick and Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning, will merge with Paramount to form “Paramount Skydance Corp.” The newly formed company will remain publicly traded but under the control of the Ellison family. David Ellison will serve as chairman and CEO, while former NBCUniversal boss Jeff Shell will become president.The FCC also approved the transfer of 28 CBS-owned TV station licences to the new company. This came shortly after CBS abruptly cancelled The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, citing financial reasons. The programme, despite strong ratings, was reportedly losing $40 million a year.Trump, who originally sued Paramount for $20 billion, claimed this week that the real settlement was closer to $36 million. The new owners committed $20 million to run pro-MAGA public service ads.The merger marks a dramatic turning point for Paramount, which has struggled in recent years with declining revenues and the challenges of streaming-era disruption. Redstone had initially reunited CBS and Viacom in 2019 in a bid to strengthen the company’s competitive footing, but the rapidly changing media landscape proved difficult to navigate.With the deal now approved, all eyes will be on Ellison and Skydance as they take the reins of one of America’s most iconic media brands.","The US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has officially approved the $8.4 billion merger between Paramount Global and Skydance Media.

US-Japan deal brings tariff clarity: 15% cap averts August duties; EU and China face pressure as next deadlines loom,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-japan-deal-brings-tariff-clarity-15-cap-averts-august-duties-eu-and-china-face-pressure-as-next-deadlines-loom/articleshow/122887950.cms,"Markets cheer clarity, automakers lead gains

EU and China next in line

A landmark trade deal between the US and Japan has set a new benchmark for global tariff negotiations, as economists say the 15% cap agreed for auto and goods tariffs could become the new normal in ongoing trade talks with other key US partners.Under the agreement, tariffs on Japanese auto imports to the US will drop from 27.5% to 15%, while levies on other goods that were set to rise to 25% from August 1 will also be cut to 15%, Reuters reported. The deal, which includes investment and lending commitments, is one of the most significant trade pacts signed by US President Donald Trump, who has imposed a series of steep tariffs on dozens of trading partners this yearThe deal relieves markets and raises pressure on other major economies, including the European Union and China, both of which face looming August deadlines to conclude similar agreements or risk the reimposition of punitive tariffs.“Average tariffs for the US were around 2.5% for 2024; currently, they stand around 17%,” said Mohit Kumar of Jefferies, referencing the spike in duties following Trump’s “Liberation Day” trade policy shift in April.“Our base case remains that when the dust settles, we could see average tariffs around 15%, though recent deals suggest that this number could be slightly higher,” Kumar was quoted as saying by Reuters.“While a negative from a macro point of view, the world can live with 15% or so tariffs.”Relieved by the clarity brought by the US-Japan pact, Japan’s Nikkei 225 index rose 3.5%, while European automakers with major US exposure also rallied. Volvo Car surged over 10%, while Porsche, BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen gained between 4% and 7%.“It looks like the benchmark for major economies is going to be 10–15%, and a somewhat higher level for smaller economies,” said Derek Halpenny, head of research at MUFG in London.Deutsche Bank’s Jim Reid noted the move “helped to ease investor fears that tariffs are about to snap back higher on August 1,” but cautioned that significant threats remain. “The threat of much higher tariffs still remains for several large economies, including the 30% on the EU, 35% on Canada and 50% on Brazil,” he said, quoted Reuters.The European Union, which negotiates on behalf of its 27 member states, faces the threat of 30% US tariffs by August 1.

Donald Trump’s Aggressive Trade Strategy

Amidst ongoing trade deal announcements, US President Donald Trump seems to have indicated that the 15% reciprocal tariff rate would be the new baseline for most countries.""We'll have a straight, simple tariff of anywhere between 15% and 50%,"" Trump said Wednesday at an AI summit in Washington according to a Bloomberg report.

Meanwhile, other countries, including South Korea, India, and EU member states, continue their efforts to reach an accord before the increased tariffs become effective.On Wednesday, Trump indicated his intention to implement a straightforward tariff system for certain nations, citing the impracticality of negotiating individual agreements with numerous countries. He noted that discussions with the European Union were progressing seriously.""If they agree to open up the union to American businesses, then we will let them pay a lower tariff,"" Trump said.On Sunday, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick informed CBS News that smaller nations, including ""the Latin American countries, the Caribbean countries, many countries in Africa"" would face a baseline tariff of 10%.

'No More Indian Workers, Or China Factories': Trump's Blunt Warning To US Tech Giants Like Apple

Why Did Trump Not ‘Break Up’ Nvidia?

Did you know that US President Donald Trump wanted to ‘break up’ Nvidia, the global artificial intelligence leader and the world’s most valuable firm? Trump has said that his aim was to introduce more competition in the AI sector, but he was advised against touching Nvidia.According to a Bloomberg report, Trump revealed that he had contemplated dividing Nvidia Corp. to enhance competition in the AI chip sector, but later discovered the complexity of such an action.Recently, Nvidia hit a historic milestone this month by becoming the first company in the world to have over $4 trillion in market value - that’s more than the GDP of several major economies!Nvidia has benefited substantially from the increased demand for AI computing equipment required for large language models.""I said, 'Look, we'll break this guy up,' before I learned the facts here,"" Trump said on Wednesday at an AI conference in Washington. His advisers informed him about the significant challenges involved and explained that Nvidia's market dominance would require years for competitors to match.""I figured we could go in and we could sort of break them up a little bit, get them a little competition, and I found out it's not easy in that business,"" Trump continued.Also Read | Forget Nvidia’s $4 trillion valuation!

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Startups will play important role in helping India become 3rd largest economy: CEA Nageswaran,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/startups-will-play-important-role-in-helping-india-become-3rd-largest-economy-cea-nageswaran/articleshow/105332523.cms,"Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor ( CEA ) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran Udaan until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.Udaan built an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business still accounts for a very small part of India’s overall retail market but can balloon to $150 billion in sales and yield a 100% return on capital invested in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co. estimates published in the Mint newspaper.Bengaluru-based Udaan has also ventured into financing through its fintech unit which helps shopkeepers get working capital loans to buy inventory. That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says.

SAR imagery provides much higher resolution than other forms of remote sensing technology such as hyperspectral and multispectral. SAR is a critical technology for strategic reconnaissance and planning as well as for disaster management.According to Misra, winning the challenge in just over a year of floating the company is a major booster.He said L and P band SAR have an advantage over other frequencies (like X band) when it comes to penetration capabilities through rain, clouds, foliage and vegetation in a tropical country like India, and underground penetration capabilities in dry terrain.Continuing further, he said the L band SAR will provide 1 metre resolution, spotlight resolution in Stripmap mode. The current industry standard is 5-10 metre in L band. Misra said both the L and P band will operate simultaneously from a satellite borne SAR. Recently, Sisir Radar successfully developed and tested the world’s highest resolution L-Band SAR fitted on a drone. With 0.2 metre resolution, this is by far the highest L band SAR in the world, he said.","Space sector startup, Sisir Radar Private Ltd has hit success at the prestigious iDEX DefSpace Challenge.

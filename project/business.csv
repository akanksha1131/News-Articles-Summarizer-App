Silver prices soared to a record high on the Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX) on Friday as the December 2025 futures contract climbed to Rs 1,70,415 per kilogram. This marks an increase of Rs 1,977 or 1.18% for the day.The surge in silver prices has resulted in a remarkable 19.8% gain for the month of October, rising from a closing price of Rs 1,42,145 on September 30. This significant monthly increase highlights strong festive demand and growing industrial interest in the metal.The recent rally has sparked renewed interest in silver's long-term potential, with analysts attributing the uptrend to solid underlying fundamentals. Mahendra Patil, Founder and Managing Partner at MP Financial Advisory Services LLP (MPFASL), noted that silver is experiencing ""a phase of structural endurance rather than speculative exuberance"", as quoted by Economic Times.Patil pointed out that while silver has historically been volatile, its past performance offers valuable insights. The metal previously approached the $50 per ounce mark in 1980 and 2011, and with 2025 marking its third such approach, the focus is now on whether it can maintain sustained momentum.In 2025, silver prices surged from $29 to over $47 per ounce, reaching ""its highest level in more than a decade."" MPFASL attributes this momentum to several factors, including ""higher expectations from US rate cuts, sustained central-bank buying, and industrial restocking across solar and electronics supply chains.""Highlighting silver's dual appeal, Patil said, ""Silver is gaining ground as both a symbolic and practical substitute. Beyond its decorative appeal, the industrial demand linked to solar panels, electronics, and electric mobility provides fundamental support to prices, creating a dual-use demand base that gold lacks.""The rise in silver demand is not limited to global markets. In India, silver imports have increased significantly. ""Silver imports have expanded, reflecting its growing relevance as an industrial and investment metal within the renewable-energy and electronics value chains,"" MPFASL reported.Data from the firm also revealed that silver delivered an annualized return of 32.92% in the CY2023–CY2025 period, with a volatility of 24.66%, based on historical performance. The correlation between gold and silver during this period stood at 0.95, indicating closely linked price movements, although silver's trajectory has increasingly been driven by industrial factors.Looking ahead, MPFASL suggests that silver may continue to benefit from its industrial underpinnings. ""Silver exceeded expectations, crossing $47 per ounce on renewed industrial restocking in solar and electronics,"" the report noted.Most projections indicate that silver is expected to remain in the $44–50 per ounce range through FY2026. While gold may experience consolidation, ""silver amplified the momentum as the cyclical bellwether of a broader industrial revival.""As India enters the festive season and global industrial restocking continues, the metal's trajectory will likely depend on sustained demand from the electronics and renewable sectors. MPFASL adds that silver's ability to surpass the $50 per ounce mark may depend on whether it can ""finally build sustained momentum and move toward the next big landmark, its metaphorical 'century.'""For domestic traders, Rs 1,70,415 now serves as a key resistance level on MCX. With industrial and festive tailwinds in play, attention will remain on whether silver can build upon this rally or consolidate near its current highs.","Silver prices soared to a record high on the Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX) on Friday. The December 2025 futures contract climbed to Rs 1,70,415 per kilogram. The surge in silver prices has resulted in a remarkable 19.8% gain for the month of October.

As Diwali celebrations continue across the country, many people are wondering whether banks are open or closed today, on October 22.The festival of lights is not limited to a single day, it stretches over nearly five days in several states, with each day marking a unique cultural and religious significance.This year, the festive week has brought a series of bank holidays across different states for Diwali and its associated observances, including Naraka Chaturdashi, Laxmi Puja, Govardhan Puja, and Bhai Dooj.Banks in several states are closed today, on the occasion of Diwali (Bali Pratipada), Vikram Samvant New Year Day,Govardhan Pooja/Balipadyami, Laxmi Puja (Deepawali).Bali Pratipada or Bali Padva, is celebrated on the fourth day of Diwali festivities. The day marks the symbolic return of the demon king Bali to Earth. In Gujarat, Maharashtra, and Karnataka, it is observed as the traditional New Year according to the Vikram Samvat calendar.GujaratMaharashtraKarnatakaUttarakhandSikkimRajasthanUttar PradeshBanks in Gujarat, Sikkim, Manipur, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, and Himachal Pradesh will remain closed in observance of Bhai Dooj, Chitragupt Jayanti, Laxmi Puja Bhratridwitiya, and Ningol Chakkouba.Banks in West Bengal, Bihar, and Jharkhand will be shut for Chhath Puja (Evening Puja).Bihar and Jharkhand will again observe a holiday for Chhath Puja (Morning Puja).Gujarat will mark a bank holiday to commemorate Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel’s birth anniversary.Nevertheless, holidays do not mean that customers can not process their transactions or withdraw cash as they can continue to access most services through online banking, ATMs, mobile apps, and UPI for tasks such as fund transfers, bill payments, and balance checks.However, in-person services like large cash deposits, cheque clearances, or demand drafts will remain unavailable during the holidays.Account holders are advised to plan their transactions in advance to avoid any inconvenience during the festive period and to make full use of digital banking options for smooth and hassle-free access to essential services.","Banks in several states are closed today, on the occasion of Diwali (Bali Pratipada), Vikram Samvant New Year Day,Govardhan Pooja/Balipadyami, Laxmi Puja (Deepawali) In Gujarat, Sikkim, Manipur, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, and Himachal Pradesh, banks will remain closed.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124732128,imgsize-1357919,width-400,resizemode-4/this-is-an-ai-generated-image-used-only-for-representative-purpose.jpg"

The dilemma on festival dates

Muhurat Trading 2025: A blend of tradition and finance



Remaining stock market holidays for the year





As Diwali approaches, many are uncertain whether the festival falls on October 20 or 21 this year. As for stock markets, investors would also like to know definitive dates of the days when trading will not happen. They have a definitive date to note: the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) and National Stock Exchange (NSE) will be closed on Tuesday, October 21, for Diwali Lakshmi Puja, and again on Wednesday, October 22, for Balipratipada.However, on October 21, a special trading activity will occur which is the traditional Muhurat Trading session, a symbolic ritual lasting one hour, from 1:45 PM to 2:45 PM. This session will allow trading across various segments, including equities, futures and options, currency and commodity derivatives, and securities lending and borrowing (SLB), with modifications permitted until 2:55 PM.The confusion arises because the lunar calendar's Amavasya tithi, or new moon phase, technically extends into October 21. However, the auspicious time for Lakshmi Puja is on the evening of October 20, leading most households to celebrate then. The following day marks the start of the new Hindu Samvat year, celebrated with the Muhurat Trading session on Dalal Street.This year, the Muhurat session will occur in the afternoon on October 21, a departure from recent years when it was held in the evening.Additionally, markets are closed on October 18 for Dhanteras and October 19 for the regular weekend schedule.Muhurat Trading, meaning ""auspicious hour,"" is more than just a market event. It symbolizes the beginning of Samvat 2082, the new Hindu financial year. For investors, it represents optimism and a prayer for prosperity rather than a focus on profits.This tradition has persisted for decades, often bringing positive returns. The Sensex has closed higher in 14 of the past 18 Muhurat sessions. Even during the 2008 global financial crisis, the index rose by 5.86% during the session. In 2024, it gained 335 points, or 0.42%, continuing the trend of festive cheer.Analysts, as quoted by ET, point out that trading volumes are typically low during this one-hour window, leading to potential volatility. However, the session is not seen as a typical trading day but rather a symbolic reset, where traders, families, and brokers come together to mark a hopeful start to the new year.After October 22, only two more holidays remain for stock markets part from the regular Saturdays and Sundays. Markets will be shut on November 5 for Prakash Gurpurb Sri Guru Nanak Dev and December 25 for Christmas"," Bombay Stock Exchange and National Stock Exchange will be closed on Tuesday, October 21, for Diwali Lakshmi Puja, and again on Wednesday, October 22, for Balipratipada.

Gold price prediction: Where are gold prices headed in the near term? Why investors should not chase the rally,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gold-price-prediction-today-where-are-gold-rates-headed-on-october-21-2025-and-in-the-near-term-diwali/articleshow/124714972.cms,"Gold may see some correction ahead of the US CPI and PMI reports to be released on October 24 as hot inflation data may hurt December cut chances. (AI image)

Gold Performance:

On October 20, spot gold, despite easing US-China trade tensions and subsiding bad loan concerns involving US regional banks, quickly reversed its nearly 0.75% decline to $4219 in the Asian session to rise sharply to $4355 in the US session. Bad loan concerns eased as the US regional banks posted encouraging results.

Although on October 20, Trump threatened China with 155% tariff rate if no deal by November 1, gold had already rallied to its session’s high by then.

At the time of writing this article, spot gold was trading with a gain of 2.11% at $4345. The MCX December gold contract was changing hands at 103,443, up 2.70% for the day.

Earlier, the yellow metal extended its weekly winning streak to the ninth consecutive week as it closed with a weekly gain of nearly 5.75% at $4251 in the week ending October 17.

Silver Shines Brighter Than Gold This Dhanteras Amid High Prices

Data roundup:

Chinese data on October 20 were largely encouraging as Q3 GDP at 4.8% annualized rate came in line with the forecast, while industrial production at 2.9% and retail sales data at 6.5% topped their respective forecasts of 3% and 5%.

US-China talks:

US Treasury Secretary Bessent and Vice Premier He Lifeng will have the next round of trade talks next week in Malaysia, which will prepare ground for presidential meetings.

US President is set to meet with Chinese President Xi in South Korea in a couple of weeks. Trump has listed rare earths, fentanyl and soybeans as top US issues with China. He wants China to resume soybean purchases

Dollar Index and yields:

At the time of writing this article, the US Dollar Index was noted at 98.52, up nearly 0.10% for the day.

Ten-year US yields were hovering around 2.99%, while two-year yields at 3.46% were up by nearly one-bps.

Gold ETF holdings and COMEX stocks:

As of October 17, total known global gold ETF holdings stood at 98.23 MOz, a new cycle high, as holdings rose for the seventh straight week.

Gold ETF holdings have recorded a net inflow of 15.38 MOz YTD, which amounts to a net inflow of 478 tons this year so far.

Of late, huge ETF inflow has played a crucial role in pushing up gold prices.

COMEX gold stocks stand at 39.10 MOz, a decline of 13.26% from the record inventory level of 45.07 MOz noted in April.

China's fourth plenum:

The Chinese Communist Party is holding the fourth plenary session of its 20th central committee in a four-day closed-door meeting from October 20 to 23. A proposal of the CCP Central Committee on formulating the 15th five-year plan for National and Social Development will be discussed at the plenum and if approved, it will be approved at the 'Two Sessions' - China's annual parliamentary and political consultative meetings - in March 2026.

Upcoming data:

Major US data on deck this week include Philadelphia Fed non-manufacturing activity (October 21), weekly job data (October 23), existing home sales (October 23), CPI (October 24), S&P global US PMIs (October 24), University of Michigan sentiment and inflation expectations (October 24). Some of the data may get delayed due to the ongoing partial shutdown of the US government.

Eurozone's PMIs will be out on October 24.

Focus will be mainly on the US CPI data as traders try to assess the Fed’s monetary policy trajectory. Hot inflation data will affect rate cut chances.

Gold Price Outlook:

Given the fact that both equities and gold have been rallying mostly together, the current gold rally is driven mostly by ETF inflows and late buyers as traders focus on the FOMC monetary policy decision due on October 29 wherein the Fed is expected to cut rates by 25 bps. It is to be noted that both markets and the Fed expect two more rate cuts by the year-end with the next rate cut to take place in December.

US-China tensions may also be driving the rally as China has yet to make its stand clear, though risk assets remain well bid.

Trump’s China threats on Monday did not dent the risk sentiments.

Gold may see some correction ahead of the US CPI and PMI reports to be released on October 24 as hot inflation data may hurt December cut chances as October rate cut is almost a done deal.

In the near-term, gold is expected to be highly volatile due to US-China headlines.

Buying the dips is preferred over chasing the rally at this point, though the metal may quickly surge to $4500 in case US-China tensions escalate.

Support is at $4200/$4116/$4000. Resistance is at $4400/$4500.

We look for a target of $5000 in a year’s timeframe.

Silver: Buy the dips



Performance:

At the time of writing this article, spot silver was trading with a gain of 0.50% at $52.17.

Spot silver closed with a weekly gain of 3.42% at 51.92 in the week ending October 17 as it extended its weekly winning streak to the ninth straight week, which mirrors the gold’s streak.

Silver, supported by an extremely tight market due to ETF led demand, has rallied over 40% since August 1 as it hit a fresh record high of $54.47 on October 17.

Global Silver ETF holdings:

Silver ETF holdings stand at 823.23 MOz as holdings slid from cycle high of 833.41 MOz as noted on October 14.

Total known silver ETF holdings have risen 15.26% YTD as ETF inflows this year amount to a net inflow of 3,390 tons of silver.

Silver is now the largest cost component in a solar module production

After steep price increase, silver is now the largest cost component in solar module production as it overtook aluminum and PV glass. As per Bloomberg calculation, current silver price translates to over 17% of the per-watt price of solar modules.

Silver Price Outlook:

Silver may see profit booking ahead of the US CPI and PMI reports. However, overall, outlook remains constructive.

Considering the steep rise in silver prices since August 1, it is advisable to buy the dips rather than chase the rally.

Support is at $50.62/$50/$46. Resistance is at $55/$56.10.

If risk appetite remains reasonably healthy, silver may rise to $56/$58 level by the year-end.

We expect the metal to reach $75-$100 in next three to five years as we look for a target of $60-$65 in a year’s timeframe.

NEW DELHI: India’s domestic car industry may be counting on govt’s GST cuts to manage a growth in volumes, but exports are turning out to be quite a happy hunting ground for the passenger vehicles industry which has registered a near 20% jump in the first half of this fiscal, shipping a variety of vehicles ranging from electrics, hatchbacks, to sedans and SUVs.Exports in FY26’s Apr-Sep period have hitting almost 4.5 lakh units, led by strong volumes by Maruti Suzuki , Hyundai, Nissan and Volkswagen.Maruti Suzuki, leader in domestic sales, is also ahead in exports and is targeting to ship over 4 lakh units in fiscal 2025-26. The going is already strong for Maruti with its overseas shipments – comprising models such as Fronx, Jimny, Swift, Baleno and Dzire – crossing two lakh units in the first half.“We are exporting cars in a quarter what we used to export in a year, just 4 years ago. This is a salute to the call of Make in India, Make for the World,” Rahul Bharti, Senior Executive Officer (Corporate Affairs) at Maruti, told TOI.Such has been the refinement and quality in manufacturing that Maruti is now exporting cars to its parent’s home market Japan where the India-made Jimny is a hit. Also, it started sales of its first electric car, the eVitara, in export markets while planning to get it to India later.“In August and September we shipped over 6,000 electric vehicles,” Bharti said.Hyundai, which was perhaps the first company to bet heavily on exports, has had a 17% growth in exports this year as it shipped nearly 1 lakh units against 84,900 units in the first half of the previous fiscal.José Muñoz, the global CEO of Hyundai, lauded the quality and cost competitiveness of manufacturing here. He said the company will make India a key global hub for export of electrics, apart from ICE (internal combustion engine) products.The company exports the Creta to Africa, Grandi10 (both hatchback & sedan) and Verna to Africa, Middle East and Latin America, i20 to Africa and Latin America. Cumulatively, it has exported to more than 150 countries. “By 2030, India will be our second-largest region globally, aligned with PM Narendra Modi's vision of ‘Make in India’. We're making India a global export hub, targeting up to 30% export contribution,” Muñoz said.Nissan has been exporting the Sunny sedan to the Middle East, and Magnite compact SUV to as many as 65 countries. Company MD Saurabh Vatsa said India is Nissan’s second-largest export hub in the AMIEO region (Africa, Middle-East, India, Europe & Oceania).“India is home to one of the finest engineering talent, an extremely efficient and competitive manufacturing and high quality vendor and supplier base. Moreover, India’s well-equipped and easily accessible ports provide a geographical advantage on international shipping routes to multiple destinations,” Vatsa said.","Exports in FY26’s Apr-Sep period have hitting almost 4.5 lakh units.

US President Donald Trump claimed on Tuesday again that India was not going to buy ""much oil from Russia.""

He's not going to buy much oil from Russia. He wants to see that war end as much as I do. He wants to see the war between Russia and Ukraine to end. They're not going to be buying too much oil.

Our import policies are guided entirely by this objective.""Addressing the China tariff situation, Trump said, ""Right now, as of November 1st, China will have about 155% tariffs put on it.

NEW DELHI: Growth in the key core sector slowed to a three-month low in Sept, dragged down by a contraction in output in four of the eight segments. Data released by the commerce and industry ministry on Tuesday showed the eight core sectors — coal, crude oil, natural gas, refinery products, fertilisers, steel, cement and electricity rose an annual 3% in Sept, slower than the 6.5% in Aug but a tad higher than 2.4% in Sept last year. Growth in April-Sept was at 2.9%, slower than the 4.3% recorded in the same period last year, the data showed.The core sector accounts for nearly 40.3% of the index of industrial production (IIP), and the performance of the sector has a bearing on IIP numbers, which will be released later this month. The energy segment among the eight sectors contracted, with coal declining 1.2%, crude oil 1.3%, natural gas 3.8%, and refinery products dipping by 3.7%.The steel sector grew at double-digit rates for third consecutive month. The sector grew by 14.1% in Sept, higher than 13.6% in Aug and above 1.8% in Sept last year. It recorded a growth of 16.6% in July as construction activity gathered pace.

MUMBAI: As the Dalal Street tradition goes, Indian investors only buy stocks during the Muhurat session on Diwali day. As a result, leading indices typically close with gains in the special trading session, even if it’s marginal.Tuesday’s hour-long Muhurat session that marked the start of Samvat year 2082, was no different. After opening a little over 100 points higher, the se nse x rallied about 300 points but closed with a marginal gain of 63 points at 84,426 points. On the NSE, Nifty closed 25 points up at 25,869 points. This was the eighth successive year that these two leading indices closed higher. The last time the indices had closed lower during the Muhurat session was in 2017.This year in a departure from tradition, the Muhurat trading session was conducted in the afternoon between 1.45pm and 2.45pm instead of in the evening of Diwali day. This change of timing was necessitated to adhere to the panchang, the Hindu almanac that, among others, sets time for auspicious occasions.During Tuesday’s session, brokers with their families visited the bourses. NSE MD Ashishkumar Chauhan and BSE MD Sundararaman Ramamurthy did Lakshmi Puja at their respective exchanges and then rang the ceremonial bell to mark the start of the special trading session.“Muhurat trading is a time to reflect on the values that shape our financial journey, including trust, knowledge, and discipline,” the NSE MD said. “Investing is not only about creating wealth but about participating in India’s remarkable economic growth story.”Chauhan also stressed the need to have a well-informed investor community. “As more people enter the capital markets, investor awareness and informed decision-making become essential for building confidence and sustaining long-term prosperity,” he said.During Tuesday’s session, foreign funds were net buyers at Rs 97 crore, while domestic funds were net sellers at Rs 607 crore, BSE data showed. At the close of the session, investors were richer by a little over Rs 1.2 lakh crore with BSE’s market cap at Rs 470.9 lakh crore.","Tuesday’s hour-long Muhurat session that marked the start of Samvat year 2082, was no different. After opening a little over 100 points higher, the se nse x rallied about 300 points but closed with a marginal gain of 63 points at 84,426 points. On the NSE, Nifty closed 25 points up at 25,869 points.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124731405,imgsize-1646544,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

MUMBAI: Tracking slides in global prices of gold and silver, two precious metals witnessed correction in domestic market during Tuesday’s Muhurat trading session on MCX. A similar trend was observed in the spot market, although trading was thin on Diwali day, market players said.Global investors are looking for a ‘risk-on’ rally, meaning investors are again more willing to buy risky assets like stocks.

India’s aircraft component sector takes flight,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/indias-aircraft-component-sector-takes-flight/articleshow/124731311.cms,"Representative image





MUMBAI: Global aerospace giants are boosting their sourcing from India, accelerating growth in the country’s emerging aircraft component sector. Local companies are expanding capacities, moving beyond basic manufacturing to higher-value work, and scouting for acquisitions, with revenue numbers soaring due to robust orders.The sector is also gearing up to launch about Rs 5,700 crore of IPOs in the next few months, given the buoyant equity market and growing investor appetite for high-growth potential companies. It is also one of the few sectors that has been less affected by US import tariffs compared to other industries like textiles, gems, and auto parts, where duties are double (50%) than those on aerocomponents (25%).“We build the business and invest for the long term. Tariffs are something we don’t have control over as a company. The key thing is we are a critical part of our customer supply chain, and it is not something they can source elsewhere overnight. It takes years of planning for them to make any changes. We are critical enough for customers that paying tariffs is not a material issue. Our US customers, when they export products, get credit back on the duty,” said Aequs chairman & CEO Aravind Melligeri.The Belgaum-based company, which counts Airbus, Boeing, Bombardier, Collins Aerospace, and Spirit Aerosystems as customers, earned 89% of its Rs 925 crore revenue in FY25 from aerocomponents.The numbers tell the growth story. The US-based Boeing sources components and critical systems of over $1 billion annually from India as compared to $250 million a decade ago. Likewise, France’s Airbus plans to increase its procurement to $2 billion from India by 2030.Azad Engineering, a Hyderabad-based supplier to Honeywell Aerospace, Rolls Royce, and Eaton Aerospace, saw an 84% jump in its aerospace and defence business revenue to Rs 81 crore in FY25, with a 215% jump in stock price since listing in Dec 2023.“Earning the trust of an OEM — especially for life-critical and highly engineered components — requires years of consistent performance, precision, and reliability, not just by simply acquiring technology,” said Azad Engineering chairman & CEO Rakesh Chopdar. “Having demonstrated these capabilities over time consistently, we now enjoy the confidence of our global aerospace and defence customers, who entrust us with long-term contracts. ” Azad has an order book of Rs 1,700 crore, exceeding 20 times its annual sales. This strong momentum, said Chopdar, has “led us to establish an additional manufacturing facility in Tuniki Bollaram, Telangana”.To accelerate growth, Unimech Aerospace and Manufacturing has been exploring acquisitions and JVs. “We are evaluating precision manufacturing targets, both in India and the US,” said company co-founder Rajanikanth Balaraman.India is also focusing on producing complex products and handling aircraft subassemblies. “We are gradually upgrading and building more complex products. The total SKUs that we have delivered until the end of June 2025 was 4,769, adding 381 new SKUs compared to March 2025,” said Balaraman.Data from IPO tracker Prime Database showed that SMPP and Aequs had received Sebi approval for Rs 4,000 crore and Rs 1,700 crore initial public offerings (IPOs).India currently just has a 2% share of the global aerospace supply chain, despite being a major aircraft buyer. However, players including Aequs believe that India's share will increase to 10% in the near future.“India is turning out to be a large aviation market for global companies. It will be 10% of the aviation market in the coming decade and we are just 2% of the supply chain. So that drives their top level thinking that where the market is, they also need to show there is significant procurement that happens,” said Melligeri.","The sector is gearing up to launch about Rs 5,700 crore of IPOs in the next few months.

FDI inflows plummet by over 68% to $1.1 billion in August,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/fdi-inflows-plummet-by-over-68-to-1-1-billion-in-august/articleshow/124731295.cms,"



NEW DELHI: Foreign direct investment (FDI) into India plunged by over 68% to $1.1 billion in Aug as gross investments fell 30%, while repatriations out of India held firm.As a result, on a net basis, there was FDI outflow of $616 million in Sept, compared with inflows of $1 billion a year ago, latest data released by RBI late Monday showed.Gross FDI into the country fell to $6 billion in Sept as against $8.7 billion in the corresponding period last year. At the same time repatriations and disinvestment in Indian entities through public offers and secondary sales are estimated to have declined 5.7% to $4.9 billion last month as against $5.2 billion during Sept 2024.While outward FDI also dropped by 32% during this period — from $2.5 billion in Sept 2024 to $1.7 billion last Sept — the investments into the country saw a sharper fall, and on a bigger base, resulting in net FDI outflows from the country.During April-Aug, however, net FDI more than doubled to $10.1 billion, as against $4.6 billion last year. It was driven by a 57% growth in inflows to over $22 billion, as against a 25% rise in outward FDI to $12.4 billion. In this period, overall foreign inflows, including portfolio investment, were down 59% to $6.4 billion as institutional investors withdrew $2.5 billion, largely from Indian stocks against net investment of over $11 billion.Govt has maintained it is focusing on stepping up FDI inflows, while insisting outward flows indicate greater integration of Indian firms with the global value chain.","Foreign direct investment (FDI) into India plunged by over 68% to $1.1 billion in Aug.

RBI: Lead merchant banks shape SME IPO demand,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/rbi-lead-merchant-banks-shape-sme-ipo-demand/articleshow/124731289.cms,"



MUMBAI: A study of the surge in fundraising by Indian SMEs through IPOs in FY24 and FY25 published by RBI has found that the reputation of the lead merchant banker is the single biggest factor determining success.According to the report, investor demand is shaped less by the issuing company’s fundamentals than by the intermediary’s credibility and market standing.The analysis divided merchant bankers into top and non-top categories based on the value of IPOs they managed. Subscription rates for issues handled by top-ranked bankers were on average twice those managed by others.“Analysis shows that subscription rates of IPOs managed by the top merchant banks or lead managers are on an average twice as those managed by others,” the study said. The authors attributed this to investor trust in reputed intermediaries.“Reputed merchant banks are typically more trusted by investors due to their strong track record, global presence, and market expertise,” they said.Their networks and institutional reach “help generate demand even before the IPO launches, significantly increasing the likelihood of oversubscription,” the report added.The study noted that merchant bankers in SME listings play a larger role than just intermediaries.Apart from underwriting and marketing, they are required to act as mandatory market makers in the initial years after listing, ensuring liquidity. New regulatory proposals have also tightened accountability, making it mandatory for the lead banker to submit a due diligence report to the exchange at the time of filing the draft offer document.The study underscores the importance of due diligence, regulatory compliance, and data/fact/research driven investment decision in optimising IPO outcomes for both SMEs and investors.Authored by Bhagyashree Chattopadhyay and Shromona Ganguly, the report warned that retail investors often overlook risk amid the current enthusiasm for SME IPOs.",Investor demand is shaped less by the issuing company's fundamentals than by the intermediary's credibility and market standing.

(AI image)

Dhanteras 2025:

But will this rally continue? Are gold and silver good investment bets over the next year? We ask experts what the gold and silver price outlook is and what levels will they hit by Dhanteras 2026:

Dhanteras 2025: Should you buy gold and silver this year?

What’s the gold price outlook till next Dhanteras?

Gold — Diwali/Dhanteras 2026 target: ₹1,40,000–₹1,45,000+ Bull case 160000+ if geopolitical risk escalates or Fed turns very dovish. For the 12-month horizon to Dhanteras 2026, maintaining the bullish structural view, expect upside if the macro tailwinds persist — Fed cuts, weak dollar, tariffs/ geopolitical premium.Since the price has shown sharp up move recently, its advisable to allocate in dips and parts.

Silver — Dhanteras/Diwali 2026 target: ₹1,85,000–₹2,10,000/kg; Bull case ₹2,20,000–₹2,50,000+ on stronger industrial demand Central banks buying and continued ETF flows.

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market and other asset classes given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)





Buying gold and silver is traditionally considered auspicious on Dhanteras . The precious metals have been hitting new record highs this year - with the gold rally backed by global uncertainty and diversification away from dollar and the silver bull run driven by high industrial demand and acute physical tightness in London and Comex inventories.Investors who bet on gold and silver last Dhanteras and Diwali have seen bonanza returns. According to Manav Modi, Senior Analyst, Commodity Research at Motilal Oswal Financial Services, gold and silver on the domestic front have gained by over 61% and 69% respectively from 2024 Dhanteras to till now.Manav Modi is of the view that both gold and silver could be on dips from a long term perspective as an investment. “However, one should be cautious at these levels for a dip or profit booking which could provide a better entry or purchase level,” he tells TOI.Jateen Trivedi, VP Research Analyst - Commodity and Currency, LKP Securities believes that while gold and silver are good bets, investors should not chase the peak.“For festival buying (ritual/jewellery) buy as per need; for investment, favoursystematic accumulation (SIP/laddered buys), ETFs or Sovereign Gold Bonds (SGBs) over lump-sum physical purchases at all-time highs. Silver offers higher upside potential but comes with higher volatility,” he advises.Praveen Singh, Head of Commodities, Mirae Asset ShareKhan says that both gold and silver have strong fundamentals to rise further in the coming years.“⁠Both the metals are expected to gain further on economic, political, and geopolitical uncertainties as the US Federal Reserve cuts rates into elevated inflation. De-dollarization, central banks buying gold, inflation hedge buying, long-term government bonds losing their appeal, dent in investors’ trust in US institutions, and tariff wars will continue to provide strong tailwinds for precious metals,” he tells TOI.Gold and Silver are still poised for further upside, says Manav Modi. “Overall, from a one year perspective, Gold on COMEX could target $4250 and $4500 assuming USD-INR at 89; Rs 1,28,500 and 1,35,000. Similarly, Silver could target $75 on COMEX, from a long term perspective and Rs 2,30,000 on domestic front,” he says.Praveen Singh expects gold to reach $5000 sometime around next Dhanteras, while silver is expected to rise to $60 level. “So, silver can gain 17%, while gold may gain 21% in a year. However, due to physical market tightness in London and Indian Silver markets, it is possible that silver may beat gold in the short term, though we expect that this tightness will not last long,” he says.Abhilash Koikkara, EVP & Head- Forex and Commodities, Nuvama Professional Clients Group is of the view that over the next 12 months, silver could maintain its outperformance over gold as gold offers portfolio stability and capital protection. “From a technical perspective, silver exhibits stronger bullish signals compared to gold, indicating a higher likelihood of outperforming gold by Dhanteras 2026,” he tells TOI.“Analytically, gold suits conservative wealth preservation, while silver suits risk-adjusted alpha seekers,” he adds.Trivedi notes that Gold has compounded at roughly 30.6% p.a., Silver 33% p.a., and Nifty 24% p.a. — silver has outperformed in percentage terms recently though gold remains the steadier hedge.Trivedi highlights LKP Securities’s working framework and targets (domestic, per 10 g / per kg):","Investors who bet on gold and silver last Dhanteras and Diwali have seen bonanza returns. Both the metals are expected to gain further on economic, political, and geopolitical uncertainties as the US Federal Reserve cuts rates into elevated inflation.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124665282,imgsize-56388,width-400,resizemode-4/gold-price-outlook.jpg"
"H-1B fears cool, companies hiring from US campuses to gain",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/h-1b-fears-cool-companies-hiring-from-us-campuses-to-gain/articleshow/124731255.cms,"Big Relief For Indians: Donald Trump Clarifies $100K H-1B Fee Won’t Apply To Existing Visa Holders





BENGALURU: The Trump administration's decision to exempt those who are already in the US, including foreign students, from the $100,000 H-1B visa fee is a big win for US companies hiring such talent. Many of these are technology companies, for whom immigrant student talent has proved valuable.For Indian IT services companies, the decision may be less significant. They have historically been transferring talent from India on H-1Bs, and that talent will now require payment of the prohibitive $100,000 fee. But as the IT services companies have been pointing out, their dependence on H-1Bs has diminished substantially. They are increasingly hiring locals, and to the extent they do campus hires of those on F1 student visas, they too will benefit from the Trump administration’s latest decision.Phil Fersht, CEO at IT consulting firm HFS Research, says the new rules signal a move from volume-driven visas to value-driven visas. “The message is clear: the US wants fewer imported coders and more onshore AI engineers and domain experts,” he says, adding that it forces a reset of the old labour-arbitrage model, pushing IT services companies to invest more in local talent, “as they have already begun to do.”Vivek Wadhwa, CEO of Vionix Biosciences and former distinguished fellow at Harvard Law School and Carnegie Mellon, describes it as “a Trump taco, noise that scared everyone.”As it turned out, he says, it really doesn't impact the vast majority of people on H-1Bs. “It got Trump's base very excited but he misled them as he often does, he made a lot of noise and really didn't do anything. It created a big panic for a month and as it turns out there was nothing to worry about,” he says.Stephen Yale-Loehr, retired professor of immigration law practice at Cornell Law School, also notes that the latest decision means only a few people will be impacted.Indian IT companies file a few thousands of H-1Bs each year for employees in India. Since the first term of the Trump administration and the travel difficulties brought on by the Covid pandemic, IT services companies have been choosing to hire locally, or in near-shore locations like Latin America.Today, nearly 80% of the US workforce at firms like Wipro are local hires. Infosys CEO Salil Parekh has previously said that only a few employees use the firm's immigration services, the remaining already live in the US.TCS has previously said that each year only about 500 people go to the US on the H-1B visa, even though it files for a much larger number of these visas. For Indian students on F1 visas, the decision is a big blessing. They can hope to be hired by US enterprises or startups, since the companies will be exempt from paying the $100,000 fee for them.","Trump administration's decision to exempt those who are already in the US, including foreign students, from the $100,000 H-1B visa fee is a big win for US companies hiring such talent.

Canada inflation rises: CPI hits 2.4% in September amid rising food prices; Mark Carney optimistic on US tariff talks,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/canada-inflation-rises-cpi-hits-2-4-in-september-amid-rising-food-prices-mark-carney-optimistic-on-us-tariff-talks/articleshow/124725516.cms,"File photo: Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney (Picture credit: AP)





Canada’s annual inflation rate climbed to 2.4 per cent in September, slightly above analysts’ expectations, driven by rising grocery prices and moderated declines in gasoline costs, official data showed Tuesday.According to Statistics Canada, food prices rose 3.8 per cent year-on-year, marking the largest increase since April 2024, while gasoline prices declined less than in the same period last year.Excluding gasoline, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased 2.6 per cent. Shelter costs, particularly rents, also contributed, with a 4.8 per cent jump in September, taking overall shelter inflation to 2.6 per cent, according to Reuters.Economists highlighted that core inflation measures remained elevated. The CPI-median stayed at 3.2 per cent, while the CPI-trim edged up to 3.1 per cent, reflecting broad-based price pressures.According to news agency AFP, Prime Minister Mark Carney noted that the government was in “intensive” talks with the United States to reduce sectoral tariffs on steel, aluminum, and energy that have affected Canadian businesses and consumers.While about 85 per cent of cross-border trade remains tariff-free under the USMCA, Trump’s global tariffs have pressured key sectors, particularly steel, aluminum, and autos, leading to job losses and higher input costs.Carney expressed cautious optimism about a potential breakthrough in steel and aluminum, while noting that US auto tariffs remain a risk for Canada, as per AFP.The rise in prices comes ahead of the Bank of Canada’s next policy meeting later this month, with money markets pricing in a strong probability of a 25-basis-point rate cut to 2.25 per cent, aimed at supporting a slowing economy.Analysts have emphasised that despite inflationary pressures, the Canadian economy is weak and in need of monetary support, highlighting the delicate balance policymakers face.Consumers and businesses alike have felt the impact of tariffs and inflation. Canadian grocery stores, heavily reliant on US imports, have raised prices in response to trade measures, while broader sectoral tariffs have amplified costs across steel, aluminum and automotive industries.","Canada's annual inflation rate climbed to 2.4 per cent in September, slightly above analysts’ expectations.

Wall Street opened on a mixed note on Tuesday as investors assessed a wave of strong corporate earnings amid concerns about stretched valuations.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.1 per cent to 46,757.20, while the S&P 500 slipped 0.1 per cent to 6,731.14 and the Nasdaq Composite declined 0.3 per cent to 22,933.67, reported news agency AFP.General Motors (GM) surged 10.2 per cent after reporting quarterly results that surpassed analyst expectations and raising its full-year financial forecasts.According to news agency AP, CEO Mary Barra said the company is taking steps to curb losses in its electric vehicle business by 2026, noting that “it is now clear” EV adoption will be slower than previously planned.Energy services provider Halliburton and diagnostics firm Danaher also climbed more than 8 per cent each after reporting stronger profits than expected, while Coca-Cola rose 3.4 per cent and GE Aerospace advanced 4.2 per cent on upbeat earnings.Warner Bros. Discovery shares jumped 10.6 per cent after the company revealed it was considering a sale of all or part of its business “in light of unsolicited interest the company has received from multiple parties,” reported AFP.The move followed an earlier plan to split Discovery Global from Warner Bros.However, some stocks weighed on the market. PulteGroup fell 4.1 per cent despite better-than-expected profits, and Northrop Grumman slipped 2.3 per cent after missing revenue forecasts.Tech giants also took a breather, with Alphabet dropping 1.3 per cent from its record high, becoming the heaviest drag on the S&P 500, as per AP.Analyst Patrick O’Hare of Briefing.com said, “The overarching point this morning is that the earnings news for the September quarter continues to be better than expected, and, most importantly, the guidance has been generally reassuring,” according to AFP.Meanwhile, CFRA Research’s Sam Stovall cautioned that “investors are also getting a little concerned by stretched valuations,” amid strong year-to-date gains.Overseas, markets in Europe and Asia were broadly higher. Japan’s Nikkei 225 rose 0.3 per cent, nearing the 50,000 mark, after conservative lawmaker Sanae Takaichi became prime minister, with investors expecting pro-growth policies.Shanghai gained 1.4 per cent and Hong Kong rose 0.7 per cent amid hopes that President Donald Trump may meet Chinese President Xi Jinping later this month to ease trade tensions, reported AP.In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 3.95 per cent from 4.00 per cent on Monday.","The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.1 per cent to 46,757.20.

Donald Trump tariffs: US 40% trans-shipment levy intended for China could end up hitting Asean supply chains including India; Moody’s flags risks,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/donald-trump-tariffs-us-40-trans-shipment-levy-intended-for-china-could-end-up-hitting-asean-supply-chains-including-india-moodys-flags-risks/articleshow/124719683.cms,"File photo (Picture credit: AP)





The 40 per cent trans-shipment tariff recently announced by the United States is expected to create significant compliance challenges for companies in India and the ASEAN region, particularly in sectors such as machinery, electrical equipment and semiconductors, Moody’s Ratings said on Tuesday.In July, US President Donald Trump imposed the tariff on goods deemed to have been transshipped, adding to broader country-level tariffs.Moody’s noted that the administration has yet to clarify the precise definition of trans-shipment, though the measures appear aimed at products originating in China and routed through third countries with lower duties, as per news agency PTI.“The lack of clarity around the trans-shipment tariff poses risks to ASEAN economies. If the US maintains a narrow interpretation—targeting only minimally processed Chinese goods re-exported to the US—the impact may be limited. However, a broader approach, covering goods with any significant Chinese input, could damage the Asia-Pacific supply chain,” the report said.Moody’s highlighted that private sector exporters will likely face heightened due diligence and certification requirements, needing to prove “substantial transformation” of goods to avoid penalties.The sectors most exposed include machinery, electrical equipment, semiconductors, and consumer optical products, with trans-shipped goods concentrated in intermediate inputs rather than final consumer items.Trans-shipment, a legal practice involving the transfer of goods through hubs such as ports and rail terminals, supports logistical efficiency and supply chain flexibility.However, it can also be used to obscure product origin to evade tariffs—a concern the US seeks to address with this new measure.While Moody’s indicated that Asean’s manufacturing competitiveness will largely remain intact, noting lower labour costs and ongoing “China+1” diversification strategies, the rating agency warned that the tariff could disrupt regional supply chains and increase operational costs for companies heavily reliant on Chinese inputs.Countries most exposed include Vietnam, Malaysia, and Thailand, given their deep integration with Chinese supply chains, with key sectors facing potential credit pressures spanning electronics, solar energy, automotive, machinery, and semiconductors.India could face similar compliance and operational challenges in sectors such as machinery, electrical equipment and consumer optical products, including semiconductors.The move signals the US administration’s increased scrutiny of global trade flows, especially concerning tariff evasion, and may compel companies to reassess sourcing, certification, and logistical arrangements across Asia-Pacific markets.","The 40 per cent trans-shipment tariff recently announced by the United States is expected to create significant compliance challenges for companies in India and the ASEAN region.

'Shameless Schumer': Mike Johnson RIPS 'Lying Democrats' Amid One Of Longest U.S Govt Shutdowns





British consumer goods giant Unilever has postponed the planned demerger of its Magnum Ice Cream business, citing the ongoing US federal government shutdown as the reason for the delay, according to multiple reports.The New York Stock Exchange listing for The Magnum Ice Cream Company, which includes brands such as Ben & Jerry's and Cornetto, cannot proceed because the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is currently unable to declare the registration statement effective, reported news agency AFP.The primary listing had been scheduled for November 10 in Amsterdam, with secondary listings planned in New York and London. Unilever will retain a 19.9 per cent stake in the standalone ice cream business, as per news agency Reuters.The three-week federal shutdown, the longest full closure in US history, has disrupted IPO approvals and affected several sectors, with economists estimating costs of up to $15 billion per week in lost output.DeepGreenX Group, a Seoul-based green energy company, also withdrew its US direct listing due to the shutdown, highlighting wider market disruption.Preparatory work for the demerger remains on track, and Unilever has reassured investors that it is committed to completing the spin-off within 2025, although the timeline will be revised, according to Foodbev Media.Anna Farmbrough, UK quality portfolio manager at Unilever investor Ninety One, was quoted by Reuters as saying, “We’re not concerned by the delay. The timing of the listing isn’t especially important in the broader context — what matters is the quality of the underlying business and its long-term growth prospects”.The demerger is part of Unilever’s broader strategy to streamline operations and focus on core brands.

"'To provide clarity on future governance': Ozempic-maker Novo Nordisk to shake up board; move comes after 9,000 layoffs",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/to-provide-clarity-on-future-governance-ozempic-maker-novo-nordisk-to-shake-up-board-move-comes-after-9000-layoffs/articleshow/124722581.cms,"(Photo credit: AP)





Denmark's Novo Nordisk, the pharmaceutical giant behind blockbuster drugs Ozempic and Wegovy, is set for a major boardroom shake-up amid internal disagreements and growing competitive pressure in the weight-loss drug market.The company on Tuesday announced that it will replace more than half of its 12-member board, including its chair, following a dispute with its majority shareholder, the Novo Nordisk Foundation, over the company’s future governance.The extraordinary shareholders’ meeting is scheduled for November 14, marking a turning point for the world’s leading anti-obesity drugmaker, which has also recently changed its CEO and announced 9,000 layoffs as part of a cost-cutting drive.In a statement, board chair Helge Lund said that after failing to reach an understanding, ""the board concluded that it is in the best interest of the company and its shareholders to convene an extraordinary general meeting to elect new board members to provide clarity on the future governance of Novo Nordisk.""The shake-up comes as Novo Nordisk faces slowing sales growth and intensifying competition in the US market, leading it to cut its profit growth forecast for the third time this year, AFP reported.Once Europe’s most valuable company thanks to the runaway success of its weight-loss injections, Novo Nordisk has seen its share price tumble over the past year. As of Tuesday afternoon, its shares were down 1.4%.According to the company, seven of the 12 current board members will step down, including vice chair Henrik Poulsen and directors Laurence Debroux, Andreas Fibig, Sylvie Gregoire, Christina Law, and Martin Mackay.The foundation, which holds about a quarter of Novo Nordisk’s shares but controls three-quarters of the voting rights, will propose Lars Rebien Sorensen, its current chairman and Novo Nordisk’s former CEO (2000–2016), to replace Lund as board chair.In a separate statement, Sorensen said the foundation fully supports new chief executive Mike Doustdar and his transformation plan. ""We believe it is time to bring in new competencies and perspectives to the Board to support Mike Doustdar and his leadership team in executing on the company’s strategy,"" he added.The Novo Nordisk Foundation is also nominating Cees de Jong to replace Henrik Poulsen as vice chair. The sweeping governance overhaul, combined with leadership changes and layoffs, signals a period of deep transition for Novo Nordisk as it seeks to maintain its dominance in the booming but increasingly crowded anti-obesity drug market.","Denmark's Novo Nordisk is set for a major boardroom shake-up amid internal disagreements and growing competitive pressure in the weight-loss drug market.

US Capitol EXPLODES: Hakeem Jeffries DESTROYS 'GOLFER' Trump, Mike Johnson In DIRECT Shutdown Attack





As the US government shutdown enters its third week, air traffic controllers are being forced to find second jobs to make ends meet. Many are now driving for Uber, delivering food or working in restaurants after their regular shifts.Deemed essential workers, thousands of air traffic controllers must continue working despite not being paid since the shutdown began on October 1. The funding lapse has left them without regular income and many are struggling to cover basic expenses, according to a report by Forbes.Nick Daniels, president of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association (NATCA), said the situation has become dire. “We’re told we’ll get paid eventually, but that doesn’t pay the mortgage, gas, or food bills,” he said. “No one takes IOUs.”Controllers, already under immense pressure due to chronic staff shortages, are now working up to 60 hours a week while taking on additional jobs to survive.“They’re finishing their shifts, then driving for Uber or serving tables in the evening,” Daniels said.Before the shutdown, the aviation sector was already grappling with a decade-long shortage of air traffic controllers. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) reported that 91% of control centers were operating below recommended staffing levels even before the crisis.Transportation secretary Sean Duffy said staffing in some areas has now been cut by up to 50%, partly because some controllers are calling in sick.NATCA, which represents over 20,000 aviation safety professionals, is working with banks to arrange no-interest loans for affected workers.Many senior controllers have also stepped in to support new recruits who recently relocated for their first postings without guaranteed pay, providing meals and other assistance.Airline crews, including Alaska Airlines pilots, have been delivering food to control towers, while Canadian and Australian controllers have sent support packages.Experts warn that prolonged financial stress and exhaustion could impact flight operations. While flight safety remains uncompromised, the ongoing crisis could lead to more delays and cancellations as morale drops.According to FlightAware, over 7,800 flight delays and 117 cancellations were recorded on Sunday alone. Earlier this month, more than half of 23,000 delays in a single week were linked to staffing shortages, a figure that typically stands at only 5%.Daniels urged political leaders to end the shutdown, saying the burden on workers is unsustainable.“That’s why the American people—we’re asking them to continue to stand up and say, ‘End this shutdown now.’ There is no scenario where we just have a game plan for no one having any money and continuing to work,” Daniels said.","Deemed essential workers, thousands of air traffic controllers must continue working despite not being paid since the shutdown began on October 1.

US steers away from China: Trump seals $8.5 bn deal with Australia for rare earth; 'we'll have so much critical minerals',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-steers-away-from-china-trump-seals-8-5-bn-deal-with-australia-for-rare-earth-well-have-so-much-critical-minerals/articleshow/124713484.cms,"Trump's Rare Earths 'Bargain'; Offers To Lower Tariffs On China If... | ‘Give Us Some Things Too’





The United States has turned to Australia in efforts to counter China’s influence over critical minerals.US President Donald Trump and Australian PM Anthony Albanese on Monday, signed a landmark $8.5 billion agreement as they met at the White House.The deal commits both nations to invest $1 billion each over six months in mining and processing projects, and sets a minimum price for critical minerals. A White House statement said the projects will tap deposits worth $53 billion, though it did not specify exact types or locations, according to Reuters.Trump told reporters, “In about a year from now, we'll have so much critical mineral and rare earths that you won't know what to do with them.”The US Export-Import Bank announced seven letters of interest totalling over $2.2 billion for Australian projects, involving firms such as Arafura Rare Earths, Northern Minerals, Latrobe Magnesium, VHM, RZ Resources, Graphinex, and Sunrise Energy Metals. These minerals are essential for defence systems, aerospace, communications equipment, and next-generation technologies. EXIM said the investments will also help “counter China’s export dominance and ensure Western supply-chain resilience.The Pentagon plans to build a gallium refinery in Western Australia after China blocked exports of the metal to the US last December. Critical minerals like rare earths, lithium, and nickel are vital for everything from electric vehicles to military radars, Reuters reported.Trump also expressed support for Australia’s $239 billion AUKUS submarine project. Under the 2023 agreement, Australia will buy US nuclear-powered submarines in 2032 and later develop a new class with Britain. Trump described remaining issues as “just minor details” and said the project will now proceed “full steam ahead, building.”The rare earths deal includes faster permitting for mines and processing facilities, collaboration on mapping and recycling, and measures to prevent sales of critical mineral assets “on national security grounds,” a clear reference to China’s global mining investments, including the world’s largest cobalt mine in Congo.","US President Donald Trump and Australian PM Anthony Albanese on Monday, signed a landmark $8.5 billion agreement as they met at the White House.

HONG KONG: Poor coordination between the UN’s climate and aviation frameworks is undermining global decarbonization efforts, leaving airlines solely responsible for meeting obligations that states themselves helped create, said IATA’s Senior Vice President for Sustainability and Chief Economist, Marie Owens Thomsen,Speaking at a press briefing, Thomsen said there is a “severe design flaw” in how the UN’s International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) operate — despite both being made up of the same member states.“The UN member states, who are all members of ICAO, voted for and agreed on CORSIA and imposed it on airlines — and airlines accepted that,” she said.“The same UN member states then move over to the UNFCCC and COP processes, and there they seem to forget that ICAO exists, that ICAO has governance authority and the power to set standards for global civil aviation.”The Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), developed by ICAO, requires airlines to offset emissions above 85% of 2019 levels by purchasing approved carbon credits.After a voluntary start, CORSIA becomes mandatory from 2027 for most countries. Airlines will then be legally bound to monitor, report, and offset emissions.Thomsen said the disconnect between ICAO’s CORSIA scheme — which requires airlines to offset emissions growth — and the UNFCCC’s Paris Agreement processes has created confusion and inefficiency. “At the COP, they forget all of that and only focus on the nationally determined contributions, the NDCs,” she said.According to her, the result is an imbalanced system where airlines are required to buy eligible carbon credits, but states face no corresponding obligation to supply them.“We have to go beyond the NDCs and align the fact that the states have optionality to supply these to airlines, whereas airlines have an obligation to buy them. That is just Alice in Wonderland stuff,” she said.Thomsen said that the situation reflected not just policy gaps but a communication failure between the two UN systems. “I’m willing to concede that it’s a market failure by not communicating,” she said. “The UNFCCC people have not communicated with ICAO and have simply missed the fact that states should obviously have an obligation to issue.”Calling for better alignment between ICAO and UNFCCC frameworks, she urged governments to ensure policy coherence and shared responsibility for aviation decarbonization. “The COP people need to align with the ICAO people so that we can have a rational future together,” she said.","Poor coordination between the UN’s climate and aviation frameworks is undermining global decarbonization efforts, says IATA.

The airline industry faces an “epic market failure” in its quest to decarbonize, with both sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) and eligible carbon credits falling dramatically short of demand, said Marie Owens Thomsen, Senior Vice President of Sustainability and Chief Economist at the International Air Transport Association (IATA) on Tuesday.Speaking at the ongoing IATA World Sustainability Symposium in Hong Kong, Thomsen warned that the global aviation sector’s climate ambitions were being stifled not by lack of solutions, but by policy fragmentation and limited government coordination.“These two things — sustainable fuels and eligible carbon credits — are in eye-watering short supply and fall way, way short of airlines’ demand,” she said. “This is a market failure of epic proportions that could be, and can be, avoided.”Thomsen called for globally harmonized rules and certifications, coupled with “radical collaboration amongst all governmental departments” and “risk mitigation frameworks” that would allow all stakeholders to share the financial and technological risks of developing new decarbonization solutions.“What we’re getting instead,” she said, “is fragmentation, need-first policies, higher costs, and very little decarbonization.”Thomsen urged policymakers to view air transport not merely as an industry but as a strategic tool for economic policy. “If we were able to recognize that air transportation is not just an industry but actually a tool for economic policy, then things would surely be different,” she said.Emphasizing that technology and scientific solutions already exist, she added: “We know there is a way. We know how to do this. We have the solutions in the labs. We are just not getting them out and into the airplanes. This is not a situation where ‘where there’s a will, there’s a way’ — no. This is a situation where therea way.”IATA has been highlighting the airline industry's increasing regulatory pressure to meet net-zero targets without adequate policy alignment or fuel availability.The Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), developed by ICAO, requires airlines to offset emissions above 85% of 2019 levels by purchasing approved carbon credits.After a voluntary start, CORSIA becomes mandatory from 2027 for most countries, including India.

Declares War As Trump Sued Over $100,000 H-1B Visa Fees

Who are exempted from paying $100,000



How to pay new fees

Who are the F-1 and L-1 visa holders ?





A month after US President Trump announced a jaw-dropping $100,000 price tag for certain visa applicants, the administration has finally spilled the details on how to pay up—and who might get a free pass.USCIS on Monday rolled out a payment portal and clarified that only applicants with a receipt showing the fee has been submitted can move forward, while some, like student visa holders, might dodge the surcharge entirely.The new USCIS guidelines said existing visa holders, which include international students on F-1 visas and professionals on L-1 visas, will not have to pay $100,000 when they apply for a change of status to H-1B.“It says the fee only applies to cases filed for people outside the United States, so they can come in,” said Dan Berger of Green & Spiegel in an interview, as per Forbes.“Employers were nervous about doing change of status because the $100k might apply if they travel.”The guidance explicitly states, “The Proclamation also does not apply to a petition filed at or after 12:01 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time on September 21-2025, that is requesting an amendment, change of status, or extension of stay for an alien inside the United States where the alien is granted such amendment, change, or extension.Further, an alien beneficiary of such petition will not be considered to be subject to the payment if he or she subsequently departs the United States and applies for a visa based on the approved petition and/or seeks to reenter the United States on a current H-1B visa. ”However, the guidance also states that an employer would need to pay the fee if USCIS determines, such as by denying an application, that an individual is ineligible for a change of status or an extension of stay.For example, USCIS states the H-1B fee would apply if the individual “is not in a valid nonimmigrant visa status or if the alien departs the United States prior to adjudication of a change of status request.”USCIS states that any holder of a current H-1B visa, or any alien beneficiary following petition approval, can travel in and out of the United States. According to USCIS, “The Proclamation does not apply to any previously issued and currently valid H-1B visas, or any petitions submitted prior to 12:01 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time on September 21-2025.”Petitioners should submit the required $100,000 payment using pay.gov, following the instructions on pay.gov at the following link: https://www.pay.gov/public/form/start/1772005176 After clicking on the link, it states: “Use this form to pay your H-1B VISA PAYMENT TO REMOVE RESTRICTION.” Many employers hope it may be possible to gain an exception from the fee to file H-1B visas for individuals located outside the United States.According to the section of the presidential proclamation addressing an exception, “The restriction imposed . . . shall not apply to any individual alien, all aliens working for a company, or all aliens working in an industry, if the Secretary of Homeland Security determines, in the Secretary’s discretion, that the hiring of such aliens to be employed as H-1B specialty occupation workers is in the national interest and does not pose a threat to the security or welfare of the United States. ”The USCIS guidance appears more restrictive and less welcoming than the language of the proclamation. The USCIS guidance inserts words or phrases that do not appear in the proclamation, including “extraordinarily rare,” “high threshold,” “significantly undermine” and “no American worker is available to fill the role.”According to USCIS, “Exceptions to the $100,000 payment are granted by the Secretary of Homeland Security in the extraordinarily rare circumstance where the Secretary has determined that a particular alien worker’s presence in the United States as an H-1B worker is in the national interest, that no American worker is available to fill the role, that the alien worker does not pose a threat to the security or welfare of the United States, and that requiring the petitioning employer to make the payment on the alien’s behalf would significantly undermine the interests of the United States. ”The F-1 Visa (Academic Student) allows you to enter the United States as a full-time student at an accredited college, university, seminary, conservatory, academic high school, elementary school, or other academic institution or in a language training program. You must be enrolled in a program or course of study that culminates in a degree, diploma, or certificate and your school must be authorized by the U.S. government to accept foreign students.And the L-1A nonimmigrant classification enables a US employer to transfer an executive or manager from one of its affiliated foreign offices to one of its offices in the United States. This classification also enables a foreign company that does not yet have an affiliated U.S. office to send an executive or manager to the United States with the purpose of establishing one.The employer must file a Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker, with fee, on behalf of the employee.","USCIS on Monday rolled out a payment portal and clarified that only applicants with a receipt showing the fee has been submitted can move forward.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021.

How India's GDP has been growing

What SBI report said on savings and investment

Incremental capital output ratio

NEW DELHI: India's gross domestic product (GDP) data for the third quarter (October-December 2022) received a word of caution from the former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan In an interview with news agency PTI, Rajan that India is ""dangerously close"" to the Hindu rate of growth in view of subdued private sector investment, high interest rates and slowing global growth.India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying"".However, a report released by the State Bank of India (SBI) economists on Tuesday dismissed arguments that India is dangerously close to Hindu rate of growth saying such statements are ""ill-conceived, biased and premature"".The term 'Hindu growth rate' was coined by late economist Raj Krishna in 1978 to describe the slow growth in the country.It basically refers to the low pace of economic growth rates during 1950s to 1980s. During this period, the Indian economy averaged 3.5%.A former lecturer at the Delhi School of Economics (DSE), Krishna noted that only if the rate of growth is persistently slow and accompanied by low per-capita GDP, then it will be known as Hindu rate of growth but it has to factor in population growth as well.Before economic reforms of 1991, India's economic growth remained stagnant and low, while per capita income averaged around 1.3%.Krishna termed this low growth situation to be a result of socialist policies of state control and import substitution.However, the economic situation changed when liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation (LPG) reforms came into effect in the year 1991, at a time when India faced balance of payment crisis.Over the years, many economists have strongly opposed the idea of 'Hindu growth rate' and the term never had universal acceptance.The Indian economy plunged into its very first technical recession in FY21 due to the impact of Covid-19 pandemic and the related nationwide lockdowns. GDP shrunk by an unprecedented 23.8% in the first quarter of the financial year 2020-21. However, due to spurt in economic activities in the subsequent quarters, the GDP decline started to narrow.However, if we look at the period before Covid-19 as well, India's growth curve shows a declining trend.From 8.26% in FY17, GDP growth plunged to 3.74% in FY20. Shutdown of economic activities in FY21 in wake of Covid-19 only made matters worse.As lockdowns started to ease and business activities resumed, India's GDP also started rising. In Q1 of FY22, growth jumped to 20.1% mainly on account of low base effect. By the fourth quarter of FY22, growth came down to 4.10%.Similarly, the new financial year 2022-23 brought fresh economic challenges in the form of Russia-Ukraine war that impacted almost all major economies of the world, slowed the pace of growth, pushed inflation to record highs.As a result, the central banks of all advanced economies spurred into action and opted for monetary policy tightening to curb the soaring inflation.With persistently rising interest rates, India's economy grew by 4.4% in Q3 of FY23, as the Centre revised upwards GDP growth for previous year to 9.10% from 8.7% earlier.The report weighed recent GDP numbers against the available data on savings and investments for the past decade and highlighted some interesting points.""Quarterly growth numbers are noisy and should be best avoided for any serious interpretation (on an average, India's GDP growth has witnessed Rs 2 lakh crore upward revision for the 3 year ended FY23),"" the report said.Gross capital formation (GCF) by the government touched a high of 11.8% in 2021-22, up from 10.7% in 2020-21.""This also had a domino effect on private sector investment that jumped from 10 per cent to 10.8% over the same period,"" it said.In fact, Ecowrap added that the trends in GCF to gross output ratio or the plough back of funds for creation of fresh capacity shows that for public administration the ratio attained fresh peak in 2021-22 owing to the emphasis on capital expenditure in recent budgets.At the aggregate level, gross capital formation is supposed to have crossed 32% in 2022-23, the highest level since 2018-19.According to the report, in 2021-22, gross savings have risen to 30% from 29% in 2020-21.""The ratio is supposed to have crossed 31 per cent in 2022-23, the highest since 2018-19. The household savings increased sharply during the pandemic period on account of sharp accretion in financial savings such as deposits,"" said the report by SBI's Economic Research Department.While household financial savings have since then moderated from 15.4% in 2020-21 to 11.1% in 2022-23, savings in physical assets have grown sharply to 11.8% in 2021-22 from 10.7% in 2020-21.The report further analysed Incremental Capital Output ratio (ICOR) -- which measures additional units of capital (investment) needed to produce additional units of output. It said that the ratio has been improving.""ICOR which was 7.5 in FY 12 is now only 3.5 in FY22. Clearly, only half of capital is now needed for next unit of output,"" the report noted.Such reducing ICOR in the current years reflects a relatively increasing efficiency of capital and shows that the economy is on a sound footing, the report said.""From that point of view, future GDP growth rates even at 7% could still mean a decent number by any standards!,"" it added.","India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%. Raghuram Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying""","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-98483158,imgsize-65724,width-400,resizemode-4/98483158.jpg"

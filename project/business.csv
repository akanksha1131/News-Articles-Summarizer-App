Will the flow of Russian crude completely stop?

US President Donald Trump’s sanctions on two of Russia’s biggest oil majors - Rosneft and Lukoil - come into effect today - November 21, 2025 which was set as the wind-down deadline by the US Treasury Department. Will the move finally get Trump what he wants - that India stops buying oil from Russia?The Trump administration announced sanctions on Open Joint Stock Company Rosneft Oil Company (Rosneft) and Lukoil OAO (Lukoil), alleging that their financial contributions support Moscow's military operations in Ukraine. The European Union has also implemented restrictions prohibiting the purchase of petroleum products that are derived from Russian crude oil, which begin from January 2026.Trump has imposed a 25% penal tariff on Indian exports in lieu of its crude oil imports from Russia and this has been an impediment in the ongoing discussions for a trade deal with India. While the tariffs have not deterred India from buying Russia’s crude, the sanctions on Russian oil majors may have the desired effect.Russian crude loadings headed for India have dropped sharply - at ~982 kbd in November till 20th November, according to data from Kpler, a global real-time data and analytics provider. This is the lowest level since October 2022.“While volumes may still shift, as some in-transit vessels could revise their final destinations, the trend is clear: India-bound flows are softening. Loadings have already slowed since 21 October, though it is still early for definitive conclusions given Russia’s agility in deploying intermediaries, shadow fleets, and workaround financing,” says Kpler.According to a Bloomberg report, approximately 48 million barrels of Russian oil could become stranded at sea. This could cause several vessels to urgently seek new delivery locations. This development would mark another significant disruption in international oil trade.Experts are of the view that Trump’s sanctions on Rosneft and Lukoil will serve to be an effective measure to get India to diversify away from Russian crude oil imports. As per data, Russia has supplied approximately 34% of India's crude oil this year, of which Rosneft and Lukoil have contributed approximately 60% in volume. With these two Russian oil majors being sanctioned, Indian refiners have little option but to stop procuring from them, at least for export purposes.Kpler predicts that with the November 21 deadline, Indian refiners (except Nayara), will stop direct procurement of crude oil from the sanctioned Russian entities.This is expected to cause a significant reduction in Russian oil deliveries to India, particularly during December and January, it says.According to Sumit Ritolia, Lead Research Analyst, Refining and Modelling at Kpler, the recent US sanctions on Rosneft and Lukoil represent a meaningful escalation and are set to temporarily reshape India’s crude import flows—even if they do not alter New Delhi’s long-term strategy of maintaining diversified, cost-advantaged supply.While shipments have decreased since October 21, it is still premature to draw any conclusions on Russian imports being completely halted since Russia has in the past shown its ability to utilise intermediaries, shadow fleets, and workaround financing.Kpler is of the view that refineries will adopt a more conservative approach, utilising non-sanctioned traders, mixed oil sources, and sophisticated logistics to reduce their exposure to Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) regulations. “Russian supply will not disappear but will increasingly move through opaque channels,” says Sumit Ritolia of Kpler.At present, the shipping patterns indicate significant changes in Russian oil trading practices, characterised by unexpected route changes between India and China, alongside unusual Ship-to-Ship transfers near Mumbai's coastline, away from conventional transfer points near the Singapore Strait. These developments reflect evolving logistical tactics by Russian exporters navigating tightening Western sanctions, says Kpler.Reliance Industries Ltd, which is the main purchaser of Russian crude oil, has said that it will stop importing from Russia at its export-focused refinery in Jamnagar, Gujarat. RIL’s move aligns with the US and EU sanctions.""We have stopped importing Russian crude oil into our SEZ refinery with effect from November 20,"" RIL said on Thursday.RIL’s Jamnagar facility has two distinct units - there is an SEZ refinery that is dedicated to exports for the US, European Union, and other international markets - alongside a conventional unit that refines to serve domestic needs.From December 1, all product exports from the SEZ refinery will be obtained from non-Russian crude oil…The transition has been completed ahead of schedule to ensure full compliance with product-import restrictions coming into force in January 2026,” said RIL.India’s imports of Russian crude went up substantially after the latter offered oil at huge discounts following the start of its war with Ukraine. Before the Russia-Ukraine war, the share of Russian crude in India’s oil import basket was negligible. Since then it has gone up to almost 40%.In the run up to the November 21 wind-down deadline set by the Trump administration, India’s crude imports from Russia are expected to remain very strong — around 1.8–1.9 Mbd — as refiners continue to prioritise the most economical barrels ahead of the sanctions cutoff, says Kpler.After that imports are expected to decrease significantly in the immediate term, as shipments from Rosneft or Lukoil post-November 21 would face higher sanctions exposure and scrutiny.“Based on current understanding, no Indian refiner other than Nayara’s already-sanctioned Vadinar facility is likely to take the risk of dealing with OFAC-designated entities, and buyers will need time to reconfigure contracts, routing, ownership structures, and payment channels,” says Kpler.So what will India do now that Russian oil majors have been sanctioned? Kpler says that India has several options available to meet its needs.Given their sophisticated processing capabilities, Indian refiners can technically manage the replacement of Russian volumes, though this would impact profit margins for some facilities, it says.According to Kpler, Indian refiners are diversifying their crude oil sources to offset the impact of reduced Russian supplies. They are likely to source crude from:Freight costs on long-haul routes will cap substitution potential, but the overall import basket is likely to widen, says Sumit Ritolia.There is also the important point that India can continue to import Russian crude oil from non-sanctioned entities.The current sanctions specifically target Rosneft and Lukoil and their majority-owned subsidiaries, rather than all Russian oil producers.This means that crude supplied by non-designated Russian entities — for example Surgutneftegaz, Gazprom Neft, or independent traders using non-sanctioned intermediaries — can still be legally purchased by Indian refiners, as long as no sanctioned entity, vessel, bank, or service provider is involved, says Kpler.However, there are two significant challenges to that:1. Operational risks increase for all suppliers, including non-sanctioned ones, as OFAC might expand designations, whilst traders, banks, and insurers could reduce their involvement to avoid secondary sanctions.2. Supply volumes may not completely replace Rosneft/Lukoil quantities immediately, given their dominant position in Russia's export infrastructure and blend composition.Whilst non-sanctioned Russian producers can maintain supply chains, they face operational constraints and heightened risks, particularly if Western sanctions intensify or expand beyond currently designated entities.According to Kpler, there's been a noticeable uptick in undisclosed cargoes leaving Russian ports. “Many of these tankers had previously been discharged in India, indicating a potential continuation of flows via less transparent channels,” says Kpler.“However, diversions to other Asian buyers cannot be ruled out. For now, November buying remains fluid, but the drop in declared India-bound volumes aligns with expectations as refiners move cautiously ahead of the 21 November OFAC wind-down deadline,” it says.While the Trump administration and EU’s sanctions are expected to be a temporary jolt for Russian crude trade, its oil is unlikely to completely disappear from the world markets. Russia is an important supplier of oil in the world and its abrupt withdrawal from the market may cause price disruptions.“Despite near-term declines, a complete halt to Russian imports is unlikely. Discounted Russian barrels remain attractive for margins, and India’s energy policy continues to prioritise affordability and security over geopolitical pressure,” notes Kpler’s Sumit Ritolia.“Unless secondary sanctions directly target Indian buyers or New Delhi imposes formal restrictions—both low-probability scenarios—Russian crude will keep flowing to India, though via increasingly diversified and less transparent channels,” he adds.The long-term outlook depends entirely on how strictly the West enforces secondary sanctions and the potential introduction of any additional measures, such as sanctions on all Russian oil or even penalties for refineries that are processing Russian crude. Stricter enforcement would reduce volumes of Russian crude imports further, whilst a lenient implementation may allow for some recovery through intermediary channels.“Russian crude flows are entering a phase of heightened uncertainty and volatility as the supply chain adapts. New trading intermediaries, alternative shipowners, evolving payment mechanisms, STS transfers, and a shift toward “clean” (non-designated) sellers will all shape post-November trade,” says Kpler.“Until refiners gain clarity on compliant pathways — including secure non-sanctioned counterparties, shipping and insurance availability, and workable banking solutions — India’s imports from Russia will remain in choppy waters, marked by short-term disruptions (i.e., lower arrivals) and frequent shifts in sourcing patterns,” concludes Sumit Ritolia.",US President Donald Trump's sanctions on two of Russia's biggest oil majors - Rosneft and Lukoil - come into effect today. Trump has imposed a 25% penal tariff on Indian exports because of its crude oil imports from Russia.

Crypto crash: Bitcoin sinks below $82k; tech slump spills into crypto markets-here's what analysts say,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/crypto-crash-bitcoin-sinks-below-82k-tech-slump-spills-into-crypto-markets-heres-what-analysts-say/articleshow/125489985.cms,"$1.2 trillion crypto value wiped out

Corporate crypto holdings under pressure

Bitcoin and ether tumbled to multi-month lows on Friday as investors pulled back from riskier assets amid concerns over stretched tech valuations and fading expectations of near-term US rate cuts, Reuters reported.Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency , dropped 5.5% to a seven-month low of $81,668, while ether slid more than 6% to $2,661.37, hitting a four-month low.Both tokens have fallen roughly 12% this week, erasing Bitcoin’s year-to-date gains and pulling ether nearly 19% lower for the year.The sell-off comes as volatility spikes across equity markets, particularly high-flying artificial intelligence stocks. Analysts said the retreat signals a broader shift away from speculative assets. “If it’s telling a story about risk sentiment as a whole, then things could start to get really, really ugly, and that’s the concern now,” said Tony Sycamore, market analyst at IG, according to Reuters.The market value of all cryptocurrencies has dropped by about $1.2 trillion in six weeks, CoinGecko data showed. Shares of Hong Kong-listed spot bitcoin ETFs from China AMC, Harvest and Bosera fell close to 7% on Friday.Bitcoin’s fall follows a rally earlier this year that pushed it above $120,000 in October, driven by favourable regulatory developments. However, analysts say last month’s record one-day crash — which triggered $19 billion in liquidations — has left sentiment fragile. “The market feels a little bit dislocated, a bit fractured, a bit broken,” Sycamore said, quoted Reuters.Citi analyst Alex Saunders noted that $80,000 is a key level because it is close to the average purchase price of ETF-held bitcoin.The downturn has dragged crypto-linked stocks lower. Strategy, once seen as a flagship corporate bitcoin accumulator, has fallen 11% this week and traded near one-year lows, Reuters said. JP Morgan warned the firm could be removed from some MSCI equity indices, potentially forcing index-linked funds to sell.Japan-based Metaplanet has plunged about 80% from its June peak, while crypto exchange Coinbase is on track for its longest losing streak in over a month. Miners MARA Holdings and CleanSpark dropped 2.4% and 3.6%, respectively, and newly listed Gemini has sunk 62% from its debut.Digital asset research firm CryptoQuant said conditions were deteriorating sharply. “Bitcoin market conditions are the most bearish they have been since the current bull cycle started in January 2023,” it said, adding that “we are highly likely to have seen most of this cycle’s demand wave pass.”","World's largest cryptocurrency drops 5.5% to a seven-month low of $81,668.

Only 6 of 46 Indian EVs qualify for govt benefits as China-driven component imports dominate supply chain,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/only-6-of-46-indian-evs-qualify-for-govt-benefits-as-china-driven-component-imports-dominate-supply-chain/articleshow/125508084.cms,"AI Image

NEW DELHI: The China factor weighs heavily on India’s emerging electric car market as the domestic supply chain for the green cars is still inadequate in key areas such as batteries, semiconductors and magnets.Consider this: of the 46 EV car models sold in the country, only six have been found eligible for benefits under the production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme of the govt as they meet the domestic value-add (DVA) mandates.The rest were marked as ineligible for PLI as the cars carried imported content more than the stipulated levels with large amounts of parts coming in from China, sources told TOI.The incentives are given out by the Ministry of Heavy Industries (MHI), and the criteria for allotting PLI is that a model needs to have at least 50% local content in its composition. a relaxation on import of battery cells effectively takes the DVA cut-off even lower to 40%.“The six approved models include five cars from Tata Motors and one from Mahindra. All the other models sold in the market, including from companies such as JSW MG, BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Hyundai, Kia, Citroen, VinFast, Volvo, Tesla and Audi, have over 60% imported content,” one of the sources said.The EV models that have made the PLI cut are – Tata Nexon, Tata Punch and Tata Harrier SUVs, Tata Tiago hatch, and Tata Tigor sedan.The sixth model is the newly-launched Mahindra XEV9E which also meets the DVA criteria.Interestingly, Tata’s Curvv EV and Mahindra’s BE6 green also do not meet PLI’s local value-add criteria, despite other models from the companies making the cut.Officials from companies whose models did not make the cut said that meeting the DVA criteria at such a nascent stage of EV adoption remains challenging.“The local supply ecosystem for EVs is still not as evolved as it is in the internal-combustion engine (ICE) category. Also, with limited sales of the greens, it is quite challenging and practically unviable to ask our supply chain partners to come to India,” a top functionary of a leading European automaker said, requesting anonymity.So what are the parts that are being imported for the EVs? “These include lithium-ion battery cells; rare earth magnets; DC Motors; laminated stators; semiconductor chips; printed circuit boards, and electronic child parts, all of which are coming from China. Then you have connectors; contactors; relays, and DC-DC converters which come from China and Taiwan,” one of the sources said, citing a detailed study that was carried out by PwC on localisation of EV component supply chain in India.The source said that there are currently “very limited local options” for most of these components as China – and to some degree Taiwan – controls most of the global supplies.","Of the 46 EV car models sold in the country, only six have been found eligible for benefits under the production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme.

India is planning to roll out an inbuilt travel insurance component in air tickets within next 2-3 months that could mean getting anywhere upto 80% refund for last-minute exigency cancellations.As of now, a cancellation within three hours of departure time is treated as a no-show and no refund is given. If passengers are able to prove their medical emergency for their last-minute cancellation, airlines may give a full refund. But this is purely discretionary.Sources say the aviation secretary is in discussions with Indian carriers to see how best the inbuilt insurance plan can be rolled out atno cost to passengers with the premium being borne by airlines through their arrangement with insurance companies. As of now, insurance is an add on service that travellers can buy if they opt for the same.A leading airline has begun talks with insurance companies for having this as an inbuilt component. “We are exploring whether an insurance element can be added in the lowest fare (category) so that passengers get some refund. The details are being worked out,” said a senior official of this carrier.""The uncertainty of being able to travel and then the fear of losing money or facing trouble in getting the refund is a big factor in many people avoiding booking flights.We keep getting complaints about someone not being able to travel due to a tragedy in immediate family and then not getting a refund. This uncertainty of getting money back has to go and refunds have to become seamless. Our very rough estimate is that a reasonable premium amount of about Rs 50 on every ticket can lead to refunds of upto 80% on tickets cancelled upto four hours before departure time,"" said sources close to the development.Airline officials say online travel agencies (OTA) already ""nudge"" travellers to take an insurance while booking tickets. ""We are working out the math with insurance companies. Eventually these companies have to figure out the risk-reward ratio to see what they can offer. In case of last-minute cancellations, insurance companies will have to pay the refund. If 2-3 out of 200-300 people do so for genuine reasons, the math will work out,” said an airline official.According to OTAs already offering this, insurance companies dive into historical cancellation data that includes the ratio of last-minute cancellations and the reasons for doing so. If the ratio is low, then the reward outweighs the risk for them. Higher the chances of getting a claim, higher is the premium. Accordingly, there are tailor-made insurance products that people can opt for.Aviation authorities realise refunds have become a major pain point for travellers. Apart from this inbuilt insurance being planned by the aviation ministry, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) is in the process of changing its current refund rules to make them more passenger-friendly.""Issue of refund of tickets by airlines has become a major source of grievance amongst airline passengers. Large number of complaints are regularly received which can broadly be divided into: delay in refund of unused tickets; amount refunded by airlines against cancelled tickets and policy of not refunding ticket amount but adjusting against tickets to be purchased by the passenger for future travel in the same airline that too valid for a limited time,"" the DGCA said in its draft rules regarding “refund of airline tickets to passengers” while seeking comments from the public on the proposed changes. The final rules will be issued after taking into account stakeholders' comments.While govt does not want to interfere in the commercial practices of airlines, “the volume of complaints necessitates some affirmative action to safeguard the interest of the traveling public…. onus rests with govt to fix some minimum benchmarks, as far as the refund policy is concerned, in order to stem the growing dissatisfaction among the passengers regarding the refund procedures adopted by some airlines.”","India is planning to roll out an inbuilt travel insurance component in air tickets within next 2-3 months.

He said several Indian institutions that initially hesitated to participate in global ranking frameworks later gained insights into research quality, employability, gender representation and SDG-linked performance once they engaged with systems like QS and Times Higher Education rankings.He cited cases where better datasets, documentation and employer outreach enabled Indian universities to climb globally, underscoring the importance of data frameworks generated by ministries, national ranking bodies and global institutions.The CAG asked trainee officers to strengthen financial transparency, ensure proper account maintenance and build resilient administrative systems to unlock funding opportunities and improve outcomes.He advised civil servants to stay grounded, remain accessible to citizens and draw from institutional experience to eliminate bureaucratic bottlenecks that affect transparency and public trust. The quality of governance they deliver, he said, will depend on “integrity, competence and willingness to learn.”Murthy also inaugurated the Khel Mahotsav (Sports Meet) of the 100th Common Foundation Course.","Comptroller and Auditor General of India K Sanjay Murthy said expanding access, strengthening data-driven governance and advancing institutional maturity in financial management are key pillars for achieving the Viksit Bharat vision.

New rules to reshape HR policies, pay structures

Execution remains biggest challenge

The newly notified labour codes mark a historic shift for India’s gig economy, formally bringing millions of delivery partners, ride-hailing drivers and platform workers under a recognised social security framework for the first time.The overhaul transitions gig workers from the fringes of the unorganised sector into a regulated system with access to protections such as provident fund benefits, ESIC coverage, insurance, and mandatory appointment letters, experts said, reported news agency PTI.“For the first time, this rapidly expanding segment of the workforce, traditionally excluded from the conventional employer-employee relationship, gains legislative recognition and a foundational layer of social security,” said Preetha S, Partner, JSA Advocates & Solicitors.She added that the move also places new compliance responsibilities on platform companies, requiring contributions towards social welfare measures for workers.Major gig-economy players signalled support for the changes and said they were evaluating operational adjustments.“We welcome the government's intent to implement labour reforms, and we are evaluating the changes that have to be ushered in,” an Amazon India spokesperson said.A Rapido spokesperson said strengthening social security for gig and platform workers was “vital for long-term resilience and inclusion”.Eternal, parent entity of Zomato and Blinkit, said the labour codes would strengthen social security access without harming business viability. Zepto said the move protects workers “without losing the flexibility that powers quick commerce”.India had 77 lakh gig workers in 2020-21, according to NITI Aayog, with the workforce projected to rise to 2.35 crore by 2029-30. TeamLease estimates the current gig workforce at around one crore.“For years, the country's gig workers subsidised its growth from the margins. Today, they step into the system,” said TeamLease Regtech CEO Rishi Agrawal, PTI quoted him as saying.According to EY India’s Puneet Gupta, the reforms introduce clarity and standardisation across compliance requirements.“For workers, the impact is significant; formal employees gain stronger protections and uniform benefits, while gig and platform workers are included in social security schemes for the first time,” he said.He added that compensation structures and employment models may be reshaped as firms align with uniform wage definitions and labour protections.Experts cautioned that applying a formal benefits system to a workforce defined by flexibility, shifting hours and multiple income sources could complicate documentation and continuity of benefits.“The real test will be fitting a steady employment framework into a world where work is fluid… The direction of the codes is sound, but the ecosystem will need discipline and cooperation to make it real,” said Kartik Narayan, CEO of jobs marketplace Apna.Lohit Bhatia, President, India & Global Operations at Quess Corp, said real-time compliance and grievance resolution at scale would require strong digital systems and behavioural change.However, he added that simplified compliance frameworks, unified registers and national licensing “remove many previous bottlenecks and create a more modern, digital-first environment” to support responsible growth.","The overhaul transitions gig workers from the fringes of the unorganised sector into a regulated system with access to protections.

(With agency inputs)

NEW DELHI: The national capital woke up to dense smog on Monday, with the average Air Quality Index (AQI) at 359 at 7 am — classified as 'very poor' — despite the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP)-III being in effect across Delhi and the National Capital Region (NCR), according to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB).A thick layer of smog continued to blanket Delhi on Monday, showing little improvement from Sunday’s AQI of 385.Bawana recorded the highest pollution level at 427, falling under the ‘severe’ category, while NSIT Dwarka reported the lowest at 225, according to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB).Iconic areas like India Gate and Kartavya Path were shrouded in toxic smog, with AQI readings of 341 (‘very poor’). Other hotspots included Chandni Chowk (383), RK Puram (366), ITO (394), Punjabi Bagh (384), Patparganj (369), Pusa (365), and Dwarka Sector-8 (356).Meanwhile, Anand Vihar remained engulfed in a layer of toxic smog, with the CPCB reporting an AQI of 383, classified as ‘very poor’.The thick smog, along with deteriorating air quality, mercury continued to hover around the 9 Degree Celsius mark, with some areas recording even lower temperatures.As per CPCB classification, an AQI between 0-50 is considered 'good', 51-100 'satisfactory', 101-200 'moderate', 201-300 'poor', 301-400 'very poor', and 401-500 'severe'.Following the deteriorating air quality in the national capital, the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) III was implemented on November 11 across Delhi by the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM). The measures aim to control emissions through stricter restrictions on construction, vehicular movement and industrial operations.Under GRAP-III, restrictions include a ban on most non-essential construction, limits on BS-III petrol and BS-IV diesel vehicles, suspension of in-person classes for students up to Class 5 with a shift to online or hybrid learning, curbs on industries using non-clean fuels, and a ban on non-emergency diesel generators.Earlier, the Supreme Court directed the governments of Punjab and Haryana to file a status report on the measures taken to curb stubble burning, which contributes to the air pollution crisis in the Delhi-NCR region.A bench of Chief Justice of India BR Gavai and Justice K Vinod Chandran ordered, ""We direct the state of Punjab and Haryana to file a report on what steps are being taken to curb stubble burning.""Since Diwali, air quality in Delhi and the NCR has remained in the 'very poor' to 'severe' categories in several areas, despite Stage III of the GRAP being in effect.","The national capital woke up to dense smog on Monday, with the average Air Quality Index (AQI) at 359 at 7 am.

Manufacturing hit by rising prices and weak demand



Tariffs squeeze households, sentiment weakens



Services sector keeps overall activity steady



US manufacturing slipped to a four-month low in November as tariffs pushed up prices and dampened demand.According to news agency Reuters, the slowdown caused a build-up of unsold goods, raising concerns that it may drag down wider economic growth.S&P Global said the flash US manufacturing PMI eased to 51.9 from 52.5 in October, with new orders dropping to 51.3 and inventories rising to the highest level recorded in the survey.Chris Williamson of S&P Global Market Intelligence said manufacturers faced “a worrying combination of slower new orders growth and a record rise in finished goods stock,” cautioning that output may weaken further unless demand revives.Reuters reported that consumers are increasingly reluctant to buy long-lasting manufactured goods. The University of Michigan’s latest survey showed a sharp fall in purchasing conditions, adding that “consumers remain frustrated about the persistence of high prices and weakening incomes.”US President Donald Trump’s tariffs have pushed up import costs, placing additional pressure on lower- and middle-income families.A recent stock-market sell-off has also dented confidence among wealthier Americans, who had earlier supported spending.Economist Sung Won Sohn was quoted by Reuters as saying that those at the lower-income end “will probably not spend very much,” adding that uncertainty in markets “is going to hurt even the spending of wealthier people, especially retirees.”Despite the factory-sector slowdown, broader business activity remained solid.The US Composite PMI Output Index rose to 54.8, supported by a stronger services sector. Reuters reported that services PMI climbed to 55.0, driven by better new business orders and improved confidence linked to expectations of further rate cuts, the end of the 43-day government shutdown and easing political concerns.Consumer sentiment inched up to 51 in the University of Michigan survey, though it stayed below October’s level. Joanne Hsu, who heads the survey, said sentiment among households with large stock holdings dropped due to late-month market declines.Inflation pressures remained elevated, with businesses reporting higher input costs and increased prices for goods and services.Consumers also expect stronger inflation in the next year, Reuters said, even as five-year expectations eased slightly to 3.4%.Though the PMI suggested no sharp deterioration in the labour market, hiring softened marginally, with private-sector employment slipping to 51.0 amid tariff-related cost concerns.","US manufacturing slipped to a four-month low in November as tariffs pushed up prices and dampened demand.

Broader markets weigh on sentiment

Investor appetite remains strong despite volatility

Key IPO candidates for 2026 include Databricks, Canva, and Plaid, AP reported.

The strong run in US initial public offerings has lost momentum due to the government shutdown and increased investor caution, as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) works through a backlog of regulatory filings, according to market participants.Many IPOs expected in late 2025 are likely to be pushed to 2026 as the SEC clears “hundreds of registration statements,” AP reported. Listings that did debut recently have seen limited gains amid concerns that stocks have become expensive following another year of double-digit market returns.“A backlogged SEC, the approaching holiday slowdown, and pressure on AI and other tech stocks are all weighing on hopes for a near-term rebound,” Bill Smith, CEO of Renaissance Capital, said in a note to investors.Despite delays, several IPOs already advanced through the regulatory pipeline are expected to list in November and December.Central Bancompany, which went public after the shutdown, raised $373 million through its IPO on Thursday. November remains on track to be among the slowest IPO months of 2025, Renaissance Capital said.Upcoming large listings could include medical supplies company Medline, potentially raising up to $5 billion in December, while cryptocurrency technology firm BitGo also remains a candidate for a listing next month.Shares of Figma, which tripled on debut after pricing at $33 per share in July, are now trading slightly above their IPO price. Swedish buy-now-pay-later firm Klarna, priced at $40 in September, is now trading near $29.Cloud services company CoreWeave, listed at $40 in March, jumped initially but has retreated to around $72. Software firm Navan, listed at $25 during the shutdown, is now trading near $15.The S&P 500 has fallen 3.5% in November, driven by a slide in technology shares following concerns about valuations tied to artificial-intelligence-linked stocks. However, the index is still up more than 12% this year, while the Nasdaq has gained over 15%.Renaissance Capital’s IPO Index is down about 0.8% this year and has lagged the S&P 500 since mid-October.“What that shows is that investors very quickly monetized, they didn't want to take the long-term risk,” said Samuel Kerr, head of global equity capital markets at Mergermarket.Analysts say high valuations in public markets may continue to push investors toward IPOs as alternative entry points.“Increasingly, as a money manager, you have to find other places to make money and typically, IPOs are that place,” said David Kaufman, partner and co-chair of the corporate & securities practice at Thompson Coburn LLP, AP quoted. “You continue to have all these large mutual funds and money managers with excess cash and no place to put this cash.”The slowdown masks a surge in behind-the-scenes activity, Kaufman added: “It’s a busy time for lawyers and bankers trying to tee things up for the first and second quarter of next year.”",Many IPOs expected in late 2025 are likely to be pushed to 2026.

Inside the loop: What are circular Deals



The loop is tight, lucrative, and increasingly enormous.

But why do they exist?

So are we in a bubble?



first need to look at the scale of the investments:

A market bigger than pharma

OpenAI’s revenue and the pricing question



Would raising prices fix OpenAI’s financial pressure?

How Oracle became an unlikely winner



Oracle invests in the infrastructure OpenAI needs.

OpenAI commits to spending billions on Oracle Cloud to run its models.

Oracle gains a marquee client and a narrative shift that boosts investor confidence.

Echoes of the dot-com bubble - and what burst it



It wasn’t one factor it was a cluster of external shocks:

Antitrust action against Microsoft: The US government’s lawsuit rattled confidence in the entire tech sector. The perception of regulatory overreach pushed investors to reassess risk. Corporate accounting scandals: MicroStrategy famously restated its financial results, triggering panic around revenue inflation across the industry. The broader macro unwind: The housing market began showing cracks; interest rates shifted; capital costs rose. Companies dependent on cheap financing suddenly found credit scarce. Telecom overbuild and bad debt: Cisco, Lucent and others extended supplier financing to customers who were effectively insolvent. When those loans went bad, the write-downs cascaded.

Has AI faced a similar shock yet?



Regulatory scrutiny has been loud but not existential.

OpenAI’s internal governance turmoil did not derail the company.

Supply chain shortages have slowed but not stopped GPU availability.

High interest rates have not dried up capital for AI megaprojects.

So, this is sustainable?



Investors are split.

The bullish case

AI is transformative Compute demand is compounding Early investment will pay off across decades Circular deals are simply a modern way to bootstrap hyper-scale infrastructure

The bearish case

The sector’s valuations rely on uninterrupted optimism Cash flows are disguised by internal loops Capital expenditure requirements are too high for current revenue One external shock could trigger cascading losses

A revolution built on a loop



Three years ago, generative AI was barely on anyone’s radar. Three months ago, circular deals were whispered about only in private meetings at big banks. Weeks and days ago, these loops were still a niche topic. Today, they are all anyone on Wall Street can talk about.As investments swell: from $100 billion chip deals to multi-gigawatt data-centre projects, questions are mounting.The first question is:A growing number of AI firms and their partners are engaging in “circular” financing, a loop in which the same companies that pour money into AI start-ups are also the ones selling them the infrastructure they need to survive.It has created what can be described as an ouroboros ecosystem, a self-feeding financial creature devouring its own tail. And as the numbers balloon from $100 billion chip deals to multi-gigawatt data-centre projects questions are rising about how sustainable this loop really is.Circular deals are straightforward in theory but unusually powerful in practice. An AI company receives immense investment from a tech giant and then commits to spending that money back with the same investor on cloud compute, chips, and infrastructure.Take one of the clearest examples: Microsoft and Nvidia’s multi-billion-dollar commitments to Anthropic. The start-up received around $15 billion from the two giants, but simultaneously committed to spend $30 billion on Microsoft’s Azure cloud and Nvidia GPUs. On paper, it looks like a huge show of confidence in Anthropic. In reality, a large portion of that investment will flow straight back into the pockets of Microsoft and Nvidia via long-term infrastructure contracts. OpenAI , the sector’s flagship, takes this circularity even further. Nvidia has reportedly pledged up to $100 billion in investment; OpenAI, in turn, is one of the largest buyers of Nvidia GPUs on the planet. AMD struck similar agreements, providing next-generation chips while granting OpenAI warrants that allow it to buy a stake in AMD for a symbolic price meaning OpenAI pays AMD for hardware while simultaneously holding equity that benefits if AMD succeeds.Meanwhile, Oracle is deeply embedded as OpenAI’s cloud backend. The two companies are building new AI super-data-centres under a partnership nominally worth over $300 billion. OpenAI receives compute capacity now but is committed to paying Oracle roughly the same amount over the next five years.SoftBank’s arrangements with OpenAI operate in the same space: it injects capital into the company and simultaneously builds infrastructure for OpenAI’s Stargate project, which OpenAI then commits to paying for across the next decade.The AI boom’s most limited resource is not talent or data, it's computers. Training frontier AI models requires hundreds of thousands of GPUs and vast amounts of power.This is why many deals are measured not in dollars but in gigawatts (GW).A single gigawatt is a staggering unit:1 GW ≈ the electricity consumption of 750,000 homes.Next-generation AI data centres increasingly require sites of 1–4 GW each. OpenAI’s planned megasite in Texas is expected to consume power on the scale of a small country. These sites need dedicated substations, transmission lines, cooling farms and, in some cases, on-site power generation.Because the capital expenditure is so immense, AI companies need partners that can supply cash and infrastructure. Cloud providers and chipmakers fit the bill but they recoup their investment by locking start-ups into massive, long-term spending commitments.The economics are daunting: McKinsey estimates that meeting global AI compute demand will require $7 trillion in capital expenditure by 2030. Bain has issued similar warnings, noting that the gap between current AI revenue and required future revenue to sustain that expenditure is in the hundreds of billions annually.A simple way to answer whether there is an AI bubble is to start with the generative models themselves. For example, when ChatGPT is asked, “Are we in an AI bubble?” it responds: “Yes, (in the short term).”“Short-term: Yes, there’s over-exuberance. Some of the money is flowing into speculative plays, and not every AI startup will survive,” ChatGPT opined.“Medium to Long-term: Even if there’s a “pop” or correction, I don’t think AI goes away. The infrastructure (data centers, chips, cloud) and real use-cases are likely to persist and mature,” it said in its long term prediction.Elon Musk's Grok agreed that we are in an AI bubble but offered an optimistic view, saying it’s not “the kind that will inevitably end in total catastrophe like the dot-com crash or 2008.”“Yes, I think we're in an AI bubble—though not the kind that will inevitably end in total catastrophe like the dot-com crash or 2008. It's more like a frothy, speculative swell built on genuine technological promise, where valuations have raced ahead of near-term realities, and a correction feels overdue,” Musk’s chatbot said.Gemini described the current moment as a small bubble of investor excitement sitting on top of a much larger, long-term technological shift. In its view, only weaker players and short-term bets are at risk, because the underlying technology remains solid.But to really understand if there is a bubble, weNothing illustrates the speculative scale better than Nvidia. The company’s market capitalisation is now larger than the entire global pharmaceutical industry combined. The comparison is striking:Pharma is a century-old sector with regulated demand, stable revenue and essential products.Nvidia is riding a single theme - AI compute whose long-term commercial returns are still unproven.Investors have embraced the idea that AI will reshape the global economy. But the sheer size of these valuations has led some analysts to warn that even small disappointments in AI adoption could trigger disproportionately large corrections.This is one reason high-profile investors like Michael Burry famous for “The Big Short” have reportedly shorted companies tied closely to the AI boom, including OpenAI-related plays and Palantir. His bearish stance signals that not everyone is convinced the sector can sustain its current velocity.OpenAI reportedly generated around $12 billion in annual revenue. That figure represents enormous traction for an eight-year-old company but its operating costs still exceed its income. Training frontier models like GPT-5 costs billions, and inference expenses (the cost of running the models) rise with user demand.This raises an uncomfortable question:Possibly but at a cost.OpenAI’s mainstream foothold depends heavily on consumer adoption and developer usage. Its subscription tiers, API pricing and enterprise contracts are designed to drive volume, not maximise margin. A significant price hike could slow the growth that its entire valuation depends on.Moreover, the company faces fierce competition: Anthropic, Google DeepMind, Meta, Mistral, and a rapidly rising open-source ecosystem. In a market shaped by hype and experimentation, raising prices too aggressively risks sending developers elsewhere.Thus OpenAI is caught in the classic innovator’s dilemma:Charge more and risk losing scale, or maintain low prices and burn cash.Oracle might appear an unusual beneficiary of the AI boom but its entanglement with OpenAI is one of the most strategic plays in the industry.Oracle’s cloud business historically lagged behind AWS, Azure and Google Cloud. Enter AI: the OpenAI partnership has repositioned Oracle as a critical provider of GPU capacity, filling its data centres with high-margin compute workloads.The $300 billion-plus partnership is effectively a circular loop:The arrangement is lucrative but also risky. If AI growth slows, Oracle could be left with overbuilt infrastructure, echoing the telecom overcapacity of the dot-com era.The parallels with the late-1990s tech boom are more than rhetorical. The mechanism is similar: companies inflated each other’s valuations through investment loops and customer financing schemes.But the more important lesson comes from why the dot-com bubble burst.What killed the dot-com boom was not the failure of the technology, it was the collapse of the financial scaffolding.AI is now building an even bigger, more interconnected one.So far, the AI sector has weathered every potential disruption:In other words: the external shock hasn’t arrived yet.But history suggests that when investment loops are this tightly interwoven, it only takes one disruption, a regulatory hit, a liquidity crunch, an accounting scandal, or a sudden slowdown in AI adoption for the system to reprice violently.In this sense, the AI boom stands at a crossroads similar to 1999–2000: dazzling technological promise intertwined with fragile financial engineering.Circular AI financing is brilliant, aggressive and deeply risky. It has enabled the fastest infrastructure build-out in tech history, compressed into just a few years. But it has also created a tightly coupled financial ecosystem where companies invest in each other, buy from each other and depend heavily on mutual success.If AI delivers the productivity surge its champions predict, the investment loops will look visionary. If it falters, the ouroboros may finally bite too hard and unravel the most expensive technology cycle in a generation.Time, and perhaps an external shock, will reveal which way the loop bends.","A growing number of AI firms and their partners are engaging in ‘circular’ financing. The same companies that pour money into AI start-ups are also the ones selling them the infrastructure they need to survive. It has created what can be described as an ouroboros ecosystem, a self-feeding financial creature devouring its own tail.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125505457,imgsize-1202775,width-400,resizemode-4/are-we-in-an-ai-bubble.jpg"

US Shutdown ‘Ends’ After 40 Days; Senate Passes Bill After Dems ‘COMPROMISE’ With House GOP | WATCH

The US government will not release official inflation or jobs figures for October after the record-long shutdown prevented statisticians from gathering essential data, leaving the Federal Reserve without two major indicators ahead of its December policy meeting.The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) confirmed on Friday that the October consumer price index (CPI) has been cancelled because staff were unable to collect the survey information in time, as per Reuters.“BLS is unable to retroactively collect these data,” the agency said, adding that only a few indexes based on nonsurvey data could be reconstructed. Where possible, October values will be issued alongside November’s CPI report on 18 December.The shutdown—which lasted 43 days from early October to mid-November—also forced the cancellation of the October employment report.While October nonfarm payroll figures will be combined with November data on 16 December, the unemployment rate for that month “will never be known”, reported Reuters.A similar message was delivered in Washington on Friday, with the BLS reiterating that survey-based data simply “was not gathered” during the stoppage, reported news agency AFP.The agency noted that CPI collection typically relies on in-person visits to retailers, including supermarkets, and telephone interviews. Household survey data for the jobs report is gathered in the same way.The cancellations have intensified uncertainty for the Federal Reserve, which meets on 9–10 December.Fed Chair Jerome Powell recently compared navigating the economy without standard datasets to “driving in the fog”, reported The Guardian.“What do you do if you’re driving in the fog? You slow down,” he said last month.Fed officials were already under pressure, with inflation still above typical levels and policymakers weighing whether to deliver another rate cut.A speech by New York Fed President John Williams on Friday added to expectations of a possible adjustment, saying he saw “room for a further adjustment in the near term”, according to The Guardian.The September jobs report, released with delays because of the shutdown, showed 119,000 jobs added but the unemployment rate rising to its highest level since 2021.The full October labour market report will never be published, although the job creation figure for that month will appear alongside November’s release a week after the Fed’s meeting.The shutdown has already pushed back a series of economic indicators, including retail sales and trade data, as per AFP.It comes as President Donald Trump’s tariffs continue to complicate inflation pressures, with some Fed officials considering holding rates steady for longer.",US government will not release official inflation or jobs figures for October after record-long shutdown.

US court enters $1 billion default judgment against Byju Raveendran,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-court-enters-1-billion-default-judgment-against-byju-raveendran/articleshow/125498536.cms,"File photo: Byju Raveendran (Picture credit: IANS)

BENGALURU: The Delaware Bankruptcy Court has entered a default judgment of more than $1.07 billion against Byju Raveendran, after finding that the edtech founder repeatedly failed to comply with court-ordered discovery in the Byju’s Alpha adversary proceeding.A default judgment is a ruling issued when a party does not participate in the litigation or ignores court orders, allowing the court to decide the case without a trial.The ruling, issued on November 20 and reviewed by TOI, awards $533 million in damages for what the court described as fraudulent transfer of Byju’s Alpha’s funds in 2022, and another $540.6 million tied to the transfer of the debtor’s interest in Camshaft Capital Fund, a US hedge fund.The court also ordered Raveendran to provide a “full and accurate accounting” of the Alpha Funds and any proceeds that flowed from subsequent transactions.Judge Brendan Shannon wrote that the relief granted was “extraordinary” but justified, citing what he called an “extensive and repeated pattern of delay and obfuscation.”The order recounts multiple missed deadlines, incomplete filings, non-appearances, and non-payment of earlier sanctions, including a $10,000-per-day fine imposed in July for civil contempt.The adversary case was brought by Byju’s Alpha Inc., the US unit currently in Chapter 11 bankruptcy, along with GLAS Trust, the loan agent that now controls the debtor.They allege that more than half a billion dollars was “spirited away” from the company and routed through various entities beyond the reach of creditors. Raveendran has denied wrongdoing in earlier filings and has argued that discovery requests were improper or unnecessary; the court rejected those objections.The judgment comes alongside a separate filing earlier this week in which the bankruptcy estate submitted a sworn declaration from UK businessman Oliver Chapman, describing how the disputed funds allegedly moved through his firm, OCI Limited, before being routed to a Singapore entity the debtor claims was linked to Raveendran.That motion seeks court approval for a settlement with Chapman and marks the most detailed account yet submitted to the court on the alleged movement of the Alpha Funds.The defense further claimed that “the monies from the Alpha loans were not used by Byju Raveendran or any founder for their personal gain but were used for the benefit of Think & Learn Private Limited (TLPL).”It alleged that GLAS Trust “has been aware” of this, and accuses the lender-appointed agent of “misleading” the Delaware court.Raveendran’s lawyers added that he and other founders are preparing US federal claims alleging “racketeering and obstruction of justice,” seeking not less than $2.5 billion in damages and said these actions will be filed “before the end of 2025.”",Delaware Bankruptcy Court has entered a default judgment of more than $1.07 billion against Byju Raveendran.

(With inputs from agencies)

Japan currently finds itself stuck between a rock and a hard place. On the geopolitical front, Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi’s hawkish stance linking Taiwan’s security to Japan’s own has ruffled feathers in Beijing. China has already fired back with economic warnings—from freezing film approvals to squeezing seafood imports—signaling that Tokyo is in a delicate diplomatic bind.But the real storm is brewing at home. In a bid to soothe a public weary of inflation, the government is unleashing a massive stimulus package worth ¥21.3 trillion (roughly $135 billion). While the cash injection might help voters, it’s rattling a bond market that was already on edge. With the Bank of Japan (BoJ) stepping back and interest rates creeping up, bond yields are hitting levels not seen since the 2008 financial crisis.This marks the end of the ultra-loose monetary policy that defined Japan for decades. Now, analysts are asking the uncomfortable question: Can the world’s most indebted nation manage its towering debt without breaking something in the global financial system?Here is an explainer on why Japan’s bond market has suddenly become the world's biggest worry.Simply put, Japanese Government Bond (JGB) yields are breaking out. The 10-year yield recently flirted with 1.8%—a high water mark not seen since 2008—while the 30-year yield pushed past 3.3%. For a country where ""zero interest"" was the status quo for a generation, this is a seismic shift.Why it matters: Japan isn't just any economy; it is the world’s largest creditor nation. Japanese investors have trillions of dollars parked in global assets, from US Treasuries to Australian real estate. If domestic bonds suddenly offer a decent return, that money might pack its bags and head back to Tokyo. This repatriation of capital could drain liquidity from markets like the US and India, causing ripple effects everywhere.Japan’s debt-to-GDP ratio has sat around 230% for years without causing a crisis. The difference today is the timing.The government is launching a massive ¥21.3 trillion spending spree to fight inflation exactly when the central bank is trying to stop buying so many bonds. Usually, central banks buy bonds to keep yields low; with the BoJ stepping back, the market has to absorb this new debt, pushing yields up.As Mizuho’s Saori Tsuiki noted, the sheer size of the stimulus sends a risky message. If the market believes the government has lost its fiscal discipline, investors might discount the economic benefits entirely, leaving Japan with just the debt and none of the growth.For decades, shorting Japanese bonds (betting that yields would rise) was nicknamed the ""widow-maker"" trade. Traders who tried it got wiped out because the Bank of Japan had an unlimited checkbook to keep yields at zero.But the widow-maker has finally woken up. Over the last year, the BoJ has:As Bloomberg put it, we are watching a market that was artificially engineered by a central bank trying to learn how to be a ""normal"" market again. The safety net is gone.The carry trade was the financial world’s favorite free lunch. Investors borrowed yen cheaply (because Japanese rates were zero), converted it to dollars, and bought higher-yielding assets like US stocks or Indian bonds.However, as Japanese yields rise, two things happen:This destroys the profit margin of the trade. Investors are now forced to sell their foreign assets to pay back their yen loans—a process called ""unwinding."" This is why a small rate hike in Tokyo can trigger a massive sell-off in the S&P 500.The ""bond vigilantes"" are spotting cracks in the foundation. Recent auctions for long-term bonds (20 to 40 years) have seen weak demand, a clear sign that investors are hesitant to lend to the government long-term.Investors know that defense spending and social security costs are only going up. S&P Global Ratings analyst Rain Yin pointed out that Japan faces undeniable spending pressure on these fronts. If the government has to issue record amounts of debt to pay for it, and there are fewer buyers, yields have nowhere to go but up.If yields keep rising, it creates a nasty feedback loop:Yes, and that is exactly why economists are raising eyebrows.The government claims it is trying to thread a needle—supporting the economy without fueling inflation. But pouring cash into an economy struggling with high prices usually just fans the flames. Yuichi Kodama of Meiji Yasuda suggests this might be political theater: the spending is likely a way for the Takaichi administration to show they care about the public’s struggle, even if it risks spooking the markets.India is in the blast radius. If Japanese yields become attractive, Japanese funds might pull capital out of Indian bonds and equities. Furthermore, as the ""carry trade"" unwinds, global investors tend to go ""risk-off,"" pulling money out of emerging markets to cover their losses elsewhere. This often leads to volatility in the rupee and Indian stock indices.Is this the big crash, or just a return to normalcy? There are three main views:Most analysts expect a mix of all three. But one thing is certain: the days of ignoring Japan’s bond market are over. It has gone from a predictable sleeper to a source of potential global volatility.","Japanese bond yields are hitting levels not seen since the 2008 financial crisis.

Nvidia chip smuggling: Four charged in US over illegal exports to China; lawmakers urge stricter rules,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/nvidia-chip-smuggling-four-charged-in-us-over-illegal-exports-to-china-lawmakers-urge-stricter-rules/articleshow/125488914.cms,"Representative image

Defendants, charges and alleged methods



Legislative response and strategic concerns



The US justice department has charged four individuals in a scheme to illegally export Nvidia AI chips to China, highlighting challenges in enforcing US high-tech export restrictions.The indictment, unsealed Thursday in US district court in Tampa, Florida, accuses two US citizens and two Chinese nationals of conspiring to ship Nvidia GPUs without required licenses, using fake contracts and false documentation to disguise shipments through Malaysia and Thailand.According to court documents, 400 Nvidia A100 GPUs were successfully exported to China between October 2024 and January 2025, while attempts to export 10 Hewlett-Packard supercomputers with H100 GPUs and 50 H200 GPUs were stopped by law enforcement, reported CNBC.The scheme allegedly used a Tampa company, Janford Realtor, as a front for the transactions, funded with nearly $4 million in wire transfers from China.One defendant, Brian Curtis Raymond, 46, from Huntsville, Alabama, is identified as the former CTO of an AI cloud company in Virginia, which confirmed he is no longer employed there, reported CNBC.Raymond, along with co-defendant Mathew Ho (Hon Ning Ho), 34, a US citizen born in Hong Kong, allegedly coordinated the shipments, knowing the chips would ultimately be sent to China.Two other defendants, Jing (Harry) Chen, 45, and Tony Li, 38, both Chinese nationals, are also charged.Charges include conspiracy to violate the Export Control Reform Act (ECRA), smuggling, and multiple counts of money laundering related to the $3.4–$4 million in wire transfers.Raymond faces seven money laundering counts and additional ECRA violations; Ho faces nine money laundering counts, four ECRA violations, and three smuggling counts.Chen and Li face conspiracy, ECRA violations, and smuggling charges. All four could face up to 20 years in prison if convicted.The case has renewed calls from US lawmakers for stricter chip-tracking legislation.John Moolenaar, chair of the House Select Committee on China, stressed the need for the bipartisan Chip Security Act, which would mandate chip location verification and reporting of potential diversions.“China recognises the superiority of American AI innovation and will do whatever it must to catch up. That’s why the bipartisan Chip Security Act is urgently needed,” he said, as per Reuters.The indictment underlines the strategic importance of AI and supercomputing chips, which US export curbs aim to prevent from aiding China’s military and technological advancements.The justice department noted that China is actively developing exascale supercomputing capabilities and plans to become a global AI leader by 2030.","The indictment, unsealed Thursday in US district court in Tampa, Florida, accuses two US citizens and two Chinese nationals of conspiring to ship Nvidia GPUs without required licenses.

'They Love Us Again': Trump Hints At Trade Deal With India, Lowering Of Tariffs Amid Strain In Ties

Tariffs drag down port traffic



Forecasts turn bleak as demand weakens

The US transport and logistics industry is continuing to feel the strain of President Donald Trump’s tariff regime, with major ports reporting a steep fall in inbound cargo after months of record traffic.For the first time this year, October rates for van, flatbed and refrigerated loads declined on both monthly and annual terms, according to the DAT Truckload Volume Index.As per CNBC, Ken Adamo, DAT’s chief of analytics, said the third-quarter and October slowdown mirrored trends across the wider goods economy, with companies using up stockpiles created earlier to cushion tariff risks and softer demand.“As a result, the traditional peak holiday shipping season looks virtually non-existent this year,” he said.Van loads dropped 3% from September and 11% year on year, refrigerated freight dipped 2% and 7% respectively, while flatbed loads fell 4% month on month and 3% annually.Government data released after a lengthy shutdown showed that US imports in August fell by $18.4 billion compared with July as fresh tariffs took effect, contributing to the trade deficit shrinking by more than 23%, reported CNBC.The Port of Long Beach said Chinese imports to the US are down 16%, with CEO Mario Cordero calling the decline “across the board.”Neighbouring Los Angeles also recorded weaker volumes in October.Sectors hit hardest include electronics, furniture and toys, while US grain exports have suffered as China shifted soybean purchases to Brazil during the trade dispute.Though China later agreed to buy more US soybeans, earlier frontloading by retailers and manufacturers—done to avoid shifting tariff deadlines—had already inflated West Coast container numbers earlier in the year.Despite overall West Coast volumes still showing a year-on-year rise of 10% and China–West Coast shipments increasing 4.6%, Vizion data shows a darker outlook.The firm’s vice president, Ben Tracy, expects US imports in December to fall 16.6% year on year after a 12% drop in the third quarter. “There is no bounce back in sight,” he said, as quoted by CNBC.Vizion CEO Kyle Henderson added that import levels have consistently slipped below 2 million TEUs for the first time since March 2023, calling it a “structural goods recession” driven by tariff uncertainty, a stalled housing market and consumers shifting away from physical goods.“When furniture imports collapse 33 percent and toy imports … barely rise 17 percent that tells you retailers are betting on the weakest consumer season in years,” he said.Container utilisation has also slid from 100% to 91%.Arrivals scheduled for December stand at 2.19 million TEUs, down from 2.62 million the previous year—a reduction of over 430,000 TEUs that is now filtering through rail, trucking, warehousing and port labour.Cordero said the slowdown was already raising concerns among longshore workers. “When you have reduced volume, you’re going to have an impact on the jobs in the supply chain,” he said.The International Longshoremen’s Association, which receives yearly bonuses tied to volumes moved, is among those affected.Tariffs on India have severely weakened the freight market on that route, with the Global Trade Research Initiative estimating a 37.5% drop in Indian export value to the US from May to September 2025, with Indian goods now facing a 50% tariff.","Major ports report steep fall in inbound cargo after months of record traffic.

China 'Schools' Trump's Treasury Chief On Rare Earths Leverage Claims | 'Threats Won't Solve...'

Greenland becomes a focal point

Race extends to Arctic Sweden

A worldwide rush to tap the Arctic’s resources is accelerating as countries look for alternatives to China’s stronghold over strategic minerals.Melting ice and improving access have drawn renewed interest to the largely undeveloped polar region, which is increasingly viewed as a potential source of rare earths, base metals and new trade routes, as per CNBC.US President Donald Trump has repeatedly highlighted the strategic value of Greenland, describing U.S. control of the territory as an “absolute necessity” for both economic and security reasons.Canada has also stepped up investment in the region amid strained ties with Washington, while Moscow continues to position itself as a major Arctic power. Russian President Vladimir Putin recently praised the launch of a new nuclear-powered icebreaker, saying it remains important “to consistently strengthen Russia’s position” in the Arctic.Marc Lanteigne of the Arctic University of Norway was quoted by CNBC as saying that the region is now being seen as a source of “strategic materials and rare earths,” noting that Greenland contains “base metals, precious metals, gem stones, rare earths, uranium … it’s all there.”As per CNBC, climate change has reshaped parts of Greenland, exposing areas previously covered by ice. A study by the University of Leeds found some of the island’s glaciers and ice sheet have given way to wetlands, shrubs and bare rock, making certain minerals more accessible to companies.Tony Sage, CEO of Critical Metals, was cited by CNBC as saying that he had seen rising investor interest in Greenland, particularly since Trump returned to office. The firm is developing large rare earth assets in the south of the island.Another firm, Amaroq, has also reported major discoveries. CEO Eldur Olafsson described the company’s recent find of high-grade rare earths as significant and said its confirmation of commercial quantities of germanium and gallium could be even more important. “The germanium, gallium piece is, in my opinion, much bigger news than people understand,” he said, according to CNBC.Both metals are used extensively in electronics, electric vehicles and defence technologies. China imposed export controls on these metals in 2023 before later suspending its ban on shipments to the US, though restrictions remain.Olafsson said Amaroq’s near-term plan involves generating cashflow from zinc, lead, silver and germanium and gallium, while progressing its rare earths projects. He added that the rare earths market remains relatively small and must be approached cautiously.Despite the growing excitement, Lanteigne said that expectations often exceed reality.Even under favourable conditions, he said it could take 15 to 20 years for Arctic mining ventures in places like Greenland to turn a “serious profit,” citing logistical issues, harsh weather and the need to construct entire supply chains in remote areas.Interest is not limited to Greenland. Sweden is moving to develop one of Europe’s largest known rare earth deposits in the Per Geijer area near Kiruna.State-owned LKAB, which operates a major iron ore mine there, is now in discussions with European policymakers to ensure the project is viable.Niklas Johansson of LKAB said that while key materials have already been extracted to the surface through existing mining operations, profitability is not guaranteed.“It looks like it is for us at the moment, but it’s not something that you’d say, ‘oh it’s a no brainer,’” he said, noting the challenges would be even greater for companies without established infrastructure.","Melting ice and improving access have drawn renewed interest to the largely undeveloped polar region.

Donald Trump Signals Harsh Sanctions On Russia’s Trading Partners With India On List For Oil Trade

The Congressional Budget Office has lowered its projection of how much President Donald Trump’s tariff increases will reduce US budget deficits over the next decade.The non-partisan agency now expects the duties to cut deficits by $3 trillion through 2035, down from the $4 trillion estimated in August, as per news agency Reuters.According to the latest assessment, all tariffs imposed between January 6 and November 15 would reduce primary deficits by $2.5 trillion if maintained until 2035.Lower government borrowing would save an additional $500 billion in interest payments. The CBO said the revision was largely the result of newly available data, with the rest reflecting recent tariff adjustments by the administration.CBO director Philip Swagel said “roughly two-thirds of the downward revisions” were due to updated figures, while changes to tariff rates since August also affected the outlook, reported Bloomberg.Some US courts have ruled the administration exceeded its authority in imposing the duties, with the Supreme Court now reviewing those decisions. Critics have argued that tariff costs are ultimately borne by consumers, while Trump has maintained the measures have created a financial gain for the Treasury.As per Bloomberg, the CBO’s new projection means expected tariff revenue would not fully offset the government’s earlier assessment that Trump’s tax-cut law would add $3.4 trillion to deficits over 10 years.The agency also said it now estimates the effective tariff rate to be around 14 percentage points above last year’s level, compared with an 18-point rise estimated in August.The adjustment follows a series of trade deals and rate reductions intended to curb price increases on certain goods.As per Axios, the revised projection returns the CBO’s estimate to its June level, after it had been raised in August. Axios also reported that more than a third of US imports are now unaffected by tariff changes introduced this year.The White House, in a statement cited by Axios, said the tariffs would generate “trillions in revenue,” claiming foreign exporters would bear the costs.Trump has continued to promote the idea of $2,000 “tariff dividend” cheques, although many lawmakers prefer using the revenue to narrow deficits.Any ruling by the Supreme Court against key tariff actions would alter revenue expectations, though economists expect the administration would attempt to reintroduce the duties through other means, as per Bloomberg.","The Congressional Budget Office has lowered its projection of how much President Donald Trump’s tariff increases will reduce US budget deficits over the next decade.

Japan stimulus push: Cabinet approves $135.4 billion package,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/japan-stimulus-push-cabinet-approves-135-4-billion-package-heres-what-it-includes/articleshow/125477853.cms,"File photo: Japan's Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi (Picture credit: ANI)

Japan has moved ahead with a sweeping ¥21.3 trillion ($135 billion) stimulus push, the first major policy step under Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi.Her cabinet signed off on the plan on Friday, with the measures aimed at easing the pressure of rising prices on families and businesses.The approval marks the biggest stimulus since the Covid pandemic and reflects Takaichi’s promise to run an expansionary fiscal agenda, as per Reuters.The core of the package includes ¥17.7 trillion in general account spending, well above last year’s ¥13.9 trillion, along with ¥2.7 trillion in tax cuts.Local reports cited by news agency AFP said the bundle also features energy support for households.he government is expected to rely on higher tax revenues from inflation and a fresh round of bond issuance, which, according to Reuters, could exceed the ¥6.69 trillion issued for last year’s plan.A supplementary budget is due to be approved as early as 28 November, with the aim of getting parliament’s sign-off by year-end.Markets have reacted nervously to the plan’s scale. The yen has dropped to its weakest level in ten months, while long-term government bond yields touched record highs.Finance minister Satsuki Katayama hinted strongly at possible intervention, saying Tokyo would take “appropriate action against disorderly (foreign exchange) moves,” AFP reported.Analysts quoted by AFP warned that a further slide in the currency would deepen the strain on households reliant on imported food, fuel and raw materials.Takaichi has defended her approach, stressing earlier this week that her goal is to pursue a “responsible and proactive fiscal policy” and keep living costs in check.Official data showed core inflation rising to 3% in October, up from 2.9% in September, with rice about 40% costlier than this time last year, according to AFP.The package also comes after the economy shrank 0.4% in the third quarter, marking Japan’s first contraction since early 2024.Alongside economic concerns, Tokyo faces rising diplomatic tensions with Beijing. China summoned Japan’s ambassador after Takaichi suggested Japan could respond militarily if Taiwan were attacked.Media reports said Beijing is preparing to halt Japanese seafood imports, though neither side has confirmed it.Takaichi, who took office last month, has argued that heavy spending is necessary to reduce the burden on households and spur investment in fields like AI, chips and shipbuilding.","Japan moves ahead with sweeping ¥21.3 trillion ($135 billion) stimulus push.

NEW DELHI: More than 1.14 lakh startups in India have created over 12 lakh jobs so far, the finance ministry said in its latest review of the Indian economy.In the report titled, ‘The Indian Economy: A Review January 2024’, the Department of Economic Affairs said that the 1.14 lakh startups recognised by the government under the 'Startup India initiative’ created more than 12 lakh jobs (as of October 2023).The state-owned e-commerce platform Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) clocked more than 63 lakh transactions till November 2023, the document read.Despite facing global challenges in 2023 like valuation issues, few IPOs, regulatory changes and macroeconomic and geopolitical trends, India remains the third largest tech start-up ecosystem globally, with over 950 tech startups founded last year.The cumulative funding for more than 31,000 tech start ups has exceeded $70 billion (from 2019 to 2023), according to a recent report by Nasscom in collaboration with Zinnov.“In 2023, despite facing global economic and regulatory challenges, Indian tech startups have prioritised the imperative of enhancing their business fundamentals, driving profitability and growth,” said Debjani Ghosh, President, Nasscom.“The proliferation of tech startups in tier 2 and 3 cities marks the ecosystem's resilience,” she added.Navigating 2024, tech startup founders expect to continue the revenue growth path with measured steps focusing on optimising expenditure and maximising profitability for B2B tech startups.Investments in deeptech will continue an upward trend in 2024. With generative AI (GenAI) acceleration, 70 per cent of start-up founders are embedding artificial intelligence (AI) in their solutions.As funding becomes scarce for the Indian startup ecosystem in general, the explosion of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has given a new lease of life to entrepreneurs and founders in the country, as the Centre extends support to the sector.","The state-owned e-commerce platform Open Network for Digital Commerce clocked more than 63 lakh transactions till November 2023.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September.

Space sector start-up Sisir Radar to develop SAR on L/P band SAR,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/space-sector-start-up-sisir-radar-to-develop-sar-on-l/p-band-sar/articleshow/104558111.cms,"CHENNAI: Space sector startup, Sisir Radar Private Ltd has hit success at the prestigious iDEX DefSpace Challenge with its projects for development of “L/P band Continuous Wave SAR (synthetic aperture radar) payload for LEO Small Satellites” and “Unfurlable, Electronically Steering Antenna for L/P band SAR payload” for Indian Air Force (IAF), said a top company official.The company is promoted by former Director at the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) Tapan Misra and the brains behind the Indian space agency’s RISAT series of SAR satellites as well as the Dual Frequency SAR on the Chandrayaan 2 orbiter that is currently circling the moon.""A grant of Rs 3 crore is also there for development of the products,"" Misra told IANS.Synthetic Aperture Radar or SAR is a special kind of imaging radar technology that can provide extremely accurate high resolution imagery of the terrain through clouds, smoke and dust even in pitch dark conditions. SAR imagery provides much higher resolution than other forms of remote sensing technology such as hyperspectral and multispectral. SAR is a critical technology for strategic reconnaissance and planning as well as for disaster management.According to Misra, winning the challenge in just over a year of floating the company is a major booster.He said L and P band SAR have an advantage over other frequencies (like X band) when it comes to penetration capabilities through rain, clouds, foliage and vegetation in a tropical country like India, and underground penetration capabilities in dry terrain.Continuing further, he said the L band SAR will provide 1 metre resolution, spotlight resolution in Stripmap mode. The current industry standard is 5-10 metre in L band. Misra said both the L and P band will operate simultaneously from a satellite borne SAR. Recently, Sisir Radar successfully developed and tested the world’s highest resolution L-Band SAR fitted on a drone. With 0.2 metre resolution, this is by far the highest L band SAR in the world, he said.","Space sector startup, Sisir Radar Private Ltd has hit success at the prestigious iDEX DefSpace Challenge.

Explainer: What is 'Hindu rate of growth' and why Raghuram Rajan's remarks may be 'premature',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/explainer-what-is-hindu-rate-of-growth-and-why-raghuram-rajans-remarks-may-be-premature/articleshow/98482598.cms,"What is meant by Hindu growth rate

How India's GDP has been growing

What SBI report said on savings and investment

Incremental capital output ratio

NEW DELHI: India's gross domestic product (GDP) data for the third quarter (October-December 2022) received a word of caution from the former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan In an interview with news agency PTI, Rajan that India is ""dangerously close"" to the Hindu rate of growth in view of subdued private sector investment, high interest rates and slowing global growth.India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying"".However, a report released by the State Bank of India (SBI) economists on Tuesday dismissed arguments that India is dangerously close to Hindu rate of growth saying such statements are ""ill-conceived, biased and premature"".The term 'Hindu growth rate' was coined by late economist Raj Krishna in 1978 to describe the slow growth in the country.It basically refers to the low pace of economic growth rates during 1950s to 1980s. During this period, the Indian economy averaged 3.5%.A former lecturer at the Delhi School of Economics (DSE), Krishna noted that only if the rate of growth is persistently slow and accompanied by low per-capita GDP, then it will be known as Hindu rate of growth but it has to factor in population growth as well.Before economic reforms of 1991, India's economic growth remained stagnant and low, while per capita income averaged around 1.3%.Krishna termed this low growth situation to be a result of socialist policies of state control and import substitution.However, the economic situation changed when liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation (LPG) reforms came into effect in the year 1991, at a time when India faced balance of payment crisis.Over the years, many economists have strongly opposed the idea of 'Hindu growth rate' and the term never had universal acceptance.The Indian economy plunged into its very first technical recession in FY21 due to the impact of Covid-19 pandemic and the related nationwide lockdowns. GDP shrunk by an unprecedented 23.8% in the first quarter of the financial year 2020-21. However, due to spurt in economic activities in the subsequent quarters, the GDP decline started to narrow.However, if we look at the period before Covid-19 as well, India's growth curve shows a declining trend.From 8.26% in FY17, GDP growth plunged to 3.74% in FY20. Shutdown of economic activities in FY21 in wake of Covid-19 only made matters worse.As lockdowns started to ease and business activities resumed, India's GDP also started rising. In Q1 of FY22, growth jumped to 20.1% mainly on account of low base effect. By the fourth quarter of FY22, growth came down to 4.10%.Similarly, the new financial year 2022-23 brought fresh economic challenges in the form of Russia-Ukraine war that impacted almost all major economies of the world, slowed the pace of growth, pushed inflation to record highs.As a result, the central banks of all advanced economies spurred into action and opted for monetary policy tightening to curb the soaring inflation.With persistently rising interest rates, India's economy grew by 4.4% in Q3 of FY23, as the Centre revised upwards GDP growth for previous year to 9.10% from 8.7% earlier.The report weighed recent GDP numbers against the available data on savings and investments for the past decade and highlighted some interesting points.""Quarterly growth numbers are noisy and should be best avoided for any serious interpretation (on an average, India's GDP growth has witnessed Rs 2 lakh crore upward revision for the 3 year ended FY23),"" the report said.Gross capital formation (GCF) by the government touched a high of 11.8% in 2021-22, up from 10.7% in 2020-21.""This also had a domino effect on private sector investment that jumped from 10 per cent to 10.8% over the same period,"" it said.In fact, Ecowrap added that the trends in GCF to gross output ratio or the plough back of funds for creation of fresh capacity shows that for public administration the ratio attained fresh peak in 2021-22 owing to the emphasis on capital expenditure in recent budgets.At the aggregate level, gross capital formation is supposed to have crossed 32% in 2022-23, the highest level since 2018-19.According to the report, in 2021-22, gross savings have risen to 30% from 29% in 2020-21.""The ratio is supposed to have crossed 31 per cent in 2022-23, the highest since 2018-19. The household savings increased sharply during the pandemic period on account of sharp accretion in financial savings such as deposits,"" said the report by SBI's Economic Research Department.While household financial savings have since then moderated from 15.4% in 2020-21 to 11.1% in 2022-23, savings in physical assets have grown sharply to 11.8% in 2021-22 from 10.7% in 2020-21.The report further analysed Incremental Capital Output ratio (ICOR) -- which measures additional units of capital (investment) needed to produce additional units of output. It said that the ratio has been improving.""ICOR which was 7.5 in FY 12 is now only 3.5 in FY22. Clearly, only half of capital is now needed for next unit of output,"" the report noted.Such reducing ICOR in the current years reflects a relatively increasing efficiency of capital and shows that the economy is on a sound footing, the report said.""From that point of view, future GDP growth rates even at 7% could still mean a decent number by any standards!,"" it added.","India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%. Raghuram Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying""","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-98483158,imgsize-65724,width-400,resizemode-4/98483158.jpg"

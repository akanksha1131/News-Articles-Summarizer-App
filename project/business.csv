Fallout of rupee breaching 90 mark: Get ready to pay higher for consumer goods; here’s what may become costlier,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/fallout-of-rupee-breaching-90-mark-get-ready-to-pay-higher-for-consumer-goods-heres-what-may-become-costlier/articleshow/125759521.cms,"Manufacturers of smartphones, laptops, televisions and major appliances have indicated plans to hike prices.

Priyanka Gandhi Slams Modi Govt On Rupee Crash While Piyush Goyal Defends India’s Economic Strength

Rupee hits new low: Will prices rise?

Currency push

Consumers may soon have to brace for higher prices! The depreciation of the rupee beyond Rs 90 against the US dollar could force various sectors including consumer electronics, beauty products, and automobile manufacturers to increase their prices. This increase may end up eating into the benefits after the recent GST rate cuts. This potential price rise might neutralise the positive sales momentum these sectors saw after recent tax reductions.Companies dependent on imported components or complete imported products are seeing concerns. Several companies had postponed their price increase plans, despite escalating raw material costs, due to potential government oversight following the GST reductions effective September 22.Manufacturers of smartphones, laptops, televisions and major appliances have indicated plans to hike prices by around 3-7% starting December-January, according to an ET report.The price hikes aim to compensate for increased costs of memory chips, copper and additional components resulting from rupee depreciation. The imported materials constitute between 30-70% of manufacturing expenses across these product categories.""The advantages of reduced GST rates will be nullified by currency devaluation and increasing component costs,"" said Avneet Singh Marwah, chief executive at Super Plastronics, which manufactures Kodak, Thomson and Blaupunkt TVs.""Memory chip prices have increased more than six times in the past four months. We anticipate demand might decline again after the brief recovery from the GST reduction,"" said Marwah according to the ET report.Also Read | Rs 90 to a dollar: What’s driving the fall and why it matters to you - explained Industry leaders noted they had calculated costs expecting the rupee to remain at 85-86 against the dollar, but its sharp fall to Rs 90 necessitates new calculations. Several firms had postponed regular price adjustments since October despite rising material costs, wary of being accused of profiteering after GST implementation.Presently, firms have begun notifying retailers about forthcoming price increases. Havells has indicated a 3% increase in LED TV prices, whilst Super Plastronics plans 7-10% higher prices, and Godrej Appliances will raise prices by 5-7% for air-conditioners and refrigerators from January.They indicated that a single-level change in energy efficiency ratings from January will create additional challenges. ""The stricter energy rating requirements and weakening rupee necessitate price adjustments from January. Should the rupee weaken further, additional increases may be needed in the March quarter,"" said Kamal Nandi, business head at Godrej Appliances. ""The GST reduction benefits will be completely negated, but we have no alternative. ""Consumer goods manufacturers have privately informed government officials that they cannot continue to absorb rising costs.The rapidly expanding beauty market in India, with international brands like Shiseido, MAC, Bobbi Brown, Clinique and The Body Shop, faces potential challenges due to rising import costs. Furthermore, the GST on cosmetics remains at 18%, with no provisions to offset currency-related cost increases.Also Read | ‘Not losing sleep’: CEA Nageswaran on rupee touching 90 mark versus US dollar; ‘falling rupee is not affecting…’ ""A weaker rupee does increase our landed cost since a significant share of beauty products across fragrances, cosmetics and skincare are imported and dollar-denominated,"" said Biju Kassim, chief executive at Shoppers Stop Beauty. ""For distributors like Global SS Beauty, this creates margin pressure that becomes hard to sustain long-term unless partially offset. We work closely with our global brand partners to optimise costs and hedge currency exposure, but some price correction on high-end imported portfolios may eventually be unavoidable. ""The declining value of the rupee poses risks to the recent positive trend in vehicle sales, following price reductions implemented by companies on two-wheelers and cars after GST reduction benefits.Mercedes-Benz India's managing director Santosh Iyer stated, ""We estimate the positive effect of the price drop on demand for luxury vehicles to gradually wean away in the mid- to long-term, as prices of luxury cars will rise from current levels owing to deteriorating forex movement. We are mulling a price correction from January 26.""The competitor Audi India is currently evaluating its position in the market.Audi India's head Balbir Singh Dhillon commented, ""The rupee depreciation impacts the company directly and fully, but as of now, the company has not decided on the price increase or its quantum.""The government's decision to reduce GST on compact automobiles and two-wheelers from 28-31% to 18% resulted in actual price reductions of 8.5-9.9%. This led to increased sales of 17% and 19% in October and November respectively, following a sluggish first half of the financial year. However, the current currency fluctuations might neutralise this surge in demand.","The depreciation of the rupee beyond Rs 90 against the US dollar could force various sectors including consumer electronics, beauty products, and automobile manufacturers to increase their prices.

Benchmark indices spent the previous week oscillating within a defined consolidation band, digesting their recent up move. The Nifty registered a fresh lifetime peak of 26,325 during Monday’s trade. However, lost momentum at elevated levels amid bouts of profit-taking, triggered in part by renewed pressure on the Indian rupee, which depreciated to a record low against the US dollar. Persistent foreign portfolio outflows (FPI selling) further exacerbated currency weakness, injecting a note of caution into risk sentiment.In the near term, market trajectory is likely to be dictated by currency stabilization dynamics, especially whether the rupee can find a durable floor. Additionally, investors will be closely tracking the RBI’s upcoming monetary policy statement for cues on the central bank’s stance regarding inflation management, liquidity calibration, and potential interventions to support the rupee. On the global front, the US FOMC policy outcome will remain a critical macro catalyst, shaping expectations around global rate differentials and capital flows. Moreover, clarity on evolving India–US trade negotiations could influence sector-specific outlooks, particularly in export-linked and tariff-sensitive industries.A key observation on the Nifty daily chart is that the entire up-move over the past two months has remained well within a rising channel, indicating sustained buying interest at higher levels and reinforcing an overall positive bias.We believe the current 3-4 sessions breather should be used to accumulate quality stocks in a staggered manner for the next leg of up move towards 26,500 and then towards 26,800 in the coming weeks being the measuring implication of the recent range breakout and the upper band of the last two months rising channel.Nifty has key support in the range of 25700-25900 being the confluence of the 50-day EMA, the bullish gap from November 12 and the lower band of the rising channel of the last two months. Holding above the support area will keep the overall bias positive and only a breakdown below the support area will signal a pause in the current positive trend.Bank Nifty traded in a range, digesting its last four weeks strong gains. Earlier during the week, it formed a fresh all-time high of 26114. However, profit booking at higher levels saw the index traded in a range ahead of the RBI monetary policy outcome.We expect the index to consolidate and form a base in the range of 58500-60100 in the coming sessions.A follow through strength above Monday’s high (60114) will open further upside towards 60,400 and then towards 61,000 levels in the coming weeks.The entire up move of the last 2 months is well channelled signaling sustained demand at elevated levels. Key support is placed at 58,300-58,600 levels being the confluence of the last two weeks lows and recent breakout area. Holding above the support area will keep the short-term bias positive.The stock is forming base at the 52 week EMA and the 61.8% retracement of the previous major up move (940-1314).We believe the current decline is approaching price and time wise maturity and the stock is likely to resume up move and head towards 1190 levels being the confluence of the high of November and key retracement area.The daily stochastic has approached extreme oversold territory and we expect the stock to resume its positive momentum in the coming weeks.Tata Power continues to trade sideways on the daily timeframe, oscillating within a well-defined range of ₹380–₹420. The stock is currently forming a rectangle pattern, with consistent buying support emerging near the ₹380 zone.Historically, the counter has shown a tendency to rebound from these lower levels and head towards the upper end of the range, which lies near ₹420.Given the prevailing price structure and renewed momentum, the stock appears poised to extend its upward trajectory, first towards the upper band of ₹420, and potentially up to ₹430, which aligns with the 127.2% Fibonacci extension of the previous swing.","Nifty registered a fresh lifetime peak of 26,325 during Monday’s trade.

Payrolls firm ADP reported that over 30,000 jobs were lost in November, reinforcing signs that the US labour market is softening.Thursday’s figures on jobless claims and layoffs were slightly better than expected, yet markets remain highly confident of a rate cut at the Fed’s Wednesday meeting, with probabilities hovering around 90%.All eyes are now on the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index, the Fed’s preferred inflation measure, due later on Friday.Analysts expect that a below-forecast reading could strengthen hopes for additional rate reductions in 2026. Data on income and consumer spending is also set for release.Wall Street ended the session on a muted note, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq posting small gains, while the Dow slipped marginally.Back in Asia, the focus will be on RBI's monetary policy announcement, whre the apex bank might announce a rate cut.

Morgan Stanley has an overweight rating on JSW Steel with the target price at Rs 1,300. Analysts said that along with JFE's technological expertise, JSW is looking to leverage its project execution capabilities to participate in multi-decade growth opportunities. Under a new pact between JFE and JSW, JFE will invest about Rs 15,800 crore in two tranches for a 50% stake in a new entity BPSL), implying Rs 31,500 crore equity value for the new entity. JSW Steel will receive Rs 24,500 crore in cash for slump sale of its stake. JSW will also get Rs 7,900 crore through equity dilution on back of a share swap agreement with the promoter company that owns 17% of BPSL.HSBC has initiated its coverage of Tata Consumer Products with the target price at Rs 1,340. Analysts believe that the Tata Group’s flagship food & beverages company has a scope to expand and deepen distribution to drive growth. They forecast a 26% FY25-FY28 compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) for its growth portfolio, contributing 37% of the India revenue in FY28, from 28% in FY25. Analysts assigned premium 55x price-to-earnings multiple as they believe aggressive acquisitions and distribution will pay off.Motilal Oswal Securities has a buy on Aurobindo Pharma with the target price at Rs 1,430. Analysts said that the company’s broad-based growth momentum is building up. The company’s domestic Pen-G/6-APA manufacturing is positioned for healthy upside. Also, biosimilars, biologics CMO, and EU expansion drive diversification beyond legacy.CLSA has a hold on Kotak Mahindra Bank with the target price at Rs 2,350. Analysts raised the possibility of Kotak Bank buying IDBI Bank which the govt had said will divest. They feel such a deal would be earnings per share (EPS) accretive for the private sector lender, but may or may not address the excess capital issue and could possibly raise some HR issues. Analysts said IDBI Bank has a clean balance sheet, and a good deposit franchise. The value accretion for Kotak Bank would depend on how the purchase would be funded.Jefferies has an underperform rating on Dr Reddy’s Labs with the target price at Rs 1,130. Analysts met some top officials of the company. They said that the company remains confident of first wave launches in Canada, India and other emerging markets including in Brazil. The US FDA filing for biosimilar Abatacept, Dr Reddy's biggest asset, is on track this month with approval expected in 12-months.

NEW DELHI: Sberbank, Russia’s largest lender, is looking to ramp up its operations in the country, opening up to 10 branches, investing surplus rupees from bilateral currency trade in Indian govt bonds and getting Russian investors to park funds in Nifty stocks.“We have a full banking licence here... we will expand our business in a step-by-step manner over three years. We will ramp up B2B business and enter into the B2C segment,” the bank’s CEO & chairman of the executive board Herman Gref told reporters here.Russian retail and institutional customers can invest in govt securities and the bank is also planning a product to finance gold imports from India. The interest goes beyond banking as talks have been initiated with a local partner to enter into the education space, with engineering schools. Besides, Gref said that the bank is working with Russian and Indian companies to expand the scope of bilateral trade by getting more exports to Russia, which is limited to traditional goods. This will also help address the issue of surplus Indian rupees.Gref said that nearly 80-85% of the payments for India’s exports are routed through Sberbank, while 10-15% of the imports are linked with the lender that saw a 14 times jump in transactions after the outbreak of the conflict with Ukraine, which resulted in a massive increase in import of oil as govt sought to take advantage of the hefty discounts.The banker said that it was important to develop hedging tools and Sberbank was working with an exchange in Dubai to ensure better price discovery of the bilateral currency trade. Currently, he said some of the payments are settled using a third country.“We have requested the central bank here to grant 10 branch licences for opening offices,” he said, adding that the lender has two branches and an IT unit in Bengaluru. Another tech centre is planned in Hyderabad and the headcount in India will increase from the current level of 900 employees.","Sberbank, Russia’s largest lender, is looking to ramp up its operations in the country.

Banks lost long-term value in foreign stake sales: Kotak CEO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/banks-lost-long-term-value-in-foreign-stake-sales-kotak-ceo/articleshow/125778158.cms,"Ashok Vaswani, MD & CEO, Kotak Mahindra Bank

MUMBAI: Kotak Bank chief executive Ashok Vaswani said large banks that sold stakes in their financial-services subsidiaries to foreign investors lost considerable long-term value, arguing that full ownership of such businesses is a strategic advantage.Speaking at a media gathering on Wed, Vaswani urged reporters to “go and do a bit of history” on how big banking groups monetised their subsidiaries in earlier years. “Every time a big group sold some part of their stuff, usually they sold it to a foreigner. And then how much money the foreigner has made at the cost of the group,” he said, adding that the arithmetic makes for “a very interesting maths.” Many Indian banks had sold stakes in their mutual funds, insurance and securities arm to monetise their investments and these businesses have grown significantly.Vaswani said Kotak’s approach of retaining full ownership across its 19 financial-services subsidiaries has helped build long-term embedded value. “Kotak is the single broadest financial conglomerate in India. There’s nobody else like Kotak. We manufacture every single financial-services product there is and we own all those subsidiaries 100%,” he said.He also highlighted cross-selling across business lines, particularly institutional banking. “It is so beautiful to see when somebody like Hyundai or LG comes to do an IPO — the corporate banker introduces the investment bank, research does a paper on them, the treasury does the FX, the consumer bank picks up the balances. We cater to the customer across,” he said, adding that bank’s strategy over the past two years has centred on customer focus.","Kotak Bank chief executive Ashok Vaswani said large banks that sold stakes in their financial-services subsidiaries to foreign investors lost considerable long-term value.

Five years to 18 months — is the US slashing immigrant work authorization? Here's what new USCIS work permit rules say,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/five-years-to-18-months-is-the-us-slashing-immigrant-work-authorization-heres-what-new-uscis-work-permit-rules-say/articleshow/125778167.cms,"Vetting and screening of non-citizens will be increased: USCIS

The Trump administration has once again introduced new changes, making its immigration policy more restrictive.On Thursday, US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) updated its Policy Manual to sharply limit the length of Employment Authorization Documents (EADs) for several categories of immigrants, including refugees, asylum seekers, and applicants awaiting adjustment of status.Under the new policy, the maximum duration for initial and renewal work permits will drop from five years to 18 months for refugees, people granted asylum, those with withholding of removal, and applicants with pending cases for asylum, adjustment of status or other humanitarian relief, as per press release.The change applies to employment authorization applications filed or pending on or after December 5, 2025.USCIS said the shift is intended to increase the frequency of vetting and screening for noncitizens seeking authorization to work in the United States as part of a broader immigration enforcement push.“Reducing the maximum validity period for employment authorization will ensure that those seeking to work in the United States do not threaten public safety or promote harmful anti-American ideologies,"" Director Joseph Edlow said.He also pointed out the recent attack on National Guard and said that such incidents made vetting necessary so that the government can stop ""aliens.""After the attack on National Guard service members in our nation’s capital by an alien who was admitted into this country by the previous administration, it’s even more clear that USCIS must conduct frequent vetting of aliens,"" Edlow added.Separately, recent requirements in the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” signed into law July 4, 2025, will cap work authorization at one year — or the end of an individual’s parole or Temporary Protected Status (TPS) period, whichever is shorter — for immigrants paroled as refugees, those granted or applying for TPS, other parolees, and spouses of entrepreneur parole recipients. Those limits apply to any work permit applications filed or pending on or after July 22, 2025, when USCIS published a notice in the Federal Register outlining implementation.","US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) updated its Policy Manual to sharply limit the length of Employment Authorization Documents (EADs) for several categories of immigrants.

'Do Not UNDERESTIMATE Russia': Jeffrey Sachs Big Message To 'DELUSIONAL' U.S. & Trump

The United States has temporarily lifted some restrictions on Lukoil-branded fuel stations operating outside Russia, allowing them to continue running despite sanctions placed on the parent company.The treasury department confirmed on Thursday that these stations — including those in the US — can keep serving customers without enabling revenue to move back to Russia, which remains under extensive American and European sanctions over its actions in Ukraine.The exemption will stay in force until 29 April 2026, reported Reuters.The relaxation marks a partial suspension of measures introduced by US President Donald Trump in October.The announcement comes in the same week US officials met Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow as part of efforts to advance a Washington-backed plan to end the conflict.Lukoil’s footprint outside Russia is substantial. The company operates around 200 stations across New Jersey, Pennsylvania and New York.Its Finnish subsidiary Teboil, which runs roughly 430 fuel stations, has already begun winding down operations as supplies diminish, with expectations that Lukoil will eventually sell the chain.Beyond this, the firm remains a dominant retail player in Moldova and Bulgaria and manages about 600 outlets in Turkey and over 300 in Romania.The decision to soften restrictions comes against the backdrop of wider sanctions imposed by Washington.The US placed its first major penalties on Lukoil and Rosneft, freezing all American-based assets and banning US firms from engaging with them.Both companies — which together contribute around 55% of Russia’s petroleum output — were added to the Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) list.Businesses were given until 21 November to cut ties or risk secondary sanctions that could limit access to US banking, shipping and insurance services.India’s energy sector is also feeling the impact. New US sanctions on Rosneft and Lukoil have turned their crude into a “sanctioned molecule,” analysts said, as per PTI.Although India imported an average of 1.7 million barrels per day of Russian crude this year — with November expected to touch 1.8–1.9 million bpd — inflows are forecast to drop sharply to about 4,00,000 bpd in December and January.Several refiners, including Reliance Industries and HPCL-Mittal Energy, have paused purchases, with only Rosneft-backed Nayara Energy continuing supplies due to its dependence on Russian barrels.Experts say the restrictions apply specifically to designated companies, not to all Russian crude.This allows Indian buyers to legally source barrels from non-sanctioned producers such as Gazprom Neft or Surgutneftegaz, provided no blacklisted entity is involved in shipping, banking or trading.Reliance, which operates one of the world’s largest refining complexes, has already stopped using Russian crude in its export-oriented SEZ refinery to comply with upcoming EU rules.","The exemption will stay in force until 29 April 2026.

CNN reported that the acquisition follows an agreement reached in April, under which Prada committed to purchasing Versace for about $1.51 billion, a deal that materialised after Capri Holdings’ planned sale to Tapestry fell apart because of an antitrust challenge.Lorenzo Bertelli, the son of Prada founders Miuccia Prada and Patrizio Bertelli, is set to assume the role of executive chairman at Versace. Speaking about the extended discussions that paved the way for the deal, he said, ""There had already been contacts during the Covid period, and there were talks even before Capri's sale to Tapestry. When that deal fell through over antitrust issues, we came back and tried to speed things up. It was something that had been in the works for a long time.”With the acquisition now finalised, Versace — established in 1978 by Gianni Versace in Milan — becomes part of the group that owns both Prada and Miu Miu. Bertelli, who pushed for the acquisition, said the brand met two important criteria: it carried manageable financial risk and held strong global value.The transition comes shortly after Donatella Versace stepped aside as creative chief following 30 years in the position. She was succeeded by Dario Vitale, previously the design director at Miu Miu.","Lorenzo Bertelli, the son of Prada founders, is set to assume the role of executive chairman at Versace.

IndiGo Crisis: Inside Pilot Shortage, Rule Change and Winter Delays Behind Over 200 Cancellations

Airbus has been grappling with a fresh wave of setbacks, highlighting the mounting strain on its sprawling but fragile supply chain.The past week offered a stark reminder that the planemaker is not immune to the production troubles affecting the wider aviation industry, where supply shortages and labour gaps persist even years after the pandemic ended.Early Wednesday, the planemaker was forced to cut its long-standing aircraft delivery target for the year after discovering that a lesser-known Spanish supplier had provided out-of-specification aircraft panels, a blow that highlighted how vulnerable the €155-billion ($181-billion) manufacturer remains to disruptions among smaller vendors.Last Friday, Airbus issued an urgent directive for a software update across approximately 6,000 A320 aircraft, its flagship fleet, after identifying a potential fault in the interface between onboard computers and the flight-control system.Three days later, Airbus revealed a quality issue involving metal panels used in the fuselage of the same jet, triggering the need for detailed inspections of more than 600 aircraft already in service or at various stages of production.“The pressures of quarterly results, sometimes the pressures of competition, probably the quality drops a little bit,” Tony Fernandes, founder of AirAsia, was quoted as saying by Bloomberg.“It’s a good warning for everybody.”The one-two setback this week rattled investors, leading to Airbus’s worst trading day since April.The contrast was especially stark as Boeing, buoyed by a renewed optimism over its financial recovery, posted its strongest stock gains in months.On Tuesday, Boeing offered a series of upbeat forecasts, from increased deliveries of its 737 and 787 jets next year to a long-awaited return to positive cash flow after years of heavy outflows. Investors welcomed the outlook, sending the US plane maker's shares up by as much as 10 per cent, as cited by Bloomberg.Boeing has been slowly pulling itself out of a years-long crisis that began in late 2018 with the first of two fatal crashes, deepened during the Covid-19 pandemic, and worsened again in early 2024 when lapses in workmanship led to another near-disaster mid-flight.The situation was compounded further late last year, when a debilitating strike brought production to a standstill for weeks and drained the company’s resources.Since then, however, the storied US manufacturer has staged a steady comeback under new CEO Kelly Ortberg, who has overhauled management and set a sharper operational direction. Boeing has also benefited from strong backing from the White House, with the US president frequently leveraging aircraft orders in global negotiations and trade discussions.Airbus’ recent setbacks are still unlikely to reach the scale of Boeing’s turmoil last year. The company has already resolved the software issue over the weekend, minimising operational disruptions, and says most of the fuselage panels under inspection are expected to be compliant.However, the revised delivery timeline will leave some airlines waiting even longer for their aircraft, even as carriers rush to upgrade their fleets to keep pace with surging global travel demand.With China’s bid to challenge the long-standing duopoly still in its early stages, the fortunes of Airbus and Boeing remain tightly intertwined.Now, as Airbus targets a monthly production rate of 75 A320-family aircraft by 2027 and Boeing boosts output of its bestselling 737, both manufacturers face the same pressure: scaling up while preserving quality and ensuring that a fragile global supply chain can support their ambitions.","Airbus has been grappling with a fresh wave of setbacks, highlighting the mounting strain on its sprawling but fragile supply chain.

H-1B visa row: Trump admin orders enhanced vetting for applicants — what are the new requirements?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/h-1b-visa-row-trump-admin-orders-enhanced-vetting-for-applicants-what-are-the-new-requirements/articleshow/125756220.cms,"Donald Trump's Stricter H-1B Visa Rule Hits Indian Talent, Background Check Screening Expanded

How will this impact Indian techies?





Newsweek

The Trump administration announced on Wednesday that it had increased vetting of H-1B visa applicants for highly skilled workers, instructing that anyone involved in ""censorship"" of free speech should be considered for rejection, according to an internal State Department memo.H-1B visas allow US employers to hire foreign workers in specialty fields and are crucial for US tech companies, which recruit heavily from countries including India and China. Many of those companies’ leaders threw their support behind Trump in the last presidential election.The cable, sent to all US missions on December 2, ordered US consular officers to review resumes or LinkedIn profiles of H-1B applicants and family members travelling with them to see if they had worked in areas including misinformation, disinformation, content moderation, fact-checking, compliance and online safety.In a press release, the US department said that all the applicants need to change their profile setting from private to public.""As of December 15, the Department will expand the requirement that an online presence review be conducted for all H-1B applicants and their dependents, in addition to the students and exchange visitors already subject to this review. To facilitate this vetting, all applicants for H-1B and their dependents (H-4), F, M, and J nonimmigrant visas are instructed to adjust the privacy settings on all of their social media profiles to “public,"" the statement read.""If you uncover evidence an applicant was responsible for, or complicit in, censorship or attempted censorship of protected expression in the United States, you should pursue a finding that the applicant is ineligible,"" under a specific article of the Immigration and Nationality Act, the cable said.Details on the enhanced vetting for H-1B visas, including the focus on censorship and free speech, had not been previously reported. The State Dept did not respond to a request for comment on the contents of the cable.The cable said all visa applicants were subject to this policy but sought a heightened review for H-1B applicants given they frequently worked in the technology sector ""including in social media or financial services companies involved in the suppression of protected expression.""""You must thoroughly explore their employment histories to ensure no participation in such activities,"" the cable said.The new vetting requirements applied to both new and repeat applicants.The Trump administration made free speech, particularly what it saw as the stifling of conservative voices online, a focus of its foreign policy. Officials repeatedly weighed in on European politics to denounce what they said was suppression of right-wing politicians, including in Romania, Germany and France, accusing European authorities of censoring views like criticism of immigration in the name of countering disinformation.In May, Rubio threatened visa bans for people who censored speech by Americans, including on social media, and suggested the policy could target foreign officials regulating US tech companies.The Trump administration had already significantly tightened its vetting of applicants for student visas, ordering US consular officers to screen for any social media posts that might be hostile towards the United States.As part of his wide-ranging crackdown on immigration, Trump in September imposed new fees on H-1B visas.Trump and his Republican allies had repeatedly accused the administration of Democratic former President Joe Biden of encouraging suppression of free speech on online platforms, claims that had centred on efforts to stem false claims about vaccines and elections.The H-1B visa is relied on heavily by Indian tech professionals, meaning stricter US vetting rules will disproportionately affect Indian applicants. Under the Trump administration’s new policy, certain categories of Indian workers are now more vulnerable to delays, intensive questioning and potential denials — and, for the first time, even spouses and children will face expanded background checks. The change adds a new layer of uncertainty for thousands of Indian families in the US immigration pipeline.According to an analysis by the National Foundation for American Policy (NFAP) reported by, only three Indian firms ranked among the top 25 employers with approved H-1B petitions for initial employment in fiscal year 2025.The top seven Indian companies together secured just 4,573 H-1B approvals for initial employment in FY25 — a 70% drop from FY15 and a 37% decline compared to FY24. By contrast, US tech giants such as Amazon, Meta, Microsoft and Google dominated new approvals, highlighting the increasingly central role of American companies in sponsoring high-skilled foreign workers, the report said.","Trump administration has increased vetting of H-1B visa applicants for highly skilled workers.

‘Challenge to our system’: Malaysia cracks down on illegal Bitcoin mining; power theft losses reach $1.1 billion,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/challenge-to-our-system-malaysia-cracks-down-on-illegal-bitcoin-mining-power-theft-losses-reach-1-1-billion/articleshow/125757144.cms,"AP file photo

Malaysian authorities are stepping up their crackdown on illegal Bitcoin mining after uncovering nearly 14,000 illicit sites over the past five years and reporting about $1.1 billion in power-theft losses for state utility Tenaga Nasional (TNB).With cases rising sharply, including around 3,000 power-theft incidents linked to mining recorded by early October, the government last month launched a cross-agency taskforce involving the finance ministry, Bank Negara Malaysia, and TNB to coordinate action against rogue operators.Bitcoin mining in Malaysia is legal, provided operators obtain electricity legitimately and pay the required taxes. However, illegal miners use racks of high-powered “rigs” that perform trillions of calculations to validate transactions and earn coins, often tapping stolen electricity to keep their operations running.“Even if you run it properly, the challenge is that the market itself is very volatile,” Akmal Nasrullah Mohd Nasir, the deputy minister of energy transition and water transformation, quoted as saying by Bloomberg. “I don’t see any well-run mining that can be considered as successful legally.”Authorities are using a range of tactics to track illegal Bitcoin mining operations. Drones sweep over rows of shops and abandoned buildings, detecting unexpected heat signatures from machines that shouldn’t be running.On the ground, police deploy handheld sensors to identify irregular electricity use. At times, investigations rely on residents reporting unusual sounds, which have revealed miners masking the roar of their machinery with natural noises.Illegal operators are increasingly cautious, frequently moving between empty storefronts and deserted houses. They use heat shields to conceal the glow of their rigs and secure entrances with CCTV, heavy-duty locks, and broken-glass deterrents to prevent unauthorised access. Together, these measures illustrate the lengths both authorities and miners go to in the ongoing effort to enforce the law.“The risk of allowing such activities to happen is no longer about stealing,” said Akmal. “You can actually even break our facilities. It becomes a challenge to our system.”Globally, Bitcoin mining consumes more electricity than the entire countries of South Africa or Thailand. According to a report by the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance, over 75 per cent of mining activity now occurs in the United States. Malaysia’s share of the industry is less clear. In January 2022, the country accounted for 2.5 per cent of the global hashrate, a measure of computational power, but Cambridge has not published updated figures in its latest survey.Around 80 per cent of the country’s domestic electricity is generated from coal or natural gas. Across the region, fossil fuels continue to make up roughly three-quarters of the power mix, according to the International Energy Agency, as cited by DW.Last week, Malaysia’s Ministry of Energy Transition and Water announced the formation of a multi-agency committee to tackle the rising problem of electricity theft linked to cryptocurrency mining.","Malaysian authorities are stepping up their crackdown on illegal Bitcoin mining.

EU's €3 Billion Plan to End Dependence on China for Rare Earths,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/eu-rare-earth-push-brussels-rolls-out-3-bn-plan-to-slash-china-dependence-new-supply-hub-and-export-curbs-in-pipeline/articleshow/125748125.cms,"'Hostile...': Explosive Europe Vs China Standoff Over Rare Earths; Ursula Vows 'Retaliation' With G7

Squeezed between China and US

The European Union on Wednesday rolled out a multi-billion-euro strategy to reduce its dependence on China for rare earths, unveiling measures to boost domestic mining, refining and recycling capacity amid rising geopolitical pressure on critical supply chains.The plan comes after months of turbulence triggered by Beijing’s export controls, according to AFP, which have disrupted manufacturers in autos, electronics and defence and exposed the bloc’s vulnerability to raw-materials shocks.EU industry chief Stephane Sejourne said the bloc was “responding to the new global geopolitical reality” as the European Commission announced nearly €3 billion to support strategic projects both within the EU and in partner countries. He has previously likened China’s dominance to a rare-earths “racket”.A central feature of the new push is a European Centre for Critical Raw Materials, designed as a supply-hub modelled on Japan’s state-run JOGMEC. The centre will monitor demand, coordinate joint procurement for member states, and manage stockpiles and emergency deliveries to companies.Brussels also proposed curbing exports of scrap and waste from permanent magnets starting next year, to stimulate domestic recycling.Targeted restrictions on aluminium waste will follow, and copper could be added later.Despite adopting a critical raw-materials law two years ago, the bloc finds itself caught between Beijing’s tightening export regime and intensified US efforts under President Donald Trump to secure mineral access through bilateral deals.A new survey by the EU Chamber of Commerce in China found that 60% of European firms expect supply-chain disruptions due to Chinese government restrictions, while 13% fear they may need to halt or slow production.Updating its “economic security” doctrine the same day, the Commission said global trade tensions had made existing vulnerabilities sharper. “Trade is being weaponised. Supply chains are under pressure,” EU trade chief Maros Sefcovic said while presenting the plan.“Strategic choke points are turning economic dependency into political pressure, and this hits our companies every single day,” he added.The revised doctrine calls for more assertive use of tools such as foreign-investment screening, export controls and supplier diversification — and for developing new mechanisms where gaps persist.“Europe will continue to champion open trade,” Sefcovic said, “but our openness must be backed by security.”","EU industry chief Stephane Sejourne said the bloc was “responding to the new global geopolitical reality’ EU Commission announced nearly €3 billion to support strategic projects both within the EU and in partner countries.

EU says no to Russian gas: European Union aims to ban supply by 2027,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/eu-says-no-to-russian-gas-european-union-aims-to-ban-supply-by-2027-what-is-the-whole-plan/articleshow/125738538.cms,"Putin Wages War On Europe? DESTROYS EU Leaders For ‘Sabotaging’ Trump’s Peace Plan | Watch

What has EU planned?





Freezing Russian assets





The European Union has agreed on a timeline to completely halt Russian gas imports by autumn 2027, marking a significant escalation in efforts to curb Moscow’s energy revenues as the war in Ukraine approaches its fourth year.The agreement was reached during overnight talks between EU institutions and national governments, ending months of negotiations over how quickly the bloc should detach itself from Russian supplies. The result reflects middle ground between EU capitals and the European Parliament, which had pushed for a faster deadline.EU Energy Commissioner Dan Jorgensen hailed the breakthrough on X, writing, “We've made it: Europe is turning off the tap on Russian gas, forever,” adding, “We've chosen energy security and independence for Europe. No more blackmail. No more market manipulation by Putin. We stand strong with Ukraine.”According to the plan, no new long-term pipeline gas contracts with Russian suppliers will be permitted beyond September 30, 2027, as long as storage levels are considered sufficient, and not later than November 1, 2027.Long-term deals for liquefied natural gas (LNG) will stop even sooner, from January 1, 2027, in line with earlier calls from Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.Firstly, short-term arrangements will be ending. LNG contracts will cease from April 25, 2026 and pipeline gas contracts from June 17, 2026.In a statement, the European Council said the measure is designed “to end dependency on Russian energy following Russia's weaponisation of gas supplies with significant effects on the European energy market.” The package now awaits formal approval by both the European Parliament and EU member states.The deal provides a legal exit mechanism for companies already tied into Russian supply agreements, allowing them to cite “force majeure” as justification for terminating contracts once the ban applies.The same agreement instructs the European Commission to draft a road map to eliminate Russian oil imports to Hungary and Slovakia by the end of 2027. Both countries were granted exemptions when the EU cut back Russian oil purchases in 2022, and Hungary has signalled resistance to change. Last month, Prime Minister Viktor Orban, considered the closest EU leader to the Kremlin, pledged during a meeting with President Vladimir Putin that he would continue buying Russian hydrocarbons.The latest move comes against the backdrop of a substantial reduction in Russian gas imports since 2021. Before the invasion, 45% of the EU’s imported gas came from Russia. By 2024, that share had fallen to 19%. Europe has sharply cut pipeline deliveries but has partly replaced them with LNG shipped by sea. Russia remains the EU’s second-largest LNG supplier after the United States, accounting for about 20% of LNG imported in 2024 — roughly 20 billion cubic metres out of 100 billion.Imports of Russian LNG into the bloc are expected to reach €15 billion this year, highlighting the financial significance of the embargo once fully enforced.The bloc also plans to use Russia's frozen assets to help Ukraine's economy and war efforts over the next two years. The country's budget and military requirements for 2026 and 2027 will land somewhere around 130 billion euros or $150 billion,which EU has promised to fulfil. Since the war began back in 2022, the bloc has already injected more than 170 billion euros, according to AP.However, the country having most of the assets has rejected the plan.Belgium, where majority of the money is held – having almost 194 billion euros, has refused to use Moscow's frozen assets, saying that the plan major financial and legal risks.Apart from Belgium, Russia also has funds in Japan, with $50 billion, US, UK and Canada, which have comparatively lesser amounts, as of June.Belgian foreign minister Maxime Prevot said that his country considers “the option of the reparations loan the worst of all, as it is risky. It has never been done before.” Russia also flagged the scheme as “theft.”Prevot said, “We are not seeking to antagonize our partners or Ukraine. We are simply seeking to avoid potential disastrous consequences for a member state that is being asked to show solidarity without being offered the same solidarity in return.”Responding to Belgium's concerns, EU said that they indeed do understand the issue.“We take Belgium’s concerns seriously,” German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul told AP.“They are justified, but the issue can be resolved. It can be resolved if we are prepared to take responsibility together.”Belgium has been collecting tax revenue from the frozen Russian assets, and the interest generated is helping finance a G7-backed loan programme for Ukraine.However, the European Central Bank has raised concerns that a proposed EU reparation loan could weaken international confidence in the euro. EU leaders are expected to take up the plan — along with discussions on Ukraine’s economic and military requirements — at the Brussels summit scheduled for December 18.","EU agrees on timeline to completely halt Russian gas imports by autumn 2027. No new long-term pipeline gas contracts with Russian suppliers will be permitted beyond September 30, 2027, as long as storage levels are considered sufficient. Long-term deals for liquefied natural gas (LNG) will stop even sooner. EU also plans to use Russia's frozen assets to help Ukraine's economy and war efforts.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125740754,imgsize-93730,width-400,resizemode-4/.jpg"

‘Tesla is ridiculously overvalued’: Big Short investor Michael Burry warns Musk’s $1 trillion payout will erode value,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/tesla-is-ridiculously-overvalued-big-short-investor-michael-burry-warns-musks-1-trillion-payout-will-erode-value/articleshow/125727364.cms,"Michael Burry says dilution is eating into Tesla’s real worth

A broader critique of tech’s accounting habits

Market reaction and mixed sentiment

Big Short investor Michael Burry has cast doubt on Tesla’s lofty valuation and warned that CEO Elon Musk ’s newly approved $1 trillion compensation package could place even more strain on shareholder returns. In a weekend post on his Substack newsletter, Burry wrote that the electric-vehicle maker’s market value is “ridiculously overvalued” and has been “for a good long time”. His critique focuses largely on how Tesla and other tech firms account for stock-based compensation, which he believes distorts the way investors perceive true profitability.Burry explained that Tesla’s share count increases by roughly 3.6% each year because the company routinely awards employees significant amounts of stock. Since Tesla does not buy back shares to counterbalance these awards, existing shareholders effectively own a smaller slice of the company each year.He shared a chart with his subscribers to illustrate how this steady dilution can erode a company’s present value, especially over long periods. According to Burry, when the real cost of stock-based compensation is fully considered, Tesla’s valuation looks much less defensible than its headline numbers suggest.He also pointed to Musk’s newly approved pay package as a major accelerant. The plan, which passed with 75% shareholder support, could give Musk tens or even hundreds of millions of new Tesla shares if performance targets are met. This could take Musk’s personal stake from 15% to roughly 29%, reducing the ownership percentage of every other shareholder.“Dilution is certain to continue,” Burry wrote, adding that this structural issue is a core reason he believes Tesla’s market value is disconnected from reality.Burry directed part of his criticism at the wider technology industry. He said many tech companies remove stock-based compensation from their “adjusted” earnings results, creating a version of profitability that overlooks a major recurring expense. He argued that companies such as Tesla, Amazon and Palantir routinely benefit from this practice because it makes their financial performance appear healthier than it truly is.He reinforced his point by referencing Warren Buffett, who has long argued that stock-based pay is a real cost to shareholders and should never be treated as an optional footnote.Tesla’s share price dipped slightly after Burry’s comments circulated, although the stock is still up more than 6% this year. Tesla remains valued at about $1.43 trillion.Burry also commented on Tesla’s shifting identity. He said the company’s strongest supporters have changed their narrative repeatedly over the years, moving from electric vehicles to autonomous driving and now to humanoid robots. In his view, this frequent repositioning reflects a company that is constantly searching for its next big justification for growth.The remarks were published on Burry’s newly launched Substack, Cassandra Unchained, which he started after deregistering Scion Asset Management. Many of his recent posts focus on what he believes are emerging bubbles in multiple sectors, particularly artificial intelligence.","Big Short investor Michael Burry says Tesla’s market value is ‘ridiculously overvalued’ His critique focuses largely on how Tesla and other tech firms account for stock-based compensation, which he believes distorts the way investors perceive true profitability.

Philanthropy boost: Michael and Susan Dell pledge $6.25bn for ‘Trump Accounts’ launch; major gift aims to spur families to sign up,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/philanthropy-boost-michael-and-susan-dell-pledge-6-25bn-for-trump-accounts-launch-major-gift-aims-to-spur-families-to-sign-up/articleshow/125721819.cms,"Photo credit- AP

Billionaires Michael and Susan Dell on Tuesday announced a $6.25 billion commitment to encourage American families to open the new children’s investment accounts created under President Donald Trump’s tax and spending legislation, according to AP. The pledge is intended to reach 25 million children under the age of 10 by seeding each eligible account with an initial deposit.The Dells’ gift stands out globally for its size, with few single philanthropic contributions in the last 25 years surpassing even $1 billion, let alone several billion. Announced on GivingTuesday, they believe it is the largest single private commitment ever made to support US children.The contribution will operate through investment accounts administered by the US Department of the Treasury and managed by private firms. The accounts — dubbed “Trump Accounts” in the legislation — are part of a programme passed into law on July 4 and scheduled to launch on July 4, 2026.“We believe that if every child can see a future worth saving for, this program will build something far greater than an account. It will build hope and opportunity and prosperity for generations to come,” said Michael Dell, whose net worth is estimated at $148 billion, AP reported.Through their pledge, the Dells will deposit $250 into each qualifying child’s account. Dell said they chose the launch date to coincide with the 250th anniversary of US independence. “We want these kids to know that not only do their families care, but their communities care, their government, their country cares about them,” said Susan Dell.Under the new law, the Treasury will automatically deposit $1,000 for children born between Jan. 1, 2025 and Dec. 31, 2028, with all funds invested in a stock-market index fund. Families of other children will need to contribute themselves, and the accumulated balance can be used at 18 to pay for education, housing or to start a business.The Dells hope their contribution will push families to claim the accounts and add even small deposits over time while also encouraging companies and philanthropists to participate.“It’s hard to give effective dollars away at scale, particularly to the country’s neediest kids in a way that you have confidence that those dollars are going to compound with the upside of the U.S. economy,” said venture capitalist Brad Gerstner, who supported the legislation and is founder of the Invest America Charitable Foundation, which is helping the Treasury launch the accounts.Gerstner said the initiative aims not only to give young people a financial start but also to ensure they share in the gains of the economy. “Fundamentally, we need to include everybody in the upside of the American experiment. Otherwise, it won’t last,” he said.AP noted that only 58% of US households held stocks or bonds in 2022, with the wealthiest 1% owning nearly half the value of all stocks, while the bottom 50% held about 1%. In 2024, about 13% of US children and young people lived in poverty, according to the Annie E. Casey Foundation, reflecting the lack of social supports such as paid parental leave.The Dells’ contribution will be directed to children living in ZIP codes with median family incomes of $150,000 or less. While the Trump Accounts may help young adults with long-term saving, the initiative will not immediately reduce child poverty. Cuts to Medicaid, food stamps and child-care benefits in the spending package are expected to diminish short-term support for low-income families.Ray Boshara, senior policy adviser with both the Aspen Institute and Washington University in St. Louis, welcomed the multi-sector contribution model. He said the concept resembles other landmark programmes that improved over time. “The ACA, Social Security – they start off fairly flawed, but get much better and more progressive and inclusive over time,” he said. “It’s a down payment on a big idea that deserves to be improved and there’s bipartisan interest in improving them. ”Through the Michael & Susan Dell Foundation, the couple has reported giving $2.9 billion since 1999, with a strong focus on education. Michael Dell said they had not initially expected to commit so much to the new accounts, but Susan Dell said the scale grew as they assessed the programme’s long-term potential. “We’re thrilled to be spearheading this in the philanthropy sector and are so excited because we know that more people are going to jump on board,” she said.",Billionaires Michael and Susan Dell announced a $6.25 billion commitment to encourage American families to open the new children’s investment accounts.

Investors leaned back into technology counters while weighing signals on global interest rates and the broader health of the economy.The S&P 500 was 0.3% higher, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 37 points, or 0.1%, at 9.35am Eastern time. The Nasdaq composite gained 0.6%. MongoDB surged 24.6% after the New York-based database company reported stronger quarterly results than analysts expected. United Natural Foods of Providence, Rhode Island, also advanced 8.4% following a better-than-anticipated profit.Those moves helped offset a 5.6% slide in Signet Jewelers. The company issued a holiday-season revenue forecast that missed market expectations and said it anticipates “a measured consumer environment.”US economy has held up comparatively well, though widening divides persist. Lower-income households remain under pressure from inflation that is still running above preferred levels, while higher-income households benefit from an equity market near the all-time high set in late October.In the bond market, yields were mixed after the previous day’s sharp moves. The 10-year Treasury yield nudged up to 4.10% from 4.09%, while the two-year yield eased to 3.52% from 3.54%. Higher yields can weigh on valuations across asset classes, particularly for sectors considered expensive.Bitcoin, which had fallen below $85,000 on Monday, recovered toward $89,000.Monday’s climb in yields followed comments from the Bank of Japan hinting it may raise interest rates soon. Market expectations still point to another US Federal Reserve rate cut at next week’s meeting in Washington. The Fed has already reduced its overnight rate twice this year to support a slowing job market, though inflation remains above the 2% target, leaving the subsequent policy path uncertain.Overseas, markets moved modestly across much of Europe and Asia.

‘Didn’t want to sell a single share’: SoftBank founder says he was ‘crying’ while offloading Nvidia stake — here’s why,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/didnt-want-to-sell-a-single-share-softbank-founder-says-he-was-crying-while-offloading-nvidia-stake-heres-why/articleshow/125719567.cms,"Nvidia Makes History: First Company to Hit $4 Trillion Market Cap

Turning to ChatGPT



SoftBank Group founder Masayoshi Son revealed that he “was crying” when he sold the company’s stake in Nvidia, highlighting how reluctant he was to part with the fast-rising chipmaker. This emotional exit raises a key question — what compelled Japan’s second-richest man to give up the shares despite not wanting to?Speaking at the FII Priority Asia forum in Tokyo on Monday, Son addressed SoftBank’s November disclosure that it had sold its full Nvidia holding for $5.83 billion. He said that the move was driven purely by the need to raise capital for AI investments and not lack of confidence in Nvidia.He acknowledged the emotional difficulty of the sale and stressed that the shares would not have been offloaded if SoftBank did not need the money.“I don’t want to sell a single share. I just had more need for money to invest in OpenAI and other projects,” Son said during the event, as cited by CNBC.“I was crying to sell Nvidia shares.”His comments reflect the explanation provided by analysts and SoftBank executives in November, when they described the sale as part of broader efforts to bolster the SoftBank Vision Fund’s cash resources for AI.SoftBank has intensified its focus on artificial intelligence this year through a series of projects, including plans for Stargate Project data centres and the acquisition of US chip designer Ampere Computing.SoftBank’s AI push also includes a substantial bet on OpenAI. The Japanese company could “potentially” increase its investment in the ChatGPT maker depending on performance and the valuation of further rounds, according to a person familiar with the matter who spoke to CNBC.Earlier this year, Son said SoftBank was “all in” on OpenAI and predicted that the AI startup would one day become the most valuable company in the world. The bet has already delivered financial benefits, with SoftBank reporting last month that its second-quarter net profit more than doubled to 2.5 trillion yen ($16.6 billion), driven by valuation gains in its OpenAI holdings.Questions around the scale of investment going into AI have fuelled market concerns about the possibility of an AI bubble. Son pushed back against that view during his speech on Monday, arguing that critics are underestimating the sector.He said that those who talk about an AI bubble are “not smart enough” and predicted that “super [artificial] intelligence” and AI robots will generate at least 10% of global gross domestic product over the long term, which he said would outweigh trillions of dollars of investment in the technology.",SoftBank Group founder Masayoshi Son revealed that he “was crying” when he sold the company’s stake in Nvidia.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.","Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor (CEA) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas.

How India's GDP has been growing

What SBI report said on savings and investment

Incremental capital output ratio

NEW DELHI: India's gross domestic product (GDP) data for the third quarter (October-December 2022) received a word of caution from the former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan In an interview with news agency PTI, Rajan that India is ""dangerously close"" to the Hindu rate of growth in view of subdued private sector investment, high interest rates and slowing global growth.India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying"".However, a report released by the State Bank of India (SBI) economists on Tuesday dismissed arguments that India is dangerously close to Hindu rate of growth saying such statements are ""ill-conceived, biased and premature"".The term 'Hindu growth rate' was coined by late economist Raj Krishna in 1978 to describe the slow growth in the country.It basically refers to the low pace of economic growth rates during 1950s to 1980s. During this period, the Indian economy averaged 3.5%.A former lecturer at the Delhi School of Economics (DSE), Krishna noted that only if the rate of growth is persistently slow and accompanied by low per-capita GDP, then it will be known as Hindu rate of growth but it has to factor in population growth as well.Before economic reforms of 1991, India's economic growth remained stagnant and low, while per capita income averaged around 1.3%.Krishna termed this low growth situation to be a result of socialist policies of state control and import substitution.However, the economic situation changed when liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation (LPG) reforms came into effect in the year 1991, at a time when India faced balance of payment crisis.Over the years, many economists have strongly opposed the idea of 'Hindu growth rate' and the term never had universal acceptance.The Indian economy plunged into its very first technical recession in FY21 due to the impact of Covid-19 pandemic and the related nationwide lockdowns. GDP shrunk by an unprecedented 23.8% in the first quarter of the financial year 2020-21. However, due to spurt in economic activities in the subsequent quarters, the GDP decline started to narrow.However, if we look at the period before Covid-19 as well, India's growth curve shows a declining trend.From 8.26% in FY17, GDP growth plunged to 3.74% in FY20. Shutdown of economic activities in FY21 in wake of Covid-19 only made matters worse.As lockdowns started to ease and business activities resumed, India's GDP also started rising. In Q1 of FY22, growth jumped to 20.1% mainly on account of low base effect. By the fourth quarter of FY22, growth came down to 4.10%.Similarly, the new financial year 2022-23 brought fresh economic challenges in the form of Russia-Ukraine war that impacted almost all major economies of the world, slowed the pace of growth, pushed inflation to record highs.As a result, the central banks of all advanced economies spurred into action and opted for monetary policy tightening to curb the soaring inflation.With persistently rising interest rates, India's economy grew by 4.4% in Q3 of FY23, as the Centre revised upwards GDP growth for previous year to 9.10% from 8.7% earlier.The report weighed recent GDP numbers against the available data on savings and investments for the past decade and highlighted some interesting points.""Quarterly growth numbers are noisy and should be best avoided for any serious interpretation (on an average, India's GDP growth has witnessed Rs 2 lakh crore upward revision for the 3 year ended FY23),"" the report said.Gross capital formation (GCF) by the government touched a high of 11.8% in 2021-22, up from 10.7% in 2020-21.""This also had a domino effect on private sector investment that jumped from 10 per cent to 10.8% over the same period,"" it said.In fact, Ecowrap added that the trends in GCF to gross output ratio or the plough back of funds for creation of fresh capacity shows that for public administration the ratio attained fresh peak in 2021-22 owing to the emphasis on capital expenditure in recent budgets.At the aggregate level, gross capital formation is supposed to have crossed 32% in 2022-23, the highest level since 2018-19.According to the report, in 2021-22, gross savings have risen to 30% from 29% in 2020-21.""The ratio is supposed to have crossed 31 per cent in 2022-23, the highest since 2018-19. The household savings increased sharply during the pandemic period on account of sharp accretion in financial savings such as deposits,"" said the report by SBI's Economic Research Department.While household financial savings have since then moderated from 15.4% in 2020-21 to 11.1% in 2022-23, savings in physical assets have grown sharply to 11.8% in 2021-22 from 10.7% in 2020-21.The report further analysed Incremental Capital Output ratio (ICOR) -- which measures additional units of capital (investment) needed to produce additional units of output. It said that the ratio has been improving.""ICOR which was 7.5 in FY 12 is now only 3.5 in FY22. Clearly, only half of capital is now needed for next unit of output,"" the report noted.Such reducing ICOR in the current years reflects a relatively increasing efficiency of capital and shows that the economy is on a sound footing, the report said.""From that point of view, future GDP growth rates even at 7% could still mean a decent number by any standards!,"" it added.","India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter.

An employee is entitled for a 50 per cent amount of the last drawn salary as pension.OPS was discontinued by the NDA government in 2003 with effect from April 1, 2004.Under the new pension scheme (NPS), employees contribute 10 per cent of their basic salary towards pension while the government contributes 14 per cent.Governments of Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand have informed the central government/ Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA about their decision to restart OPS for their employees.The government of Punjab on November 18, 2022, issued a notification regarding implementation of OPS for the state government employees who are being covered under NPS. Jharkhand too has decided to revert to OPS.",Former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan has expressed his concern over the decision of some states to restart the old pension scheme.

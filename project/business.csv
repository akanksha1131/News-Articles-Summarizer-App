Income Tax Department Crackdown

Income Tax Department’s extensive crackdown! Over the past 20 months, the Income Tax Department has collected Rs 37,000 crore from individuals who had taxable income but failed to file returns, according to officials.Officials analysed data on substantial transactions since 2019-20, including purchases of gems, jewellery, property and luxury holidays paid in cash. ""These are the cases where people were not filing tax returns despite making large purchases. The department had reached out to them over the past 20 months,"" a senior official informed ET.The official noted that an expanded and stricter tax collection and TDS system has helped identify significant transactions that previously went unnoticed.The official indicated that some individuals submitted returns claiming zero income despite substantial expenditure and tax obligations. From the total Rs 37,000 crore recovered, Rs 1,320 crore came from individuals involved in high-value transactions.The department is conducting an extensive initiative to contact taxpayers whose spending patterns do not align with their declared income.Since FY21, it has actively used data analytics and the Non-Filer Monitoring System to identify non-compliant individuals.""Data from multiple sources is being tapped and synchronised... This makes it easy for the department to identify such evasion and nab evaders,"" the official stated.Official data revealed that direct tax collections for April-November increased by 15.4% to Rs 12.10 lakh crore, comprising Rs 5.10 lakh crore in corporate tax and Rs 6.61 lakh crore in non-corporate tax.","Officials analysed data on substantial transactions since 2019-20, including purchases of gems, jewellery, property and luxury holidays paid in cash.

"ITR filing deadline: Don’t miss December 31, 2024 deadline for revised, belated tax returns",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/itr-filing-deadline-dont-miss-december-31-2024-deadline-for-revised-belated-tax-returns-here-are-the-consequences/articleshow/116495382.cms,"If one fails to submit a belated return by December 31, 2024, specific consequences apply.

ITR filing: What are the consequences of missing the belated return filing deadline on December 31, 2024?



ITR filing: What if you miss the revised return filing December 31, 2024 deadline?

ITR filing deadline : December 31, 2024, marks the final deadline for submitting belated and revised income tax returns for FY 2023-24 (AY 2024-25). Whilst various taxpayer categories have distinct ITR filing deadlines, the final date for belated and revised returns remains the same. Many individuals remain unaware of the implications of missing the December 31, 2024, submission deadline for FY 2023-24.If one fails to submit a belated return by December 31, 2024, specific consequences apply.Under Section 139(4) of the Income Tax Act, belated returns incur a Rs 5,000 penalty, regardless of outstanding tax amounts. A reduced penalty of Rs 1,000 applies for lower taxable income. However, individuals with income below the Rs 3 lakh basic exemption limit face no penalties.Kinjal Bhuta, Secretary of Bombay Chartered Accountants' Society, told ET, ""Belated return is the last chance for the taxpayer to file the ITR and claim refunds and certain losses. If the belated return is not filed, the person misses those claims and credits for that assessment year. After the expiry of the filing of the belated return, only an updated return can be filed subject to the condition that there is a tax liability payable. Further, if no belated return is filed, the taxpayer shall have to face increased interests and penalties on the tax liabilities if a notice is sent by the income tax department.""A significant limitation of filing belated returns for FY 2023-24 is the inability to select the old tax regime , as the new regime became default from April 1, 2023. Consequently, belated returns must follow the new tax regime .Also Read | Avoid Rs 10 lakh income tax penalty! Why it's important to report foreign income, assets in ITR by December 31, 2024 - check details The old tax regime offered various deductions and exemptions unavailable in the new tax regime. These provisions helped reduce taxable income and subsequent tax obligations.The new regime permits only two deductions: a standard deduction of Rs 50,000 for FY 2023-24 (AY 2024-25) and employer NPS contributions up to 10% of basic salary. Additional benefits like Section 80C, 80D, and HRA exemptions are not applicable under the new structure.When a taxpayer needs to rectify errors in original or belated returns, they must submit a revised return. This allows corrections of various oversights, such as unreported income, unclaimed deductions, or omitted bank account details.Bhuta says, ""If the taxpayer misses the deadline to file a revised return, there is no other mechanism to file a revised return again for that assessment year and to claim refunds or losses. The income tax laws allow the filing of an updated return. However, the updated return cannot be filed in cases where the taxpayer has losses, it results in an increased refund, or the tax return has an effect of reducing the total tax liability as filed in the original or belated return. There are many other criteria as to when an updated return cannot be filed. So, if a taxpayer misses the revised return deadline, the only way in which any additional claim or credit can be requested is during the assessment proceedings. However, that is subject to litigation.""Also Read | PAN 2.0: How to easily apply for PAN Card reprint with QR code - check 6 simple steps online Whilst taxpayers can submit multiple revised returns, tax experts advise against frequent revisions as this could trigger scrutiny from the Income Tax Department.Regarding intimation notices, Bhuta explains, ""As per section 139(5) of the Income Tax Act, 1961, ITR can be revised only before three months before the end of the relevant assessment year or before the completion of assessment, whichever event happens first. The ITR can be revised even after an intimation has been received under section 143(1). However, once the ITR is processed under a regular scrutiny assessment under section 143(3), the same cannot be revised.""For the financial year 2023-24 (AY 2024-25), taxpayers have until December 31, 2024, to submit their revised returns.","December 31, 2024, marks the final deadline for submitting belated and revised income tax returns for FY 2023-24 (AY 2024-25) If one fails to submit a belated return by December 31, 2016, specific consequences apply.

Elon Musk-led Tesla has recommenced its search for showroom locations in New Delhi, according to two sources who spoke to Reuters, indicating a potential reconsideration of its Indian market entry after previously suspending investment plans this year.Following a temporary pause in its Indian showroom search, Tesla has now initiated preliminary discussions with DLF regarding space in the capital region, according to two sources with direct knowledge of the developments.According to one source, Tesla seeks 3,000 to 5,000 square feet for a customer experience centre, plus additional space triple that size for service and delivery operations.The company is considering various locations, including DLF's Avenue Mall in southern Delhi and the Cyber Hub complex in Gurugram.Earlier this year, Elon Musk indicated plans to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi and potentially announce a $2-3 billion investment in India.

Sebi, through an interim order, has also barred several entities involved in the pump-and-dump scam from the market.After rising from about Rs 16 in Nov 2023 to an all-time high of Rs 1,703 on Nov 28 this year, the stock on Friday had closed at Rs 1,236.

Soon after, there were fresh issues of shares through the preferential offer route that eventually resulted in just 41 investors - all preferential allottees - holding 99.5% of the equity shares. These preferential allottees were marked as public shareholders and hence Sebi's shareholding norms for promoters of listed companies were not broken.After the lock-in of shares allotted in the preferential offer ended, the company started making false disclosures to the exchanges about winning big orders from Reliance Industries, Tata Agro, UPL and McCain India.

Will focus on quality public spending: Government,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/will-focus-on-quality-public-spending-government/articleshow/116611722.cms,"NEW DELHI: The finance ministry has told Parliament that the Centre's thrust is on improving the quality of public spending, while strengthening the social security net for the poor and needy.In the statement on deviation from the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act targets, the ministry also said that govt remained committed to pursue the glide path for fiscal consolidation and it will lower fiscal deficit to under 4.5% by next financial year.It said since July, when the regular budget was presented, the global economic environment has become gloomier due to further escalation of conflict. ""Given the prevailing global economic and security environment, it is necessary for govt to retain (a) fair degree of flexibility in conducting its fiscal policy so as to be able to respond to any fallout from adverse global events,"" the ministry said in the nine-page document.Pointing to the numbers on non-debt receipts, fiscal deficit and revenue deficit during the first half of the current financial year, the ministry said the numbers were within the limits prescribed under FRBM rules.While revenue receipts (51.8% of budget estimates) were higher than the five-year moving average, total receipts (43.8%) of the govt were lower. Expenditure was also below the five-year moving average, resulting in the first half fiscal deficit being 29.4% of budget estimate against the five-year moving average of 63.8%.The comment on the quality of expenditure ties in with govt's efforts to focus on higher capex in recent years and cut on wasteful expenditure, besides targeting subsidies better.

JAIPUR: The special investigation team (SIT) of Rajasthan Police is working to piece together events leading up to Friday's accident on Jaipur-Ajmer highway that claimed 13 lives and left over 30 injured.Police sources said they have requested detailed information regarding rules and regulations governing the transport of petroleum, oil, and gas products on roads from relevant companies. The SIT was constituted to investigate the cause of the mishap.The accident occurred when an LPG tanker, carrying gas from Mundra Port in Gujarat to Uttar Pradesh via the Ajmer-Jaipur National Highway, attempted to make a U-turn in Bhankrota area. Shortly after, at 5.44 am, a truck filled with blankets and bedsheets, approaching from the opposite direction, collided with the tanker while it was negotiating the turn.Officials said the driver of the tanker involved in the accident was identified. He had managed to escape the impact zone. “We contacted the vehicle’s owner on Friday and tried reaching him again on Saturday, but he was untraceable. SIT is now looking for whereabouts of the driver,” the official said.“The nozzles and what appear to be safety valves could not withstand the pressure and broke. However, we have to check if the nozzles and valves broke because of the crash with the truck,” officials said. ""Our primary assessment is that the tanker driver is the only person who escaped unscathed from the impact zone,” the official said.Sources said while there have been prior incidents of LPG and CNG tankers overturning on highways, this is the first time that the city police have seen safety valves and nozzles come undone immediately after a crash. The SIT requested the tanker’s fitness certificates and details of the LPG content at the time of the accident, among other things.“We will also approach BPCL regarding their regulatory policies concerning transportation of LPG via roads,” an official said, adding that safety requirements for LPG transportation by road are governed by various regulations, including The Static and Mobile Pressure Vessels Rules 1981.“Modern tankers are designed to withstand shocks encountered during trans- port, but for valves to break off is a cause of concern,” an official remarked. According to regulations cited by authorities, drivers of vehicles carrying petroleum products are trained in using fire extinguishing equipment and are informed of emergency procedures to follow.“The driver fled without alerting anyone because he knew there could be an explosion any moment. It would be too early to pin the blame single-handedly on the driver without proper investigation,” officials said.","The special investigation team (SIT) of Rajasthan Police is working to piece together events leading up to Friday's accident.

What is GRAP?

Expert opinions

NEW DELHI: Every winter, as the Air Quality Index (AQI) in NCR plunges to hazardous levels, govt rolls out its Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) – a court-mandated emergency protocol to temporarily reduce air-pollution.Though well-intentioned, some provisions have been doing exactly the opposite. Causing more pollution , or the reduction in pollution—if at all—is too small compared to the havoc it causes to the public. Here is a pick of four such measures that need relook:The blanket ban on construction and demolition work under GRAP impacts thousands of daily-wage labourers, forcing many to leave the city in winter. There are nearly 13.8 lakh such workers registered in Delhi alone. As TOI has written recently, most of them do not get the compensation they are supposed to get during such bans.That aside, construction stops only in a few places and goes on blatantly in most places—e.g. thousands of home renovations or constructions. It’s beyond any law enforcement agency to identify and halt such work. What halts immediately, however, are much-needed public works like repair of badly broken but heavily used roads.traffic congestion and dust, which compounds the pollution problem. Often, some dust-emitting large govt projects remain exempt from the ban.Mandate green construction practices, instead of halting work. China, for example, is making environmentally sustainable buildings a standard by 2027. Even in 2020, green building initiatives constituted 77% of China's new urban development projects. Law enforcement agencies can do random check of construc tion sites for their adherence to green norms and seal those not in compliance. This will balance the need for pollution control with continuity of economic activities.In the name of implementing GRAP, the police places barricades across the city, which brings traffic to halt at peak hours. It causes congestion and adds to pollution. To catch a fraction of non-complaint vehicles, every vehicle is halted or slowed. The traffic policemen are compelled to inhale the same toxic air. An officer said they have an app through which they can check the registration of vehicles, and also a booklet with pictures of different vehicles and specifications to help identify the ones that are banned. But that doesn’t help.Govt agencies should ensure that owners of vehicles not supposed to be on road during GRAP receive a message on their phone. While some did receive such messages from the Delhi transport department last year, many didn’t this year. A system should be developed to identify old and banned vehicles plying on the roads through CCTV cameras and penalise them. And if such a system isn’t possible to build, stop this measure all together. The feasibility-desirability mismatch is just too high.At Delhi’s 154 entry points, green tax collection often creates bottlenecks due to manual and haphazard processes. Of these, only 11 are equipped with RFID systems, exacerbating de lays and pollution. On average, 1,05,989 commercial vehicles enter the city every day. Of this, around 70,000 vehicles are cabs.Expand RFID-based contactless systems for smooth tax collection. Create dedicated lanes for commercial and non-commercial vehicles to reduce congestion.Deployed in three shifts across the city, anti-smog guns spray water to settle dust but often obstruct traffic and waste resources. They hinder the movement of traffic by blocking one lane of busy roads during peak hours. The sights of cabs or private cars tailing smoke-guns to clean their windscreen are all too common! According to official data, 200 anti-smog guns have been deployed in the city.Assess the utility of anti-smog guns with a data-driven approach. Deploy them during non-peak hours to minimise congestion and focus, instead, on long-term dust control measures.Increasing parking fees under GRAP aims to deter private vehicles but overlooks Delhi’s glaring public transport gaps. Delhi Metro is the most preferred modes of transport, but last-mile connectivity is still a big challenge. Delhi currently has 7,683 buses, including govtrun DTC and cluster buses, but the number is significantly lower than the demand. On an average, 70 buses – both DTC and cluster – break down in the city every day, causing significant traffic congestion and inconvenience to commuters.There is no parking management plan either. In 2020, the Supreme Court had directed formulation of a comprehensive parking policy, which is nowhere in sight.Once the last-mile connectivity of metro improves, DTC buses are adequate and reliable and there is a single ticketing of all local commuting options, the use of private vehicles will come down on its own.While GRAP’s intent to curb air pollution is commendable, its execution is often devoid of ground realities. For meaningful change, Delhi needs long-term, structural reforms that address pollution at its roots rather than relying on temporary fixes that disrupt lives and livelihoods.GRAP is a set of emergency pollution-control measures ?rst formulated in 2016 and implemented from 2017 onwards under the guidance of the Supreme Court and various environmental authorities. It operates in stages, with restrictions escalating as pollution worsens.GRAP measures are short-term emergency responses, not long-term solutions. The city needs year-round actions like fleet electrification, better public transport, green construction technology, and effective waste management to eliminate the need for GRAP. —Anumita RoyChowdhury | Executive director, CSEReal estate must adopt dust-control measures and sustainable practices like prefabrication and ready-mix concrete. Anti-smog guns and mechanised sweeping vehicles should have staggered schedules to reduce congestion-induced pollution—Sunil Dahiya | Founder, Envirocatalysts","The Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) is a court-mandated emergency protocol to temporarily reduce air-pollution.

The three combining companies would collectively manufacture approximately 8 million vehicles. During 2023, Honda manufactured 4 million units, Nissan 3.4 million, and Mitsubishi Motors made just over 1 million.Earlier in August, Nissan, Honda and Mitsubishi announced their intention to join hands on electric vehicle components and autonomous driving software research, following an initial agreement between Nissan and Honda in March.Sam Fiorani, vice president of AutoForecast Solutions said that Honda could benefit from Nissan's truck-based SUVs like the Armada and Infiniti QX80, while gaining from Nissan's expertise in battery technology, electric vehicles and hybrid powertrains.Earlier, Nissan announced layoffs affecting 9,000 staff globally in November, alongside a 20% reduction in production capacity, after reporting losses of 9.3 billion yen.

The govt then asked the judge to force Google to sell Chrome, the world's most popular browser, among other remedies.In Google's own proposal to fix the search monopoly, it asked Mehta to allow it to continue to pay other companies for its search engine to get prime placement.

Britannica didn't just survive. It's an AI company now,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/britannica-didnt-just-survive-its-an-ai-company-now/articleshow/116551465.cms,"For nearly 250 years, the Encyclopaedia Britannica was a bookshelf-busting series of gilt-lettered tomes, often purchased to show that its owners cared about knowledge. It was the sort of physical media expected to die in the internet era, and indeed, the encyclopedia's publisher announced that it was ending the print edition in 2012. Skeptics wondered how Britannica the company could survive in the age of Wikipedia. The answer was to adapt to the times.Britannica Group runs websites, including Britannica.com and the online Merriam-Webster dictionary, and sells educational software to schools and libraries. It also sells artificial intelligence agent software that underpins apps like customer service chatbots and data retrieval.Britannica has figured out not only how to survive, but also how to do well financially. Jorge Cauz, its CEO, said in an interview that the publisher enjoyed pro forma profit margins of about 45%.The company is weighing an initial public offering, in which it could seek a valuation of about $1 billion, according to a person with knowledge of the deliberations.That could provide a sizable return for the company's owner, Swiss financier Jacob E Safra, who acquired the publisher in 1995 and, in a lawsuit filed in 2022, cited an investment bank in valuing Britannica at $500 million. The company says its websites draw over 7 billion annual page views a year, with users in more than 150 countries.Britannica has come far from its origins in the 18th century as the publisher of a reference work put together by three Scottish printers. Over the years, the Encyclopaedia Britannica became a heavyweight of the knowledge business, both literally - the 32-volume 2010 edition, the last to run in print, weighed 129 pounds - and figuratively, drawing on contributions from thousands of experts. It also became an aspirational status symbol, with customers paying nearly $1,400 for that edition.By the time the last Encyclopaedia Britannica was printed, the company had already started its suite of websites and educational software. Now it sees even greater opportunity in the growth of generative AI tools , which the company says can help make learning more dynamic - and therefore more desirable.Cauz said Britannica had experimented with the technology over the past few decades. It acquired Melingo, the company that makes its AI agent software, in 2000 because of its strength in natural language processing and machine learning. And it has two technology teams, based in Chicago and in Tel Aviv.The vertiginous popularity of chatbots like ChatGPT convinced executives that they needed to invest more in the space. Britannica now uses AI in creating, fact-checking and translating content for its products, including the online encyclopedia.

Tesla is recalling almost 700,000 vehicles because of an issue with the warning light on the tire pressure monitoring system .According to a letter Thursday from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the recall includes certain 2024 Cybertruck, 2017-2025 Model 3, and 2020-2025 Model Y vehicles.The issue is that the tire pressure monitoring system warning light on the vehicles may not remain illuminated between drive cycles, failing to warn the driver of low tire pressure.

Amid the booming crypto market, Dogecoin market activity has spurred in the past 24 hours, a signal of an impending bullish rally. Popular market watchers have projected massive rallies, which could push the DOGE price to a new ATH. Pepe is another top meme coin witnessing massive whale accumulation, a move that could double the Pepe coin price soon.Meanwhile, Lunex Network's (LNEX) early investors are now swimming in profits as the price continues to surge in presale. As a next-generation DeFi exchange, LNEX is projected to follow the path of top exchange tokens like BNB, with experts projecting the price to reach $0.50 this bull cycle.Looking at the YTD price metrics , Dogecoin has gained over 318%, outperforming many other notable meme coins. Just like Pepe Coin, Dogecoin's price has witnessed a slight correction in the past few days. However, the top crypto coin has maintained support above $0.40, a catalyst that could trigger a rebound soon.With the rising Dogecoin trading volume, a resurgence could trigger another round of bull run. According to Ali Martinez, a notable crypto market analyst, the bull cycle is still early. Ali believes now is the best time to buy the altcoin with a projection of Dogecoin price hitting $3 in the bull cycle and $18 in the long term.Having bounced back from the oversold zone and now heading to the overbought zone, crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade thinks that Dogecoin crypto will hit $8 to $10 this bull cycle. However, a drop could push the DOGE price to the floor price of around $0.80 to $1.80. The Dogecoin market sentiment is bullish with Fear and Greed index 78, a bullish signal.According to Lookonchain data, whales have continued to accumulate Pepe tokens. As per the tweet, 9 wallets spent 13.8M $DAI to buy 555B Pepe Coin in the past few hours. CoinMarketCap data shows Pepe trading volume has reacted positively in the past 24 hours, rising by 75% to $12B.Meanwhile, Pepe technical indicators are looking good, with the meme coin trading above the 50-day and 200-day SMAs. Also, the Pepe market sentiment is bullish, with over 16 green days in the 30D timeframe. Having established support above $0.000025, the Pepe price could flip the ATH of $0.000028 and set a new record in the coming days.According to Rose Premium Signal, a crypto analyst on X, Pepe's price will hit $0.00004251 in the short term. The analyst believes $0.000020 is a good entry point in case of a dip. In a tweet, another analyst, Chandler Bing, thinks the altcoin price is about to break out with a potential target of $0.000031.Lunex Network (LNEX) is rising to become a major force in the DeFi space. As a next-gen web3 DeFi crypto exchange, Lunex Network is built to solve issues of interoperability, scalability, and high gas fees in exchanges. As a non-custodial exchange, the new trading exchange will allow for easy buying, selling and swapping of digital assets without the need for KYC.Designed with advanced trading tools, Lunex Network will allow traders access to over 50,000 trading pairs at the cheapest fees. Its unique portfolio tracker will allow traders to track multiple assets like cryptos, stocks, etc. The DeFi wallet enables traders to seamlessly buy, sell, and swap cryptos from one account.Unlike other exchanges, Lunex Network has several avenues to reward the community. There is a revenue-sharing model aimed at rewarding the LNEX token holders. Also, token holders can access discounts on transaction fees or stake their tokens for maximum APY. As a deflationary token, all listing fees will be paid in LNEX, putting buying pressure.Experts who have reviewed the project think that LNEX will follow the path of BNB, which surged by over 1,000% within a few months of listing. As such, at just $0.0046, investors have the opportunity to accumulate the token. Given the over $5.3 million raised in the cryptocurrency ICO funding and the 283% ROI for early investors, LNEX might hit $1 on listing in a major exchange.This year's crypto rally has been explosive, with altcoins setting new records. With the Dogecoin price showing signs of a resurgence, the top meme coin could set a new ATH soon. The rising interest in Pepe among whales makes it one of the altcoins to watch out for in this bull cycle. Given the huge ROI of LNEX within a short time, the new DeFi coin could hit $1 by the time the trading exchange launches fully.You can find more information about Lunex Network (LNEX) here:Website: Lunex Network Telegram: Join Our Telegram Community Twitter: Follow Us On X","Just like Pepe Coin, Dogecoin's price has witnessed a slight correction in the past few days.

Bond yields climb, stock market feels the squeeze

Winners and losers on Wall Street

Global markets and economic uncertainty

Economic outlook clouds amid inflation and political shifts

US stock markets endured one of their most severe declines of the year on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve signaled a shift in its monetary policy trajectory. The S&P 500 fell 2.9%, narrowly missing its largest loss of 2024, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average plummeted by 1,123 points, or 2.6%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite suffered the worst drop, declining 3.6%.The central bank announced its third rate cut of the year, lowering its main interest rate to a range of 4.25% to 4.50%. However, it was the Fed’s updated projections for 2025 that rattled investors: Policymakers now anticipate only two additional cuts next year, down from four projected just three months ago.“We are in a new phase of the process,” Fed Chair Jerome Powell said, explaining the tempered outlook as a response to robust job market performance, rising inflation readings, and economic uncertainties, including the upcoming Trump administration’s policies.Treasury yields surged following the Fed's announcement, exerting additional pressure on stocks. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.51% from 4.40%, while the two-year yield, more sensitive to Fed actions, increased to 4.35% from 4.25%.Higher yields typically hurt stock valuations, particularly for companies reliant on borrowing to drive growth. The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies tumbled 4.4%, reflecting the acute impact of rising interest rates on smaller-cap stocks.“We’re seeing the market recalibrate for a ‘higher for longer’ rate environment,” said Sam Stovall of CFRA Research. “The Fed’s announcement caught investors off guard, eroding confidence in the expected pace of rate reductions.”Among individual stocks, General Mills fell 3.1% despite better-than-expected quarterly profits, as its lowered profit forecast for the year spooked investors. Nvidia, a significant driver of this year’s market rally, dropped 1.1%, extending its losses to over 13% since its record high last month.Conversely, Jabil surged 7.3% after reporting stronger-than-expected quarterly earnings and raising its full-year revenue forecast.Global markets displayed mixed reactions. In London, the FTSE 100 rose marginally by less than 0.1%, buoyed by data showing UK inflation at an eight-month high. The Bank of England is expected to keep rates unchanged when it announces its decision on Thursday.Japan’s Nikkei 225 fell 0.7%, even as Nissan shares jumped 23.7% on reports of potential collaboration with Honda. Meanwhile, Mitsubishi Motors, partly owned by Nissan, saw its shares soar nearly 20%.Powell noted that while rate cuts could stimulate economic growth, they also risk exacerbating inflation. “When the path is uncertain, you go a little slower,” he said, likening the Fed’s approach to navigating a foggy night.Lingering inflationary pressures and the transition to the Trump administration have introduced additional variables into the Fed’s calculus. Powell acknowledged that some officials are already weighing the implications of potential fiscal policy changes, including tariffs and spending initiatives.Cleveland Fed President Beth Hammack was the lone dissenter in Wednesday’s decision, arguing against the rate cut.As Wall Street digests the Fed’s outlook, concerns grow that the anticipated “Santa Claus rally” may be replaced by further volatility, with analysts suggesting that traders may lock in profits amid uncertainty.(With inputs from agencies)","The S&P 500 fell 2.9%, narrowly missing its largest loss of 2024.

US Federal Reserve cuts interest rate by 25 basis points in key FOMC meet,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-federal-reserve-cuts-interest-rate-by-25-basis-points-in-key-fomc-meet/articleshow/116445969.cms,"Recent economic indicators, including Tuesday's robust November retail sales data, align with the Federal Reserve's assessment of a strong economy.

The US Federal Reserve cut the interest rate by 25 basis points on Wednesday, according to an official statement following the key FOMC meeting. This 25 basis points cut has led to the central banks benchmark policy rate being in the 4.25% to 4.50% range. This represents a decrease of one full percentage point from its September level, when the Fed initiated the relaxation of stringent monetary measures implemented to address the inflation spike that commenced in 2021.The US central bank modified a crucial component of its interest rate management system on Wednesday by reducing the reverse repo facility rate more significantly than the federal funds rate reduction. The reverse repo rate has been decreased by 30 basis points to 4.25% from its previous 4.55%.Market specialists suggest this anticipated adjustment represents the Federal Reserve's effort to encourage the movement of funds away from a facility that is commonly regarded as an indicator of surplus liquidity within the financial framework.The overnight reverse repo facility (ONRPP) rate, which the Federal Reserve offers, enables money market funds and other entities to deposit funds with the central bank through what essentially amounts to a secured loan. This ONRPP rate functions to establish a flexible lower boundary for all short-term interest rates.""In considering the extent and timing of additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. The Committee will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage‑backed securities. The Committee is strongly committed to supporting maximum employment and returning inflation to its 2 percent objective,"" the FOMC statement read.""In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals. The Committee's assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments,"" the statement added.Recent economic indicators, including Tuesday's robust November retail sales data, align with the Federal Reserve's assessment of a strong economy marked by strong growth, minimal unemployment, and gradually declining, yet persistently elevated inflation levels.KPMG's chief economist Diane Swonk in her pre-meeting analysis said, ""Debate will be heated,"" she said. ""The economy remains stronger than participants at the meeting thought it would be when they started cutting in September, while improvements in inflation appear to have stalled ... The Fed is going to want time to pause to see where we are and how policy may shift after the president-elect is sworn in.""Following Trump's inauguration on January 20, the Fed's subsequent meeting occurs on January 28-29. A Reuters survey indicates that 58 out of 99 economists anticipate the central bank will maintain current rates during this meeting, allowing time to evaluate economic developments.","The US Federal Reserve cut the interest rate by 25 basis points on Wednesday.

"Amazon’s cloud unit bets on new models, chips to catch up in AI race",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/amazons-cloud-unit-bets-on-new-models-chips-to-catch-up-in-ai-race/articleshow/116444528.cms,"(The writer was in Las Vegas at invitation of AWS)

LAS VEGAS: Amazon’s cloud unit AWS unveiled new AI models and chips to take on rivals like Microsoft, which has had an edge due to its ties with ChatGPT-maker OpenAI.Exactly two years ago, the launch of ChatGPT forced tech giants to redraw plans, wiping out billions from market caps of companies that were slow to adapt. AWS, which pioneered renting out data infrastructure, was seen to be losing grip on its cloud dominance over the past two years amid the AI boom.However, Andy Jassy, who built AWS before succeeding Jeff Bezos as Amazon CEO in 2021, sees it differently. “When we talk about AI, it is typically less to announce that we have beat the best chess player in the world... We are not using AI because we think it is cool. We are using it because we are trying to solve customer problems,” Jassy said at AWS’s annual tech event re:Invent in Las Vegas last week. AWS has sought to embed AI into its services and push customers to bring more of their applications by offering them a wide choice of AI models and chips, including its in-house ones, through its Bedrock platform.“With the announcement of Nova, we have made it clear that we want to compete... Whether it’s chips or models, we will be very competitive on costs,” Sherry Marcus, director of applied science (GenAI) at AWS, told TOI. Nova, which launched last week, is AWS’s answer to AI foundation models like Google’s Gemini and OpenAI’s GPT-4o. Essentially, these are machine learning models trained on vast datasets and designed to produce a range of outputs, including chatbots.AI-related capabilities dominated AWS’s announcements at the cloud conference. The company unveiled AI semiconductor Trainium2 which is expected to chip away at Nvidia ’s stranglehold by reducing customer costs. AWS unveiled Apple as one of its newest chip customers. It also announced an ‘ultracluster’ — which aims to provide supercomputer-like computing power to let customers train their AI models using multiple chips. It will also enable Anthropic, an AI startup into which Amazon has poured $8 billion, to train its Claude models and take on Microsoft-backed OpenAI.According to analysts, rapid tech development means that no company has a moat, and breakthroughs are quickly adopted by other companies. In such a scenario, the key challenge will be to retain customers who may find it increasingly easy to switch vendors amid antitrust scrutiny.“Customers are driven by cost, accuracy & latency (data transfer delay)... (AI) models are becoming more of a commodity. It’s not like two years ago, where you’ll be chasing the new shiny star,” AWS’s Marcus said.AWS is also betting on AI startups in the early stages by offering millions of dollars worth of credits for its cloud services.AWS head of startups (Asia-Pacific & Japan) Tiffany Bloomquist told TOI: “In India, in addition to Mumbai and Bangalore, I went to Coimbatore... Even in tier-2 cities, developers are seeing AI as a critical new enabler to disrupt traditional technologies they operate in.”Analysts say that even as Microsoft has gained AI market share, AWS has brought potential solutions with its new launches.“AWS has the edge with machine learning workloads and customers, which should be easy to move to GenAI,” Patrick Moorhead, chief analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy, said. “The AI race is a marathon, not a sprint.”",AWS has sought to embed AI into its services and push customers to bring more of their applications.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume.While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

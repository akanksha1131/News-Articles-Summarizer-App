Gold price prediction today: Gold prices are expected to continue their rally as demand for safe haven assets picks up, says Praveen Singh, Senior Fundamental Research Analyst- Currencies and Commodities at Mirae Asset Sharekhan. Here’s his outlook on gold prices:

Gold Performance:

Spot gold attracted safe haven bids on Monday, i.e., January 5 and surged more than 2.5% as the US President Trump capturing and removing Venezuelan leader Maduro heightened geopolitical risks that other countries with strained relations with could also be targeted.

The metal surged to $4456, highest in a week.

At the time of writing this article, spot gold was changing hands at $4445, up 2.65% for the day, while the MCX February contract at Rs 137,997 was up 1.65%.

Earlier, the shiny metal tumbled over 4% in the week ending January 2 on profit booking and margin hike related selloff.

Geopolitics watch:

Maduro’s forcible removal has ignited a fresh wave of geopolitical concern, especially among nations whose relations with the United States have historically been uneasy. Many view the episode through the long arc of US interventionism in Latin America—from early 20th‑century regime changes to Cold War–era interventions—raising fears that countries deemed unfriendly to Washington could face similar pressure.

The US operation in Venezuela serves as a stark reminder of Washington’s apparent revival of the Monroe Doctrine, first articulated in 1823 to oppose external powers’ influence in the Western Hemisphere and later invoked throughout the 20th century to justify strategic interventions.

The Venezuela Episode signals a clear message to contemporary rivals such as China and Russia: The Western Hemisphere remains firmly within the traditional US sphere of influence.

Geopolitical risks loom large: The US President Trump has threatened military action against Colombia as he accused the nation of selling cocaine to the US.

Trump has once again expressed interest in Greenland as a strategic region for the US interests.

US Treasury of State Marco Rubio, in a show on NBC on Sunday, called Cuba a huge problem.

Many Chinese social media users opined that the Venezuelan operation offers a template for how China could handle the Taiwan issue.

Data roundup:

US ISM manufacturing Index fell to 47.90 in December from 48.20 in November; the data trailed the estimate of 48.20; thus, contracted more than expected. Manufacturing contracted for the tenth straight month as it suffered the worst contraction since October 2025. ISM prices remained elevated at 58.50 while new orders and employment contracted.

China's RatingDog PMI composite at 51.30 in December beat the prior reading of 51.2 as Services Index in December at 52 remained encouraging.

Upcoming data:

Major US data on tap this week include ISM services Index (January 7), JOLTs job openings (January 7), nonfarm payroll report (January 9) and University of Michigan sentiment and inflation readings (Jan. 9).

China's PPI and CPI for the month of December will be released on January 9. China will update its forex reserves data on January 7; it will update its gold holdings also in the process.

Major Eurozone on the deck include Services PMI (January 6), CPI (January 7) and retail sales (Jan. 9).

UK's services and composite PMIs will be out on January 6.

Richmond Fed President Barkin will speak on economic outlook and monetary policy at Raleigh Chamber Economic Forecast 2026:

Fedspeak:

Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis President Neel Kashkari said Monday that interest rates may be close to a neutral level for the US economy now. He added that incoming data should guide the central bank’s actions.

Dollar Index and yields:

At the time of writing this article, the US Dollar Index was trading at 98.60, up around 0.20% for the day.

2-Year US yields were down by 1 bps to 3.46%, while ten-year yields fell 2 bps to 4.17%.

ETF holdings and COMEX inventory:

As of January 2, total known global gold ETF holdings stood at 98.84 MOz, down 0.1 MOz for the week, though holdings hover around the highest level since September 2022.

Registered COMEX gold inventory remained unchanged at 19.362 MOz for the seventh straight day as of January 2.

COMEX Gold delivery:

COMEX gold delivery amounted to 369 units in the week ending January 2, lowest weekly delivery volume since the third week of September.

CFTC data:

Updated CFTC data shows that investors are increasing their net longs in several commodities, most notably of which are gold, gasoline, copper and silver as they increase their net long positions on commodities currencies like Brazilian Real and Mexican Peso.

Gold Price Outlook

:

Spot gold is expected to extend its rally on renewed safe haven demand. The Caribbean geopolitical situation will serve as an additional boost to the global central banks’ drive to increase gold’s share in their forex reserve holdings.

Risk will come from the US ISM services, JOLTs and nonfarm payroll data. In addition, the CME could hike margins further to curb speculative instincts. Commodity Index rebalancing induced selling is yet another risk. Five-day Index rebalancing will begin from January 8.

The metal may test the resistance at $4550. Dip buying is the favoured strategy.

Support at $4393/$4296.Resistance is at $4472/$4550.

Silver outlook:

Shaky looking silver caught fresh aggressive bids on Monday on geopolitical concerns.

Total known global silver ETF holdings remain elevated at 863.79 MOz, highest since June 2022. Spot silver jumped over 5% on January 5.

At the time of writing, the grey metal was trading at $77.63, up around 7% for the day. The MCX March Silver contract at Rs 247,455 was up 4.70%.

One-month silver lease rate at 8.52% remains elevated and is at the highest since October 23.

Healthy risk appetite is also boosting silver prices.

Silver may test the resistance around $80/$81. A surge to $85 is not ruled out should the US Dollar soften.

Support is at $75/$73.36/$72.50/$70. Resistance is at $78.69/$80.72/$85.

Venezuela oil exports: Asia-bound shipments stalled for fifth day amid US embargo; PDVSA faces stockpile stress,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/venezuela-oil-exports-asia-bound-shipments-stalled-for-fifth-day-amid-us-embargo-pdvsa-faces-stockpile-stress/articleshow/126377245.cms,"File photo (Picture credit: AP)

Venezuela’s main oil ports entered a fifth straight day without shipping crude to customers in Asia, the country’s biggest buyers, as US pressure on the OPEC producer intensified under an oil embargo, shipping data showed.The halt in deliveries risks worsening problems for state-run oil firm PDVSA, which is already struggling with output and refining constraints.An extended export freeze to Asia could force PDVSA to deepen production cuts begun in recent days due to a build-up of crude and residual fuel stocks, Reuters reported.While exports to Asia remained stalled, Chevron, PDVSA’s key joint-venture partner, resumed shipments of Venezuelan oil to the United States on Monday after a four-day pause.The US major also recalled overseas staff to its Venezuela offices as flights restarted. Chevron has emerged as the only company currently exporting Venezuelan crude smoothly, according to Reuters.Despite the embargo, at least a dozen sanctioned vessels that loaded crude and fuel in December left Venezuelan waters in early January carrying about 12 million barrels bound for China.The tankers sailed in “dark mode” with transponders switched off, breaking a US tanker blockade imposed last month.Washington has not said whether those departures were authorised, Reuters said.Separately, the administration of President Donald Trump is planning meetings this week with executives from US oil companies to discuss boosting Venezuela’s oil production after US forces arrested President Nicolas Maduro, sources told Reuters.The White House said it believes US oil firms are ready to invest, though analysts caution that rebuilding output would take years and billions of dollars due to damaged infrastructure and political uncertainty.Chevron remains the only American major operating in Venezuela, while Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips exited years ago following nationalisation.Investors reacted positively, with US energy stocks rising sharply after the developments, Reuters reported.","Venezuela's main oil ports entered a fifth straight day without shipping crude to customers in Asia, the country’s biggest buyers.

Stock market today: Nifty50 and BSE Sensex , the Indian equity benchmark indices, opened in red on Wednesday. While Nifty50 went below 26,150, BSE Sensex was down over 100 points. At 9:18 AM, Nifty50 was trading at 26,132.00, down 47 points or 0.18%. BSE Sensex was at 84,953.09, down 110 points or 0.13%.Analysts believe that equity markets are expected to move in a narrow range in the near term, as optimism from encouraging third-quarter business updates is offset by lingering geopolitical risks.Dr. VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Investments Limited says, “The recent market movements have been devoid of any trend and clear direction. Actions in a few mega stocks are influencing the overall market disproportionately. For instance, yesterday despite positive institutional buying Nifty drifted down by 71 points, mainly due to sharp declines in two stocks- Reliance and HDFC Bank. The large volumes in these two stocks in the derivative and cash market indicate activity associated with settlement day. In other words, the sharp dips in these stocks have nothing to do with their fundamentals; it is more technical in nature.”“Going forward, there is scope for high volatility caused by events and news. Trump tweets and actions can always influence the market. Another important event which investors should closely watch is a possible Supreme Court verdict on Trump tariffs very soon. If the verdict goes against the reciprocal tariffs it will create huge volatility in stock markets.”Global cues were mixed. Wall Street closed higher on Tuesday, supported by a strong rally in semiconductor stocks driven by renewed enthusiasm around artificial intelligence. Shares of Moderna also advanced, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed to a fresh record high.Asian markets paused on Wednesday after a strong start to the year. Japanese equities declined amid rising tensions with China, prompting some investors to turn cautious despite the broader strength seen in global stocks so far this year.On the institutional front, foreign portfolio investors were net sellers of Indian equities worth Rs 107 crore on Tuesday, according to exchange data. Domestic institutional investors, however, continued to provide support to the market, recording net purchases of Rs 1749 crore.","While Nifty50 went below 26,150, BSE Sensex was down over 100 points.

A tax before the benefit arrives

every single year

tax incidence

actual receipt

Taxing the employee’s own PF savings

The bigger picture: When rules punish good behaviour

Tax on employer contributions beyond ₹7.5 lakh

Tax on the growth of such contributions

Tax on interest from their own PF contributions beyond ₹2.5 lakh

Tax on NPS pension at retirement

Tax again if early withdrawal triggers PF conditions

Why reform is required

For a country that prides itself on a thriving middle class, India’s tax treatment of retirement savings has begun to feel oddly out of step with economic reality. Over the past few years, a series of amendments—presented as “rationalisations”—have quietly created a minefield for salaried employees who believed they were doing the right thing by saving for their future.Three provisions stand out for the burden they impose: taxation of employer contributions to provident and superannuation funds beyond ₹7.5 lakh; yearly taxation of accretions on such excess contributions; and taxation of interest earned on the employee’s own PF contributions above ₹2.5 lakh. In isolation each may appear technical. Together, they are reshaping retirement planning in ways that leave employees with little clarity, greater financial anxiety, and a rising tax bill on income they do not even receive today.The first shock for employees came with the Finance Act, 2020, which capped employer contributions to recognised PF, approved superannuation funds and NPS at ₹7.5 lakh per year. Anything above that—common for senior professionals, mid-level employees in high-cost cities, and those in organisations with generous retirement policies—became taxable as a perquisite.But what stings more is that annual accretion—interest, dividend or similar growth—on this “excess contribution” is also taxed. This is a tax on notional income, long before the employee sees a rupee of it.Many describe this as an upfront penalty on saving. Unlike bonuses or cash payments, retirement contributions are locked in for the long term. Yet tax is now collected today on money that may only be received decades later. That mismatch betweenandhas become a major pain point.When exemption isn’t really exemptionThe hardship intensifies when the National Pension System comes into play. While the government justified taxing excess employer contributions by calling PF, superannuation and NPS an “EEE regime”, the law doesn’t fully support that claim.Under Section 10(12A), up to 60% of the NPS corpus can be withdrawn tax-free upon closure of the account or opting out of NPS. The remaining 40% must be used to purchase an annuity plan from a life insurance company, and the pension received from this annuity is fully taxable. Employees therefore argue that the premise of an entirely exempt regime is not accurate.The Finance Act, 2021 introduced another hit: PF interest earned on the employee’s own contribution beyond ₹2.5 lakh per year is taxable.For many mid-career employees, PF is the only disciplined savings instrument they rely on. A high PF contribution isn’t a luxury; it is a way to secure the future in the absence of universal social security.Yet the law now characterises high contributions—even when mandatory or part of salary structure—as an attempt to “enjoy full exemption”. The sting is sharper for those whose basic salary is high enough that the statutory 12% PF contribution itself may cross the ₹2.5 lakh threshold, triggering tax on interest even when the employee never intended to “over-contribute”. This change is seen as especially harsh in a country where inflation erodes purchasing power and pension adequacy is already a concern.“Also, these changes all appear to be part of the ultimate aim of the government to do away with all deductions and exemptions and make the ‘new tax regime’ the only regime available for all taxpayers,” says Ameet Patel, partner, Manohar Chowdhry & Associates.Across these provisions, a consistent theme emerges:India now taxes retirement savings more aggressively. Employees who save diligently, especially mid- to senior-level workers, face:The result is that long-term savings face multiple tax points.There is growing consensus across industry bodies that these provisions need urgent review. The argument is not about giving employees a windfall—it is about ensuring fairness and a safety net. With an ageing population, lack of a universal social security system applicable to all citizens, and rising cost of living, the existing provisions are detrimental . India’s salaried class feels squeezed—not because they don’t want to pay taxes, but because the system increasingly treats retirement savings as a luxury rather than a necessity. What was once a predictable, trusted savings pathway is now layered with caps, tax triggers, and compliance complications.“And this compounds the problems that the ageing population faces when insurance companies either refuse to issue new health policies to senior citizens or charge such high premia on the policies that having a Mediclaim policy becomes extremely expensive for such retired persons. As and when such a person needs large amounts to be paid to hospitals for medical treatments, the depleted savings are often inadequate and the entire family is put under huge financial stress,” concludes Patel.","India’s tax treatment of retirement savings has begun to feel oddly out of step with economic reality. A high PF contribution isn’t a luxury; it is a way to secure the future in the absence of universal social security.

RBI tightens dividend payout rules for banks,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/rbi-tightens-dividend-payout-rules-for-banks/articleshow/126381639.cms,"MUMBAI: RBI has issued draft rules to tighten dividend payouts by banks by linking distributions to capital adequacy, asset and profit quality, setting a uniform prudential framework effective from FY27. In the previous financial year, banks paid over Rs 75,000 crore dividend after booking record profits.Under RBI's draft rules, dividend payments by banks will be governed by a common set of conditions from FY27. The directions apply to all banking companies, corresponding new banks and SBI, and to foreign banks operating in India in branch mode. Small finance banks, local area banks, payments banks, and regional rural banks are excluded from the framework.According to the draft, a bank can declare an equity dividend, or remit profits in the case of foreign bank branches, only if it meets all eligibility conditions. These include compliance with minimum regulatory capital requirements and buffers, including the additional buffer for domestic systemically important banks, at the end of the previous financial year and after the proposed dividend payout. Capital ratios must not fall below regulatory thresholds after the dividend is paid.Indian-incorporated banks must report a positive adjusted profit after tax for the year in which the dividend is proposed, calculated as profit after tax minus net NPAs. Foreign banks in branch mode must report positive profit after tax for the relevant period.If any of these conditions is not met, the bank cannot declare a dividend or remit profits for that period, and no special dispensation will be allowed.

NEW DELHI: Reliance Industries informed the BSE on Tuesday that there was no linkage between the fall in its share price and the news report on Russian oil imports, and that it had not purchased any crude from Russia for delivery in January.Bloomberg had earlier reported that at least three tankers carrying nearly 2.2 million barrels of Urals crude (a grade of Russian oil) were headed towards the Sikka port, from where RIL's Jamnagar refinery sources a significant portion of its oil imports.

After one of its strongest rallies in decades, gold prices may take a breather in 2026, though the long-term outlook remains firmly bullish, analysts at ICICI Direct said on Tuesday.The report noted that US Federal Reserve rate cuts are expected in 2026, ongoing concerns over rising global debt, and questions over long-term Fed independence will continue to make gold an attractive hedge against macroeconomic uncertainty.“Concerns over Fed independence will be supportive. There are fears in the market that next Fed chair candidate would push for lower interest rate,” the report said, as per news agency ANI.ICICI Direct expects strong downside protection for the metal, with prices unlikely to fall below the $3,500-3,600 range even during a corrective phase.On the upside, gold could test $4,800-5,000 if macroeconomic risks intensify or the dollar weakens further.Gold surged over 60% in 2025, reaching record highs as US rate cuts, aggressive central bank buying, geopolitical tensions, and concerns about US fiscal stability drove investors toward safe-haven assets.The sharp rise has made the metal vulnerable to short-term profit-taking, though analysts do not expect a significant correction.“Any moderation is likely if geopolitical risks ease or global trade tensions cool. Progress toward peace between Russia and Ukraine or stabilisation in US trade policy could reduce the risk premium embedded in gold prices,” the report said.Structural support for gold remains strong, underpinned by sustained central bank purchases, which have averaged roughly 1,000 tonnes annually since 2022.Gold is now emerging as the world’s second-largest reserve asset after the US dollar.Additionally, inflation concerns, high government debt, and rising investment in ETFs are expected to continue supporting prices, along with potential weakness in the dollar.While prices may moderate in 2026, gold’s role as a hedge and safe-haven asset is expected to remain strong.","Gold surged over 60% in 2025, reaching record highs as US rate cuts, aggressive central bank buying, geopolitical tensions, and concerns about US fiscal stability drove investors toward safe-haven assets.

China on Tuesday banned exports of dual-use goods that can serve both civilian and military purposes to Japan, a move that comes amid heightened tensions between the two countries over Taiwan.In a statement, China’s commerce ministry said exports of such items to Japanese military users, as well as to any other end-users that could help enhance Japan’s military power, are prohibited.It warned that any individual or organisation violating the rule by transferring or providing these made-in-China products to Japanese entities would face legal consequences, regardless of nationality.While the notice did not specify the items covered, some technology-related exports, including drones and navigation systems, could potentially be adapted for military use, as per news agency AP.There was no immediate response from Japan.China said the measures take effect immediately and are aimed at safeguarding national security and interests.Beijing classifies a range of products in sensitive sectors such as biotechnology, aerospace and telecommunications as dual-use goods subject to export controls.Relations between China and Japan have deteriorated in recent months over comments linked to Taiwan.Ties worsened after Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi said late last year that Japan’s military could get involved if China were to take action against Taiwan, the self-ruled island Beijing claims as its own territory.In December, Japan also said Chinese military aircraft locked radar on its fighter jets, despite what Tokyo described as a safe distance between them.China has stepped up military pressure around Taiwan, launching large-scale drills near the island last week.During that period, Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi criticised Japan’s leadership and Taiwan’s “pro-independence forces,” accusing Tokyo of challenging China’s territorial sovereignty.As per AFP, a Chinese commerce ministry spokesperson slammed Japan’s recent “erroneous remarks concerning Taiwan, implying the possibility of military intervention in the Taiwan Strait,” adding that the tightened export controls were necessary to protect China’s security interests.","China bans exports of dual-use goods that can serve both civilian and military purposes to Japan.

US economy outlook: Trump's tariffs spared Americans in 2025 — but how will 2026 feel?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-economy-outlook-trumps-tariffs-spared-americans-in-2025-but-how-will-2026-feel/articleshow/126370490.cms,"'Modi Knew I Was Not Happy, Can Raise Tariffs Quickly’: Trump Begins 2026 With Big Threat To India

Americans may have enjoyed some short-term relief in 2025, as President Donald Trump’s tariffs did not immediately drive up living costs. But for 2026 could bring a different picture, economists have warned, with prices expected to rise as businesses start passing the additional tariff costs on to consumers.Last year, United States collected $187 billion more in tariff revenue than the previous year, almost a 200% increase, according to CNN. Businesses bore most of this burden, covering roughly 80% of the cost. That figure, however, is expected to drop as companies transfer expenses to customers.“A lot of our clients really didn’t want to pass the costs on, but now they’re really having to,” Kyle Peacock, principal at Peacock Tariff Consulting said. He added that some firms implemented price increases at the start of the year, while others plan to raise prices later in the first or second quarter. Products with slim profit margins, including groceries, may be among the first to see increases.Businesses’ pricing decisions are further haunted by the last year's inventory strategies.Many firms stockpiled goods early in the year to avoid higher tariffs, which at one point reached 145% on Chinese imports.With those supplies running out, companies must now buy products with higher levies, which they can only absorb temporarily, according to CNN.Goldman Sachs economists estimated that tariffs added half a percentage point to inflation in 2025, proving US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s statement that tariffs accounted for all inflation above the 2% target.Goldman predicted a further three-tenths of a percentage point rise in inflation in the first six months of 2026.The rising costs place Trump in a difficult position ahead of the midterm elections: maintain tariffs or scale them back to ease the strain on households. The president has previously reversed tariff threats multiple times, leading to the acronym TACO, “Trump Always Chickens Out,” trending on Wall Street.As 2026 began, the US president has already delayed tariffs on furniture, cabinets, and Italian pasta. The White House gave little explanation for the pause, analysts suggest that it reflects the administration’s awareness of the political risks tariffs pose.There is one cushion that can protect Americans from price hikes. the Supreme Court case, that can strike down Trump’s broadest tariffs, which had raised $130 billion in revenue by 14 December. Peacock said businesses’ pricing choices will heavily depend on the court’s ruling, expected in the coming weeks.Trump has already rolled back several tariffs, on produce, furniture, cabinets, pasta, and has previously made exemptions for products including smartphones and auto parts, limiting the impact on American consumers.","Last year, United States collected $187 billion more in tariff revenue than the previous year, almost a 200% increase.

Here's what happened:



The win sounds sus...



Polymarket



What if someone knows what is about to happen and bets on it? This is just what many people are wondering after a mystery trader walked away with a payout of more than $436,000 from an online prediction market, after US announced the capture of Venezuela's former President, Nicolas Maduro, according to CBS news.An anonymous user on cryptocurrency-based prediction platform, Polymarket, placed a wager of roughly $32,000 on Maduro’s removal from power shortly before US President Donald Trump publicly announced that US forces had ousted the former Venezuelan leader. The timing of the bet has raised serious concerns among legal and financial experts about whether the trader may have had access to inside information, and what it means for the integrity of such platforms.The bettor, whose account appeared to have been created in December, staked $32,537 on the outcome that Maduro would be “out by January 31, 2026.” The speculative bet was placed just before Trump posted on Truth Social at 4.21 am on Saturday announcing Maduro’s arrest.That single wager ultimately paid out more than $436,000, according to market data, prompting scrutiny over whether the trade was placed with knowledge of a classified US operation to seize Maduro and his wife.The bettor had also placed many other bets surrounding Venezuela.Experts told CBS news that several red flags point to the possibility of insider knowledge.“It clearly suggests that the bettor did have access to inside information,” said Dennis Kelleher, co-founder and chief executive of Better Markets, a non-partisan financial reform advocacy group. “This particular bet has all the hallmarks of a trade based on inside information. It happened very late, right before the very event they were betting on happened; it was a relatively large amount of money; and it happened in a market that is not really regulated and where there is no transparency. ”The same Polymarket account also placed three additional wagers closely linked to US action against Venezuela: a $1,000 bet that the US would invade Venezuela by January 31; a $250 wager that Trump would invoke the War Powers Act against Venezuela by the same date; and a $146 bet predicting that US forces would land in Venezuela before the end of the month.“It was a new account only betting on issues around the Venezuelan president’s potential removal from office — there are a lot of telltale signs that make it seem like insider trading,” Stephen Piepgrass, a regulatory attorney at Troutman Pepper told CBS news.Polymarket, a New York-based prediction market that recently secured a $2 billion investment from stock exchange operator Intercontinental Exchange, did not respond to requests for comment on the Maduro-related wagers. The platform is currently seeking regulatory approval to operate in the United States.However, company chief executive Shayne Coplan has previously acknowledged that insiders can influence prediction markets. Speaking to CBS news he said that insiders “having an edge to the market is a good thing”.“Obviously, you need to curate them and you need to be really clear and stringent on where the line is drawn and, like, sort of ethics, and we spend a lot of time on that. But it’s sort of an inevitability that this will happen, and there’s a lot of benefits from it. And, you know, people will adapt,” he told 60 Minutes’ Anderson Cooper.The controversy has also drawn attention to the broader regulatory gaps surrounding prediction markets. Oversight of such platforms falls under the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), which also regulates similar services such as Kalshi.Legal experts told CBS news that the Maduro wager could potentially violate the Commodity Exchange Act, which governs futures and options trading and prohibits betting on events related to assassination, terrorism and war.Kelleher warned that the episode exposes broader risks for everyday users of prediction markets. “Consumers and investors should know that these are totally unregulated, non-transparent markets and that the odds of losing money are incredibly high,” he said.","An anonymous user placed a wager of roughly $32,000 on Maduro’s removal from power shortly before US President Donald Trump publicly announced that US forces had ousted the former Venezuelan leader.

"Samsung spotlights Galaxy Z TriFold at CES 2026, pitching a phone-tablet hybrid",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/samsung-spotlights-galaxy-z-trifold-at-ces-2026-pitching-a-phone-tablet-hybrid/articleshow/126364103.cms,"Samsung’s Galaxy Z TriFold emerged as another major attraction at First Look 2026 at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, with the company positioning the device as its latest step in foldable innovation — and a clear attempt to push the phone-tablet idea into a more practical, everyday form factor. Samsung’s pitch rests on the device’s dual personality: a conventional phone experience when closed, and a much larger screen when opened.While it is called a “tri fold,” it technically folds twice but has three panels, and the form factor is being described as a true phone-tablet hybrid that stands apart from bar-style smartphones. The emphasis, according to the inputs, is less on flashy claims and more on everyday utility — “its value appears to lie less in flashy specs about its thinness and more in its utility and practicality.”On physical design, the device is described as impressively slim when open: 3.9mm at its thinnest point and 4.2mm at its thickest , with a weight of 309 grams. When closed, however, the device is noted to be 12.9mm thick, described as “slightly chunky,” even as the cover display is said to feel close to using a non-folding phone.The story, as laid out in the inputs, is that this device is primarily about productivity on the go.The 6.5-inch cover display is positioned for typical phone use, while the 10-inch internal display is meant to provide enough screen real estate to “watch a movie, multitask or type up a paper.” That duality is being framed as the point — and as a niche Samsung believes still isn’t fully addressed by existing book-style foldables.Samsung’s rollout plan, as shared, is already in motion in parts of Asia and the Middle East. The Z TriFold is already available in Korea, China, Taiwan, Singapore and the United Arab Emirates. Samsung has also said it will launch in the US in the first quarter of this year, while India is yet to be announced.At the event, TM Roh — Chief Executive Officer, President, and Head of Device eXperience (DX) Division at Samsung Electronics — described the device as a direct response to a long-running industry challenge. He says, “Through years of innovation in foldable form factors, Galaxy Z TriFold solves one of the mobile industry’s longest-standing challenges — delivering the perfect balance between portability, premium performance, and productivity all in one device""The inputs also outline several headline hardware elements Samsung is attaching to the TriFold message: a 200 MP camera, and what is described as the biggest battery Samsung has ever had in a foldable phone. The battery is listed as a 5,600 mAh three-cell battery system, with the detail that it has been placed in each of the three panels of the device for balanced power deliver.Another key engineering detail highlighted is the hinge system. The TriFold uses two differently sized hinges with a dual-rail structure that “work in harmony.” Samsung is also pointing to the way the hinge design supports a slimmer profile, stating that the hinge structure allows the screen panels to meet securely with a minimal gap, enabling the device to be thin and portable.","Samsung’s Galaxy Z TriFold emerged as another major attraction at First Look 2026 at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas.

Lower demand for electric cars dents GM's sales,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/lower-demand-for-electric-cars-dents-gms-sales/articleshow/126363725.cms,"Tariff effect?

General Motors reported a dip in fourth-quarter US auto sales Monday, reflecting a sharp decline in electric vehicle transactions amid a broader slowing car market.But the US auto giant also achieved an annual sales increase, pointing to growth in pickups and crossovers sales as evidence of resonance with consumers despite offering lower incentives than the industry average.The Detroit giant reported 703,000 deliveries in the final quarter of 2025, a drop from the year prior of 6.9 percent, in a period characterized by tepid consumer confidence surveys.Other carmakers to report a drop in US sales in the fourth quarter included Honda, Nissan and Volkswagen, while Toyota and Stellantis were higher.Analysts at Cox Automotive had estimated a 4.7 percent drop in overall US car sales in the fourth quarter, with concerns about a weakening job market, high interest rates and cost-of-living pressures weighing on sentiment.A driver of GM's decline was a pronounced fall in EV sales from the third quarter, when consumers raced to take advantage of a $7,500 tax credit that expired at the end of September, earlier than initially intended due to legislation championed by US President Donald Trump.EV sales at GM were 25,219 in the October to December period, less than half the level in the third quarter of 2025.GM's annual sales were 2.8 million, up 5.5 percent from 2024.Among the vehicles with sizable gains were the Chevrolet Equinox, a small ""crossover"" sport utility vehicle and the GMC Sierra line of pickup trucks.""Demand for our brands and products is strong at every price point, and we are well-positioned to build on this momentum in the year ahead,"" said GM senior vice president Duncan Aldred.At Toyota, fourth-quarter sales rose about eight percent to 652,195, in line with annual growth of comparable percentage. Total sales were 2.5 million for 2025.Toyota models with significant year-over-year sales increases included the Grand Highlander SUV and Tacoma pickup.Stellantis, meanwhile, scored a four percent increase in the fourth-quarter to 332,321, helping to reduce the size of its annual drop after a number of weak quarters.Stellantis annual sales fell three percent to 1.3 million.""With consecutive quarterly sales increases and market share growth, it's clear that we are taking the right steps to reset our business in the US,"" said Jeff Kommor, head of US retail sales, who pointed to five new vehicle launches scheduled for 2026.Throughout 2025, automakers were faced with a fast-changing policy environment as Trump announced myriad tariff actions and moved to gut climate measures enacted under predecessor Joe Biden.Tariff costs did not lead to significant hikes in retail prices in 2025, in part because dealers were selling autos from inventory.However, analysts say consumers may see greater car price hikes in 2026 due to tariffs, potentially affecting demand.Cox estimates that US sales will come in at 15.8 million in 2026, or 2.4 percent below its projection for 2025 sales.","GM reports 703,000 deliveries in the final quarter of 2025, a drop from the year prior of 6.9 percent.

NEW DELHI: More than 1.14 lakh startups in India have created over 12 lakh jobs so far, the finance ministry said in its latest review of the Indian economy.In the report titled, ‘The Indian Economy: A Review January 2024’, the Department of Economic Affairs said that the 1.14 lakh startups recognised by the government under the 'Startup India initiative’ created more than 12 lakh jobs (as of October 2023).The state-owned e-commerce platform Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) clocked more than 63 lakh transactions till November 2023, the document read.Despite facing global challenges in 2023 like valuation issues, few IPOs, regulatory changes and macroeconomic and geopolitical trends, India remains the third largest tech start-up ecosystem globally, with over 950 tech startups founded last year.The cumulative funding for more than 31,000 tech start ups has exceeded $70 billion (from 2019 to 2023), according to a recent report by Nasscom in collaboration with Zinnov.“In 2023, despite facing global economic and regulatory challenges, Indian tech startups have prioritised the imperative of enhancing their business fundamentals, driving profitability and growth,” said Debjani Ghosh, President, Nasscom.“The proliferation of tech startups in tier 2 and 3 cities marks the ecosystem's resilience,” she added.Navigating 2024, tech startup founders expect to continue the revenue growth path with measured steps focusing on optimising expenditure and maximising profitability for B2B tech startups.Investments in deeptech will continue an upward trend in 2024.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Startups will play important role in helping India become 3rd largest economy: CEA Nageswaran,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/startups-will-play-important-role-in-helping-india-become-3rd-largest-economy-cea-nageswaran/articleshow/105332523.cms,"Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran





THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor (CEA) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran Udaan until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.Udaan built an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business still accounts for a very small part of India’s overall retail market but can balloon to $150 billion in sales and yield a 100% return on capital invested in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co. estimates published in the Mint newspaper.Bengaluru-based Udaan has also ventured into financing through its fintech unit which helps shopkeepers get working capital loans to buy inventory. That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says.

How India's GDP has been growing

What SBI report said on savings and investment

Incremental capital output ratio

NEW DELHI: India's gross domestic product (GDP) data for the third quarter (October-December 2022) received a word of caution from the former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan In an interview with news agency PTI, Rajan that India is ""dangerously close"" to the Hindu rate of growth in view of subdued private sector investment, high interest rates and slowing global growth.India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying"".However, a report released by the State Bank of India (SBI) economists on Tuesday dismissed arguments that India is dangerously close to Hindu rate of growth saying such statements are ""ill-conceived, biased and premature"".The term 'Hindu growth rate' was coined by late economist Raj Krishna in 1978 to describe the slow growth in the country.It basically refers to the low pace of economic growth rates during 1950s to 1980s. During this period, the Indian economy averaged 3.5%.A former lecturer at the Delhi School of Economics (DSE), Krishna noted that only if the rate of growth is persistently slow and accompanied by low per-capita GDP, then it will be known as Hindu rate of growth but it has to factor in population growth as well.Before economic reforms of 1991, India's economic growth remained stagnant and low, while per capita income averaged around 1.3%.Krishna termed this low growth situation to be a result of socialist policies of state control and import substitution.However, the economic situation changed when liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation (LPG) reforms came into effect in the year 1991, at a time when India faced balance of payment crisis.Over the years, many economists have strongly opposed the idea of 'Hindu growth rate' and the term never had universal acceptance.The Indian economy plunged into its very first technical recession in FY21 due to the impact of Covid-19 pandemic and the related nationwide lockdowns. GDP shrunk by an unprecedented 23.8% in the first quarter of the financial year 2020-21. However, due to spurt in economic activities in the subsequent quarters, the GDP decline started to narrow.However, if we look at the period before Covid-19 as well, India's growth curve shows a declining trend.From 8.26% in FY17, GDP growth plunged to 3.74% in FY20. Shutdown of economic activities in FY21 in wake of Covid-19 only made matters worse.As lockdowns started to ease and business activities resumed, India's GDP also started rising. In Q1 of FY22, growth jumped to 20.1% mainly on account of low base effect. By the fourth quarter of FY22, growth came down to 4.10%.Similarly, the new financial year 2022-23 brought fresh economic challenges in the form of Russia-Ukraine war that impacted almost all major economies of the world, slowed the pace of growth, pushed inflation to record highs.As a result, the central banks of all advanced economies spurred into action and opted for monetary policy tightening to curb the soaring inflation.With persistently rising interest rates, India's economy grew by 4.4% in Q3 of FY23, as the Centre revised upwards GDP growth for previous year to 9.10% from 8.7% earlier.The report weighed recent GDP numbers against the available data on savings and investments for the past decade and highlighted some interesting points.""Quarterly growth numbers are noisy and should be best avoided for any serious interpretation (on an average, India's GDP growth has witnessed Rs 2 lakh crore upward revision for the 3 year ended FY23),"" the report said.Gross capital formation (GCF) by the government touched a high of 11.8% in 2021-22, up from 10.7% in 2020-21.""This also had a domino effect on private sector investment that jumped from 10 per cent to 10.8% over the same period,"" it said.In fact, Ecowrap added that the trends in GCF to gross output ratio or the plough back of funds for creation of fresh capacity shows that for public administration the ratio attained fresh peak in 2021-22 owing to the emphasis on capital expenditure in recent budgets.At the aggregate level, gross capital formation is supposed to have crossed 32% in 2022-23, the highest level since 2018-19.According to the report, in 2021-22, gross savings have risen to 30% from 29% in 2020-21.""The ratio is supposed to have crossed 31 per cent in 2022-23, the highest since 2018-19. The household savings increased sharply during the pandemic period on account of sharp accretion in financial savings such as deposits,"" said the report by SBI's Economic Research Department.While household financial savings have since then moderated from 15.4% in 2020-21 to 11.1% in 2022-23, savings in physical assets have grown sharply to 11.8% in 2021-22 from 10.7% in 2020-21.The report further analysed Incremental Capital Output ratio (ICOR) -- which measures additional units of capital (investment) needed to produce additional units of output. It said that the ratio has been improving.""ICOR which was 7.5 in FY 12 is now only 3.5 in FY22. Clearly, only half of capital is now needed for next unit of output,"" the report noted.Such reducing ICOR in the current years reflects a relatively increasing efficiency of capital and shows that the economy is on a sound footing, the report said.""From that point of view, future GDP growth rates even at 7% could still mean a decent number by any standards!,"" it added.","India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.

An employee is entitled for a 50 per cent amount of the last drawn salary as pension.OPS was discontinued by the NDA government in 2003 with effect from April 1, 2004.Under the new pension scheme (NPS), employees contribute 10 per cent of their basic salary towards pension while the government contributes 14 per cent.Governments of Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand have informed the central government/ Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA about their decision to restart OPS for their employees.The government of Punjab on November 18, 2022, issued a notification regarding implementation of OPS for the state government employees who are being covered under NPS. Jharkhand too has decided to revert to OPS.",Former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan has expressed his concern over the decision of some states to restart the old pension scheme.

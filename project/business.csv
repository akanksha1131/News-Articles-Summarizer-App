Income Tax Department Crackdown

Income Tax Department’s extensive crackdown! Over the past 20 months, the Income Tax Department has collected Rs 37,000 crore from individuals who had taxable income but failed to file returns, according to officials.Officials analysed data on substantial transactions since 2019-20, including purchases of gems, jewellery, property and luxury holidays paid in cash. ""These are the cases where people were not filing tax returns despite making large purchases. The department had reached out to them over the past 20 months,"" a senior official informed ET.The official noted that an expanded and stricter tax collection and TDS system has helped identify significant transactions that previously went unnoticed.The official indicated that some individuals submitted returns claiming zero income despite substantial expenditure and tax obligations. From the total Rs 37,000 crore recovered, Rs 1,320 crore came from individuals involved in high-value transactions.The department is conducting an extensive initiative to contact taxpayers whose spending patterns do not align with their declared income.Since FY21, it has actively used data analytics and the Non-Filer Monitoring System to identify non-compliant individuals.""Data from multiple sources is being tapped and synchronised... This makes it easy for the department to identify such evasion and nab evaders,"" the official stated.Official data revealed that direct tax collections for April-November increased by 15.4% to Rs 12.10 lakh crore, comprising Rs 5.10 lakh crore in corporate tax and Rs 6.61 lakh crore in non-corporate tax.","Officials analysed data on substantial transactions since 2019-20, including purchases of gems, jewellery, property and luxury holidays paid in cash.

"ITR filing deadline: Don’t miss December 31, 2024 deadline for revised, belated tax returns",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/itr-filing-deadline-dont-miss-december-31-2024-deadline-for-revised-belated-tax-returns-here-are-the-consequences/articleshow/116495382.cms,"If one fails to submit a belated return by December 31, 2024, specific consequences apply.

ITR filing: What are the consequences of missing the belated return filing deadline on December 31, 2024?



ITR filing: What if you miss the revised return filing December 31, 2024 deadline?

ITR filing deadline : December 31, 2024, marks the final deadline for submitting belated and revised income tax returns for FY 2023-24 (AY 2024-25). Whilst various taxpayer categories have distinct ITR filing deadlines, the final date for belated and revised returns remains the same. Many individuals remain unaware of the implications of missing the December 31, 2024, submission deadline for FY 2023-24.If one fails to submit a belated return by December 31, 2024, specific consequences apply.Under Section 139(4) of the Income Tax Act, belated returns incur a Rs 5,000 penalty, regardless of outstanding tax amounts. A reduced penalty of Rs 1,000 applies for lower taxable income. However, individuals with income below the Rs 3 lakh basic exemption limit face no penalties.Kinjal Bhuta, Secretary of Bombay Chartered Accountants' Society, told ET, ""Belated return is the last chance for the taxpayer to file the ITR and claim refunds and certain losses. If the belated return is not filed, the person misses those claims and credits for that assessment year. After the expiry of the filing of the belated return, only an updated return can be filed subject to the condition that there is a tax liability payable. Further, if no belated return is filed, the taxpayer shall have to face increased interests and penalties on the tax liabilities if a notice is sent by the income tax department.""A significant limitation of filing belated returns for FY 2023-24 is the inability to select the old tax regime , as the new regime became default from April 1, 2023. Consequently, belated returns must follow the new tax regime .Also Read | Avoid Rs 10 lakh income tax penalty! Why it's important to report foreign income, assets in ITR by December 31, 2024 - check details The old tax regime offered various deductions and exemptions unavailable in the new tax regime. These provisions helped reduce taxable income and subsequent tax obligations.The new regime permits only two deductions: a standard deduction of Rs 50,000 for FY 2023-24 (AY 2024-25) and employer NPS contributions up to 10% of basic salary. Additional benefits like Section 80C, 80D, and HRA exemptions are not applicable under the new structure.When a taxpayer needs to rectify errors in original or belated returns, they must submit a revised return. This allows corrections of various oversights, such as unreported income, unclaimed deductions, or omitted bank account details.Bhuta says, ""If the taxpayer misses the deadline to file a revised return, there is no other mechanism to file a revised return again for that assessment year and to claim refunds or losses. The income tax laws allow the filing of an updated return. However, the updated return cannot be filed in cases where the taxpayer has losses, it results in an increased refund, or the tax return has an effect of reducing the total tax liability as filed in the original or belated return. There are many other criteria as to when an updated return cannot be filed. So, if a taxpayer misses the revised return deadline, the only way in which any additional claim or credit can be requested is during the assessment proceedings. However, that is subject to litigation.""Also Read | PAN 2.0: How to easily apply for PAN Card reprint with QR code - check 6 simple steps online Whilst taxpayers can submit multiple revised returns, tax experts advise against frequent revisions as this could trigger scrutiny from the Income Tax Department.Regarding intimation notices, Bhuta explains, ""As per section 139(5) of the Income Tax Act, 1961, ITR can be revised only before three months before the end of the relevant assessment year or before the completion of assessment, whichever event happens first. The ITR can be revised even after an intimation has been received under section 143(1). However, once the ITR is processed under a regular scrutiny assessment under section 143(3), the same cannot be revised.""For the financial year 2023-24 (AY 2024-25), taxpayers have until December 31, 2024, to submit their revised returns.","December 31, 2024, marks the final deadline for submitting belated and revised income tax returns for FY 2023-24 (AY 2024-25) If one fails to submit a belated return by December 31, 2016, specific consequences apply. The old tax regime offered various deductions and exemptions unavailable in the new tax regime.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116496929,imgsize-50318,width-400,resizemode-4/116496929.jpg"

Elon Musk-led Tesla has recommenced its search for showroom locations in New Delhi, according to two sources who spoke to Reuters, indicating a potential reconsideration of its Indian market entry after previously suspending investment plans this year.Following a temporary pause in its Indian showroom search, Tesla has now initiated preliminary discussions with DLF regarding space in the capital region, according to two sources with direct knowledge of the developments.According to one source, Tesla seeks 3,000 to 5,000 square feet for a customer experience centre, plus additional space triple that size for service and delivery operations.The company is considering various locations, including DLF's Avenue Mall in southern Delhi and the Cyber Hub complex in Gurugram.Earlier this year, Elon Musk indicated plans to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi and potentially announce a $2-3 billion investment in India.

There is no change in the tax rate of popcorn and the GST Council has only agreed that the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) will issue a circular clarifying the current taxation regime of popcorn.However, opposition politicians, economists and government supporters expressed their disapproval while others responded with humour and satire.""Complexity is a bureaucrat's delight and citizens' nightmare,"" said former Chief Economic Adviser K V Subramanian on X, questioning the decision's value given its minimal revenue impact and public inconvenience.Additionally, his predecessor Arvind Subramanian, criticised the move for increasing complexity rather than simplifying the system, mentioning issues with enforcement and rationality.Meanwhile, Congress party leader and spokesman Jairam Ramesh criticised the ""absurdity of three different tax slabs for popcorn under GST"", saying how it exemplifies the increasing complexity of what was intended to be a straightforward tax system.","GST Council proposed 5% GST for non-branded popcorn with salt and spices, 12% for pre-packaged and branded varieties, and 18% for caramel popcorn, classified under sugar confectionery.

In addition to unsecured loans, RBI has also raised concerns about top-up loans on gold loans, stating they could present similar risks to unsecured loans. RBI noted that these loans ""could lead to a buildup of risks, especially during times when collateral for such loans becomes volatile or faces cyclical downturns.""In light of these concerns, RBI had instructed that all top-up loans extended by regulated entities (REs) against movable assets - which are inherently depreciating in nature - should be treated as unsecured loans for credit appraisal, prudential limits, and exposure purposes.Another area of concern for RBI is private credit. Acknowledging the trend of shifting from formal lenders to private credit, RBI said, ""A closer look is, however, warranted at the interlinkages between regulated entities, including banks and NBFCs, and such firms.

Foreign institutional investors continued to stay cautious, refraining from taking long positions in Indian markets, which kept the rupee subdued.

In the near term, the rupee is expected to trade within a range of 85-85.45,"" Jateen Trivedi, VP (research analyst) at LKP Securities, said.The dollar has gained over the rupee in the past two months.

The Real Effective Exchange Rate is an index that tracks how the rupee's value compares to other currencies by looking at how they move against the dollar. It has increased because other currencies have weakened less than the rupee.Dealers say that the rupee could face further downward pressure as global economic uncertainties and domestic macroeconomic challenges continue to weigh on market sentiment. RBI's interventions are expected to provide some support, but sustained dollar strength poses significant challenges for the rupee in the coming months.The dollar has strengthened on the back of rising bond yields in the US and expectations that the Federal Reserve will introduce its interest rate cuts more slowly in 2025.

JSW, say sources, is betting aggressively on the Indian EV industry and is interested in launching multiple EV lineups including passenger and commercial vehicles. ""Eventually JSW is also looking to launch its own EV lineup,"" said a top auto executive close to SAIC. When contacted, the company spokesman said ""JSW will not comment on the story"". When contacted MG India officials refused to comment.Auto industry sources however say the main reason for JSW looking at other auto partnerships has to do with its aggressive ambitions in the auto sector. ""The SAIC-JSW partnership is not exclusive which means JSW is free to seek more partnerships depending upon the vehicle segments it wants to have a presence in,"" said the top auto executive. The fact that SAIC did not offer JSW majority stake in MG could also be a sticking point, he said.Currently, JSW Group owns 35% stake in the company while private equity fund Everstone Capital has 8% stake and another 8% is owned by MG dealers and employees. SAIC holds the remaining 49%. The joint venture between JSW and SAIC - JSW MG Motor India - was formed in 2023. There have been reports about JSW increasing its stake to 51% in the run up to listing JSW MG Motor India but the company has not confirmed the news.

A spokesperson was not immediately available to respond to a query. “For Chatterjee to fully exit will take some time given how he is tied up across several Ola group of companies,” another source added.Chatterjee, formerly Flipkart's design lead, was Ola Electric's CTPO since 2021. He was responsible for building Ola Krutrim and Ola Maps in significant capacities – products that Aggarwal touted as disrupters to Microsoft and Google respectively earlier in the year. A BITS Pilani graduate, Chatterjee first began work with Aggarwal in 2017 as Ola's mainstay cab business' head of design. In 2021, he was promoted to chief product officer, and in 2022, he became its chief technology and product officer.Aggarwal’s co-founder at Ola and former chief technology officer Ankit Bhati quit the firm in 2019. In October this year, Ola Electric also lost another key management personnel, Pramendra Tomar, its company secretary and compliance officer, who resigned citing personal reasons and commitments. Ola Electric added that it is in the process of appointing a new candidate for the position of company secretary. The company said then that it was in the process of hiring a replacement. Sources told TOI that a replacement has not been found yet.The back-to-back resignations add to many similar instances at the company over recent years, now more so after the EV maker’s shares struggle at the stock exchanges with its price dipping below the Rs 100 mark over the months. The stock closed at Rs 93.30, down about a percent, on the NSE on Thursday.","Chief Technology and Product Officer Suvonil Chatterjee called it quits, sources familiar with the matter told TOI. He was responsible for building Ola Krutrim and Ola Maps in significant capacities.

He reiterated that the Tata Group will create five lakh manufacturing jobs in the next five years in facilities that produce batteries, semiconductors, electric vehicles, solar equipment, and other critical hardware.In an year-end letter to employees, Chandrasekaran said that manufacturing has the potential to transform India's economy. ""What might have seemed like a short-term reaction to the pandemic has proved much more enduring. Amid relentless geopolitical instability, the equation has tilted firmly toward resilience - and India, with our vast talent pool and growing manufacturing capacity - is poised to benefit,"" he said.Observing that the great trends of the age are in favour of India, Chandrasekaran said that he looks ahead to 2025 with optimism. ""Though it is difficult to begin a new year without Mr (Ratan) Tata, there is comfort in knowing that the business he devoted his life to continues to thrive. Big strategic bets, made with his encouragement, are bearing fruit, particularly in hi-tech industries and manufacturing where our footprint continues to expand,"" he said.In the letter, he also said that over seven new manufacturing facilities were initiated - including India's first semiconductor fab in Dholera, Gujarat, and a semiconductor OSAT plant in Assam. Other facilities include an electronics assembly plant in Karnataka, an automotive plant in Tamil Nadu, and new MRO facilities in Bengaluru. Battery manufacturing factories were also launched in Gujarat and Somerset, UK, alongside solar module production in Tamil Nadu.He highlighted key achievements across the group including TCS and Tejas Networks delivering the first indigenous 4G telecom stack for BSNL and advancing to 5G.

IndusInd looks to sell Rs 1.5k crore microfinance NPAs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/indusind-looks-to-sell-rs-1-5k-crore-microfinance-npas/articleshow/116692863.cms,"MUMBAI: IndusInd Bank has decided to auction Rs 1,573 crore of non-performing microfinance loans in a bid to clean up its balance sheet. The bank has set a reserve price of Rs 85 crore, indicating that it has written down nearly 95% of the value of these loans.Meanwhile, IndusInd Bank promoters - IndusInd International Holdings (IIHL) and IndusInd (IL) - on Thursday said they have pledged an additional 2.78% of the bank's shares worth Rs 2,000 crore. This brings the total percentage of the bank's share capital pledged by the promoters to 6.86%. The shares were pledged on Dec 20, 2024, in favour of Barclays Bank and Deutsche Bank AG, London branch. The reason for the encumbrance is to top-up the security placed with the lenders for an existing loan facility.Ashok Hinduja, director of the Hinduja Group, had stated that IndusInd International Holdings has received RBI approval to raise its stake in the bank to 26%. IIHL had also won the bid to acquire Reliance Capital under the insolvency route, for which it is raising funds.Bankers said that recovery prospects in MFI loans that have gone into default are low given that these are unsecured loans. Given the small size of the loans, legal proceedings are not justified.In the bank's Q2 earnings call, MD & CEO Sumant Kathpalia had mentioned that the bank was shrinking its microfinance book due to stress in the sector and the increased risk weightage introduced by RBI. He added that the MFI exposure had reduced the capital adequacy following RBI's increase in risk weights on microfinance loans from 75% to 125%. Of total advances of Rs 1.9 lakh crore, IndusInd Bank's microfinance portfolio stood at Rs 32,723 crore - accounting for a 9% share of its loan book.""Our disbursements in Q1 were around Rs 8,500 crore, and in Q2, they stood at Rs 7,050 crore, against our average run rate of around Rs 12,000-13,000 crore. As a consequence, our book ran down because the repayments are coming in higher than disbursements,"" Kathpalia said. He added that while disbursements were expected to improve in the current quarter, they would still be lower than the disbursement potential, as the bank was watchful of developments in the industry.In its investor presentation, the bank had stated that gross non-performing assets stood at Rs 2,259 crore, up from Rs 1,988 crore at the end of the first quarter. The NPAs in the microfinance sector at the end of the first half accounted for 42% of total gross NPAs of Rs 5,356 crore.","IndusInd Bank has decided to auction Rs 1,573 crore of non-performing microfinance loans in a bid to clean up its balance sheet.

RBI policies may have contributed to economic slowdown: Finance ministry,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/rbi-policies-may-have-contributed-to-eco-slowdown-finance-ministry/articleshow/116692791.cms,"Representative image.

NEW DELHI: The combination of monetary policy stance and macroprudential measures by the central bank, and structural factors, may have contributed to slowdown in demand, a finance ministry report said on Thursday in the latest sign of divergent views between North Block and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) over growth and inflation. This is the first official comment from the ministry about the slowdown, which appears to put part of the blame on RBI.Growth slumped to a seven quarter low of 5.4% in the July-Sept and pressure piled on RBI to cut rates to revive growth, while the central bank maintained its focus on containing inflation and preferred to hold rates for the 11th consecutive time in Dec, citing stubborn inflation. Slowing urban consumption has also worried policymakers battling to put growth back on track.""...There are good reasons to believe that the outlook for growth in H2 (second half) of FY25 is better than what we have seen in H1 (first half). At the same time, the possibility that structural factors may also have contributed to the slowdown in H1 should not be ruled out,"" the finance ministry's monthly economic report said, appreciating the central bank's move to lower the cash reserve ratio (CRR) from 4.5% to 4% in its policy meeting in Dec 2024.The move, the report said should help boost credit growth, which has slowed a little too much and quickly in financial year 2024-25. It also stressed that hiring and compensation practices in the corporate sector have also played their part in slowing down growth in urban consumption.There are expectations that RBI may cut rates in Feb under a new-look monetary policy and a new governor Sanjay Malhotra, former revenue secretary who replaced Shaktikanta Das earlier this month but some experts have said that a rate reduction in Feb may prove tricky against the backdrop of global uncertainties.Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman had earlier said that a slowdown in govt spending during April-June quarter was due to general elections and was hopeful of a pick-up from the current quarter. The report asserted that growth in the current fiscal year would be 6.5% but cautioned about newer uncertainties emerging on the global stage.""Global trade growth is looking more uncertain than before. Elevated stock markets continue to pose a big risk. The strength of US dollar and a rethink on the path of policy rates in the US have put emerging market currencies under pressure,"" said the report prepared by the department of economic affairs. ""In turn, that will make monetary policymakers in these countries think more deeply about the path of policy rates. Recent exchange rate movements may have lowered their degrees of freedom. In sum, sustaining growth will require a deeper commitment from all economic stakeholders to growth,"" it added.Stating that inflationary pressures softened in Nov 2024, driven by lower food and core inflation, the report said that an influx of fresh produce in the market has moderated vegetable price pressures.","Growth slumped to a seven quarter low of 5.4% in the July-Sept.

Wife had promised to pay Rs 5L ‘supari’ for MLC kin’s murder

PUNE: Police on Wednesday arrested Mohini Wagh (48) on the charge of a key role in the conspiracy to abduct and murder her husband, Satish Sadba Wagh (55), a farmer and businessman from Manjari and BJP MLC Yogesh Tilekar ’s uncle.“The crime branch arrested Wagh around 5.30pm on Wednesday after investigations established her role in the conspiracy to eliminate her husband.

Additional commissioner of police (crime) Shailesh Balkawade told TOI, “Wagh’s name figured during the custodial interrogation of Akshay Jawalkar (29), who was arrested on Dec 11 along with three others. He was Satish’s former tenant. Jawalkar said she had promised to pay Rs5 lakh as ‘supari’ (contract) to him and the assailants to eliminate her husband.”Balkawade cited investigations and said, “Wagh planned to get rid of her husband as the latter suspected her of allegedly having an affair with Jawalkar. We will verify if she actually paid money to Jawalkar and oth-ers held in the crime.”Satish was abducted by five men in a car from a spot near hotel Blueberry at Manjari Farms in the Hadapsar area around 6am on Dec 9.

Citizens & social groups carry out protests, demand death rap



KALYAN: The Thane police on Wednesday arrested Vishal Gawli (35) and his wife Sakshi Gawli (25) for the rape and murder of a 13-year-old girl who went missing from Kalyan on Dec 23.Thane police, who had formed six teams to investigate the case, contacted the Buldhana police, who caught Gawli from a salon where he was trying to change his look to avoid being identified and caught.A team from Thane police then went to Buldhana to bring him back.According to the Thane police, Gawli kidnapped the girl from near her house on Monday and took her to his house, where he raped and killed her. After the murder, he called his wife, who was in the bank, and threatened to leave her if she did not support him and help him in disposing of the body.Police said that in Dec last year, a man had molested the 13-year-old girl, and when she disappeared on Monday, the family as well as the police first suspected him.However, the investigation revealed that man was not involved in the matter.Police said Gawli has three cases of molestation, including one of a minor girl, and two cases of assault lodged against him. He was out on bail in the last Pocso case registered against him in Aug last year. He had married three times and Sakshi is his third wife, the police said.Police said CCTV footage from Bhiwandi showed that after Gawli dumped the body, he bought alcohol at a restaurant in the area.The probe has revealed that owing to the conduct of the accused, the 13-year-old’s family used to forbid her from going to his house, but as the girl had a good relationship with Gawli’s wife, she would sometimes go there.The police are still investigating how Gawli took the girl to his house when his wife was away. They suspect that he killed the girl fearing she would tell people about the sexual assault.The police have seized the autorickshaw used in the crime and are checking if the rickshaw driver was also involved in it as an accomplice.Kalyan Lok Sabha MP Shrikant Shinde, son of depuyty CM Eknath Shinde, met the girl’s family and gave them an assurance that the government would make every effort to ensure the accused got the death penalty in the case.The incident came to light on Monday evening. At 4.30 pm that day, the girl went out to buy some food items. When she did not return until 7 in the evening, her mother began a search for her.She was still not found until 11 pm, at which hour the mother contacted the father of the girl, who was outside. The parents, after searching for her in the area, lodged a case of kidnapping at the local Kolsewadi police station.While the police began their search for the girl, on Tuesday morning, the Padgha police in Bhiwandi found her body on the Kalyan-Padgha road, after which the girl’s family identified her.Angry over the rape and murder of the 13-year-old girl, public representatives and residents of Kalyan took out separate rallies on Wednesday to the Kolsewadi police station and demanded that the accused be hanged.Many social organisations in the city, under the leadership of former Shiv Sena functionary Mahesh Gaikwad, took out a rally with participants wearing black ribbons around their arms to demand justice for the girl. Social worker Shailesh Tiwari also held a protest.Shiv Sena workers also went to the police station and demanded that the accused be given maximum punishment. Former Kalyan city president of the Shiv Sena Nilesh Shinde said that the accused in this case should be hanged so that no one can commit such a heinous crime in the future.Kalyan Lok Sabha MP Shrikant Shinde met the victim’s family and gave an assurance that the govt would make every effort to ensure that the accused gets the death penalty in this case.","Thane police arrest Vishal Gawli and his wife Sakshi Gawli for the rape and murder of a 13-year-old girl.

A rally in the group that has led Wall Street ’s gains in 2024 lifted stocks in a relatively quiet session ahead of Christmas.Following a strong day for big tech, the shares continued to power ahead on Tuesday. Tesla Inc. led megacaps higher. Broadcom Inc. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. climbed as President Joe Biden’s team launched a probe into Chinese-made chips. In a shortened pre-holiday session, the S&P 500“The action of the past few weeks shows that the big-cap tech names are still the key leadership group in today’s stock market,” said Matt Maley at Miller Tabak. “These big-tech names are highly overweighted in the portfolios of a huge number of institutional investors. Any buying they do over the next week is likely to be concentrated in these names.”Equity investors are also hoping for what’s known as the “Santa Claus Rally,” in which stocks rise during the final five trading sessions of a year and the first two of the new one. This time around that window started Tuesday.“Santa Claus rally could still be alive, with strong seasonality into the end of the year,” said London Stockton at Ned Davis Research.Since 1950, the S&P 500 has generated average and median returns of 1.3% during this period, widely outpacing the market’s average seven-day gain of 0.3%, according to Adam Turnquist at LPL Financial.“When investors are on the ‘nice’ list, and Santa delivers a ‘positive’ Santa Claus Rallyreturn, the S&P 500 has generated an average January and forward annual return of 1.4% and 10.4%, respectively,” he said.The S&P 500 rose 1.1%. The Nasdaq 100 added 1.4%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.9%.The yield on 10-year Treasuries was little changed at 4.59%. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index barely budged.While a positive “Santa Claus Rally” has preceded a 10.4% average annual gain for the S&P 500 since World War II, Sam Stovall at CFRA says a more accurate indicator in his view is the “January Barometer.”That’s a market hypothesis positing that January’s performance predicts the year’s performance. The term was coined by Yale Hirsch, creator of the Stock Trader’s Almanac, in 1972.Since 1945, when the year started with a gain in January, the S&P 500 rose an average of 18.3% in price during the entire year, Stovall at CFRA said. If the first month saw a decline in price, however, the average full-year return was negative 1.9%.With the market up over 25% this year and no corrections of more than 10%, the S&P 500 has managed to stay solidly above its 200-day moving average for the entirety of 2024, noted Bespoke Investment Group strategists.“Barring a significant market selloff in the last few trading days of the year, this will be the 12th year since 1952 (when we went to the current 5-day trading week at the NYSE) that the S&P has traded above its 200-DMA all year,” they said.The average next-year change following these years has been a gain of just 4.6% compared to the average gain of 9.2% for all years, Bespoke noted.Last week, Bank of America Corp. clients were large net buyers of US equities, according to strategist Jill Carey Hall. They bought American shares for the seventh consecutive week.Similar to the prior five weeks, clients bought both single stocks and exchange-traded funds, with bigger inflows into the former, she noted. Flows were primarily in large caps.Investors should have a more-balanced approach in US stocks over the first quarter, according to Citigroup Inc. strategists led by Scott Chronert, who see a greater opportunity in defensive sectors.They raised health care to overweight, noting valuations are now lower and fundamentals seem close to inflection point. Meantime, they are selective on growth stocks, looking for stronger fundamental trend versus valuation and potential margin improvement.Citi’s strategists are overweight in media, internet and semiconductors, while raising software to market weight.",The S&P 500 rose 1.1%.

The battle of the top performing L1 blockchains has been pretty wild this year, with the likes of ETH, SOL, TRX, BNB, Toncoin (TON) and Cardano (ADA) fighting to claim the leadership mantle. However, out of all these networks, TON blockchain is showing huge promise as it records approximately 200% gains.Conversely, Cardano network is also making waves, especially as its new Hydra scalability solution is set to potentially unlock 1 million TPS. On the other hand, predictions about a fast-rising presale star– Lunex Network (LNEX) are blowing up as it shows the potential of overthrowing TON and ADA in 2025.Over the past year and counting, TON blockchain has been widely popular for one major thing— blockchain lucrative games. The partnership between Toncoin and Telegram to bring mini-games to millions of users was a very profitable one.From launching several tap-to-earn games to furthering its expansion in P2E games, Toncoin has been able to rack up approximately 200% NET gains . As experts rank Toncoin (TON) alongside cryptos to buy , analysts are starting to give bullish predictions.Although TON price is currently down by 11% as it trades within a weekly range of $6.6 and $5.9, the network is still receiving positive sentiment. X aanalyst, Crypto King particularly sighted a short term prediction of $10 for Toncoin. While this may seem far-fetched from the current price, the token’s 50, 100, and 200 moving averages points at a strong buy.Since its founder, Charles Hoskinson met up with President Donald Trump for the sake of enhancing crypto adoption, Cardano has been buzzing alongside otherDeFi coins . Cardano price now sits at a weekly range of $$0.98 and $1.28, 70% jump from its price in the past month. However experts believe this is just the starting.During a recent Cardano market dip, whales took the opportunity to accumulate 130 million ADA token, signaling huge bullish sentiment and strong confidence. Owing to this several investors are positive for Cardano network.Ali Martinez, a seasoned crypto analyst and expert has sparked more optimism recently. In a very recent tweet. Ali emphasized on how he will keep buying ADA even if it dips to $0.7 as he expects a further surge to $4 or $6 for Cardano.As a fast, secure and non-custodial DeFi project with robust features to facilitate effortless cross chain transactions, it won’t be surprising for Lunex Network (LNEX) to challenge top DeFi coins. The new altcoin project has already accumulated over $5.4 million in revenue after selling over 2.3 billion of its presale supply. Such buying interest only speaks of its potential to deliver immeasurable returns when it launches on DEX platforms.However, asides the numbers, Lunex Network has more growth potential embedded in its ecosystem and practical use. For starters, the platform allows investors to swap up to 50,000 cryptocurrencies across multi chains by connecting isolated blockchains together. Additionally, users can invest in its LNEX tokens and earn up to 18% APY in passive income when they engage in its staking pool.Furthermore, there’s a reward system where the platform gives half of its revenue to users while preserving the other half for more exclusive rewards. Alongside this, Lunex Network helps investors track their portfolio while delivering updated market insights. The platform also grants cashback rewards on every transaction, allowing users to earn more by actively using the network. With over 300% spike, its LNEX token is now valued at $0.0048 from an initial $0.0012.The practical uses and diversity that Lunex Network brings as an exchange platform is enough to contend with the likes of Toncoin. Although TON has seen huge developments as a mothering network to several other cryptocurrencies, Lunex Network’s intricate design catered for crypto investors, business owners and Web3 development makes it stand out as a tough contender. This put LNEX token on the radar of top cryptos to buy.You can find more information about Lunex Network (LNEX) here:Website: https://lunexnetwork.com Socials: https://linktr.ee/lunexnetwork","Lunex Network (LNEX) is primed for a staggering growth above most DeFi coins. TON blockchain is showing huge promise as it records approximately 200% gains.

They plans to finalise a merger agreement by June and complete the transaction, including listing the holding company on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, by August 2026.Japanese automotive manufacturers have fallen behind major competitors in electric vehicle development and are seeking cost reductions while attempting to recover lost ground.Earlier this month, speculation emerged about potential collaboration, with unconfirmed reports suggesting that discussions were partially influenced by Taiwan's Foxconn's interest in acquiring Renault SA's Nissan shares.Meanwhile, Nissan's chief executive Makoto Uchida confirmed no direct communication from Foxconn, while acknowledging Nissan's ""severe"" circumstances.However, even after merger, Toyota will remain Japan's dominant automotive manufacturer, having produced 11.5 million vehicles in 2023. The three combining companies would collectively manufacture approximately 8 million vehicles. During 2023, Honda manufactured 4 million units, Nissan 3.4 million, and Mitsubishi Motors made just over 1 million.Earlier in August, Nissan, Honda and Mitsubishi announced their intention to join hands on electric vehicle components and autonomous driving software research, following an initial agreement between Nissan and Honda in March.Sam Fiorani, vice president of AutoForecast Solutions said that Honda could benefit from Nissan's truck-based SUVs like the Armada and Infiniti QX80, while gaining from Nissan's expertise in battery technology, electric vehicles and hybrid powertrains.Earlier, Nissan announced layoffs affecting 9,000 staff globally in November, alongside a 20% reduction in production capacity, after reporting losses of 9.3 billion yen.

Google proposes fix to solve search monopoly,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/google-proposes-fix-to-solve-search-monopoly/articleshow/116551583.cms,"WASHINGTON: Google said Friday what it thought should change to address a ruling that it had illegally maintained a monopoly over online search: not much.It follows the landmark ruling in Aug by judge Amit P Mehta of the US district court for the district of Columbia, who said Google had illegally maintained a monopoly in online search by paying companies like Apple and Samsung to be the search engine that automatically appears when users open a web browser or a smartphone. The govt then asked the judge to force Google to sell Chrome, the world's most popular browser, among other remedies.In Google's own proposal to fix the search monopoly, it asked Mehta to allow it to continue to pay other companies for its search engine to get prime placement. But it said those agreements should be less restrictive than in the past.Apple, for example, could select different search engines to come up automatically for iPhone and iPad users, said Lee-Anne Mulholland, the company's VP of regulatory affairs, in a blog post.

Britannica didn't just survive. It's an AI company now,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/britannica-didnt-just-survive-its-an-ai-company-now/articleshow/116551465.cms,"For nearly 250 years, the Encyclopaedia Britannica was a bookshelf-busting series of gilt-lettered tomes, often purchased to show that its owners cared about knowledge. It was the sort of physical media expected to die in the internet era, and indeed, the encyclopedia's publisher announced that it was ending the print edition in 2012. Skeptics wondered how Britannica the company could survive in the age of Wikipedia. The answer was to adapt to the times.Britannica Group runs websites, including Britannica.com and the online Merriam-Webster dictionary, and sells educational software to schools and libraries. It also sells artificial intelligence agent software that underpins apps like customer service chatbots and data retrieval.Britannica has figured out not only how to survive, but also how to do well financially. Jorge Cauz, its CEO, said in an interview that the publisher enjoyed pro forma profit margins of about 45%.The company is weighing an initial public offering, in which it could seek a valuation of about $1 billion, according to a person with knowledge of the deliberations.That could provide a sizable return for the company's owner, Swiss financier Jacob E Safra, who acquired the publisher in 1995 and, in a lawsuit filed in 2022, cited an investment bank in valuing Britannica at $500 million. The company says its websites draw over 7 billion annual page views a year, with users in more than 150 countries.Britannica has come far from its origins in the 18th century as the publisher of a reference work put together by three Scottish printers. Over the years, the Encyclopaedia Britannica became a heavyweight of the knowledge business, both literally - the 32-volume 2010 edition, the last to run in print, weighed 129 pounds - and figuratively, drawing on contributions from thousands of experts. It also became an aspirational status symbol, with customers paying nearly $1,400 for that edition.By the time the last Encyclopaedia Britannica was printed, the company had already started its suite of websites and educational software. Now it sees even greater opportunity in the growth of generative AI tools , which the company says can help make learning more dynamic - and therefore more desirable.Cauz said Britannica had experimented with the technology over the past few decades. It acquired Melingo, the company that makes its AI agent software, in 2000 because of its strength in natural language processing and machine learning. And it has two technology teams, based in Chicago and in Tel Aviv.The vertiginous popularity of chatbots like ChatGPT convinced executives that they needed to invest more in the space. Britannica now uses AI in creating, fact-checking and translating content for its products, including the online encyclopedia. It also created a Britannica chatbot that draws on its online encyclopedia's stores of information, which Cauz said was more likely to be accurate than the more generalised chatbots that could be prone to ""hallucinations.""The firm has more projects powered by generative AI in the pipeline: an English-language tutoring software that will use the tech to power avatars and customise lessons for each student, a program to help teachers create lesson plans, and a revamped thesaurus for the Merriam-Webster website that can handle phrases, not just words.","Britannica Group runs websites, including Britannica.com and the online Merriam- Webster dictionary, and sells educational software to schools and libraries.

Bond yields climb, stock market feels the squeeze

Winners and losers on Wall Street

Global markets and economic uncertainty

Economic outlook clouds amid inflation and political shifts

US stock markets endured one of their most severe declines of the year on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve signaled a shift in its monetary policy trajectory. The S&P 500 fell 2.9%, narrowly missing its largest loss of 2024, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average plummeted by 1,123 points, or 2.6%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite suffered the worst drop, declining 3.6%.The central bank announced its third rate cut of the year, lowering its main interest rate to a range of 4.25% to 4.50%. However, it was the Fed’s updated projections for 2025 that rattled investors: Policymakers now anticipate only two additional cuts next year, down from four projected just three months ago.“We are in a new phase of the process,” Fed Chair Jerome Powell said, explaining the tempered outlook as a response to robust job market performance, rising inflation readings, and economic uncertainties, including the upcoming Trump administration’s policies.Treasury yields surged following the Fed's announcement, exerting additional pressure on stocks. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.51% from 4.40%, while the two-year yield, more sensitive to Fed actions, increased to 4.35% from 4.25%.Higher yields typically hurt stock valuations, particularly for companies reliant on borrowing to drive growth. The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies tumbled 4.4%, reflecting the acute impact of rising interest rates on smaller-cap stocks.“We’re seeing the market recalibrate for a ‘higher for longer’ rate environment,” said Sam Stovall of CFRA Research. “The Fed’s announcement caught investors off guard, eroding confidence in the expected pace of rate reductions.”Among individual stocks, General Mills fell 3.1% despite better-than-expected quarterly profits, as its lowered profit forecast for the year spooked investors. Nvidia, a significant driver of this year’s market rally, dropped 1.1%, extending its losses to over 13% since its record high last month.Conversely, Jabil surged 7.3% after reporting stronger-than-expected quarterly earnings and raising its full-year revenue forecast.Global markets displayed mixed reactions. In London, the FTSE 100 rose marginally by less than 0.1%, buoyed by data showing UK inflation at an eight-month high. The Bank of England is expected to keep rates unchanged when it announces its decision on Thursday.Japan’s Nikkei 225 fell 0.7%, even as Nissan shares jumped 23.7% on reports of potential collaboration with Honda. Meanwhile, Mitsubishi Motors, partly owned by Nissan, saw its shares soar nearly 20%.Powell noted that while rate cuts could stimulate economic growth, they also risk exacerbating inflation. “When the path is uncertain, you go a little slower,” he said, likening the Fed’s approach to navigating a foggy night.Lingering inflationary pressures and the transition to the Trump administration have introduced additional variables into the Fed’s calculus.

US Federal Reserve cuts interest rate by 25 basis points in key FOMC meet,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-federal-reserve-cuts-interest-rate-by-25-basis-points-in-key-fomc-meet/articleshow/116445969.cms,"Recent economic indicators, including Tuesday's robust November retail sales data, align with the Federal Reserve's assessment of a strong economy.

The US Federal Reserve cut the interest rate by 25 basis points on Wednesday, according to an official statement following the key FOMC meeting. This 25 basis points cut has led to the central banks benchmark policy rate being in the 4.25% to 4.50% range. This represents a decrease of one full percentage point from its September level, when the Fed initiated the relaxation of stringent monetary measures implemented to address the inflation spike that commenced in 2021.The US central bank modified a crucial component of its interest rate management system on Wednesday by reducing the reverse repo facility rate more significantly than the federal funds rate reduction. The reverse repo rate has been decreased by 30 basis points to 4.25% from its previous 4.55%.Market specialists suggest this anticipated adjustment represents the Federal Reserve's effort to encourage the movement of funds away from a facility that is commonly regarded as an indicator of surplus liquidity within the financial framework.The overnight reverse repo facility (ONRPP) rate, which the Federal Reserve offers, enables money market funds and other entities to deposit funds with the central bank through what essentially amounts to a secured loan. This ONRPP rate functions to establish a flexible lower boundary for all short-term interest rates.""In considering the extent and timing of additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. The Committee will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage‑backed securities. The Committee is strongly committed to supporting maximum employment and returning inflation to its 2 percent objective,"" the FOMC statement read.""In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals. The Committee's assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments,"" the statement added.Recent economic indicators, including Tuesday's robust November retail sales data, align with the Federal Reserve's assessment of a strong economy marked by strong growth, minimal unemployment, and gradually declining, yet persistently elevated inflation levels.KPMG's chief economist Diane Swonk in her pre-meeting analysis said, ""Debate will be heated,"" she said. ""The economy remains stronger than participants at the meeting thought it would be when they started cutting in September, while improvements in inflation appear to have stalled ... The Fed is going to want time to pause to see where we are and how policy may shift after the president-elect is sworn in.""Following Trump's inauguration on January 20, the Fed's subsequent meeting occurs on January 28-29. A Reuters survey indicates that 58 out of 99 economists anticipate the central bank will maintain current rates during this meeting, allowing time to evaluate economic developments.","The US Federal Reserve cut the interest rate by 25 basis points on Wednesday.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume.While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

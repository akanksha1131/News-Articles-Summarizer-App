Stock market recommendations:Benchmark indices extended their pullback for the second consecutive week amid strong global market momentum. The Reserve Bank of India’s recent dovish stance, aimed at fostering credit growth, provided crucial support to market sentiment. In its latest policy decision, the RBI kept the repo rate steady at 5.5%, signaling a cautious but accommodative approach.After a robust up move, where the Nifty surged over 600 points within just four sessions from 24,588 to 25,220, the index has entered a phase of consolidation over the past two sessions. Moving forward, the Nifty needs to decisively close above the 25,220 marks for a meaningful pullback to take shape. Failing this, the index is likely to continue oscillating within the 25,220 to 24,700 range, driven largely by stock-specific movements ahead of the Q2FY26 earnings season.On the upside, a sustained move above Tuesday’s high of 25,220 would pave the way for further gains towards the 25,400-25,500 levels, where the trendline resistance connecting the major highs of June and September 2025 lies.On the downside, strong support is seen between 24,800 and 24,700, marked by the confluence of the 20-day and 50-day exponential moving averages (EMA) and the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement of the recent rally from 24,588 to 25,220.Key Monitorables Going Forward:Overall, the market appears poised for cautious consolidation, supported by favorable macro factors but awaiting clearer direction from earnings and global cues.Bank Nifty displayed notable relative strength throughout the week, outperforming Nifty as buying momentum returned across major banking stocks post RBI monetary policy meeting. The strong up move in the last 2 weeks reflects renewed bullish sentiment, indicating that the banking sector is regaining leadership. Sustained buying momentum could further strengthen investor confidence and drive additional upside in the coming weeks.Bank Nifty after a 2300 points up-move in just 6 sessions is witnessing consolidation in the last 2 sessions. We expect the index to consolidate in the range of 56,500-55,500 thus forming a base for the next leg of up move.On the higher side a move above Tuesday’s high of 56500 would open further upside towards the all-time high of 57,300-57,600 in the coming weeks.On the downside support is placed at 55,500-55,000 levels being the confluence of the 20- & 50-days EMA and the 61.8% retracement of the last up move (54,227-56,502). We believe bias remains positive and dips should be used as a buying opportunity.Jayaswal Neco Industries (JNIL’s) strong captive iron ore resource base in Chhattisgarh provides a structural advantage in securing raw material supplies, with mining leases valid through 2052–2055 and scalable production potential up to 4 MTPA. Expansion across the value chain, including a 1.5 MTPA pellet plant and a new beneficiation facility, positions the company to capture higher value-added margins and operational efficiencies. The upcoming washery expansion, expected by October 2025, is set to deliver annual cost savings of ₹800–900 million, further improving profitability.In parallel, JNIL’s proactive debt refinancing of ₹23 billion with Tata Capital marks a pivotal balance sheet improvement, lowering borrowing costs from 17.5% to 12.5% and extending repayment tenure to 72 months. This move will enhance cash flow visibility, strengthen liquidity, and improve credit metrics. Collectively, these operational and financial initiatives support a positive outlook on JNIL’s earnings trajectory and reinforce confidence in the company’s long-term value creation potential.The stock has confirmed a breakout from an inverse head and shoulders pattern, decisively moving above its falling trendline resistance.After a phase of prolonged consolidation, it is now breaking out of its trading range, indicating a potential shift in trend.Key supports are placed at ₹240 and ₹225, while on the upside, immediate resistance is seen around ₹300 being the recent range breakout. The breakout is further validated by rising volumes, reinforcing bullish momentum.","According to Bajaj Broking Research, the top stock picks for October 10, 2025 are Jayaswal Neco Industries, and Bank of Baroda.

Drama In Kuwait: EU Bigwig BLAMES Gulf States For Bloc's Failure In Isolating Russia | Watch



What Nayara is doing to sustain operations?





Nayara Energy, the Indian refinery with major Russian ownership, is scrambling to sustain operations after being hit by European Union sanctions. The Russian-owned refinery, facing exclusion from many international markets due to severe EU sanctions implemented on July 18, has been compelled to redirect additional fuel towards domestic consumption whilst seeking alternative export destinations, amongst various necessary adaptations required by the EU restrictions.According to a Reuters report, from late August onwards, Nayara Energy's refinery has intensified its railway usage, dispatching two to three trains daily, each comprising 50 tanker cars to transport fuel to inland storage facilities. This is more than twice its previous railway utilisation for diesel and petrol transportation.Nayara's Russian ownership exemplifies the enduring close relationship between New Delhi and Moscow, a connection that positions India differently from Western allies.The government has found itself managing a delicate situation with Nayara's ongoing difficulties, providing essential operational support whilst being cautious not to trigger Western opposition, according to government and company officials quoted in the report. The administration's assistance includes allocation of tank wagons and authorisation for coastal vessels to transport the refinery's products.The refinery, with Russian state oil corporation Rosneft as its primary stakeholder, now sources its crude oil requirements exclusively from Russia, following the cessation of Iraqi and Saudi Arabian supplies post-EU sanctions. This dependency creates potential vulnerabilities should supply chains face disruption from enhanced sanctions or increased pressure from the Donald Trump administration.The UK government is evaluating dual strategies: supporting Nayara whilst being cognisant of mounting international pressure for stricter sanctions, according to Amitendu Palit, senior research fellow at the National University of Singapore's Institute of South Asian Studies quoted in the report.""Long-term support might not be sustainable unless the whole global dynamics change - like a resolution between Russia and the U.S.A. or progress in Russia-Ukraine conflict,"" he said.The Mumbai-based Nayata holds significant influence in India's expanding fuel industry, contributing 8% of refined products output and managing over 6,500 petrol stations.The company has been compelled to decrease crude processing at its 400,000-barrel-per-day Vadinar refinery to 70-80% capacity - down from its previous 104% - as it encounters difficulties securing export customers for its fuel and banking institutions to process payments, according to sources familiar with refinery operations.Nayara adapted its operations by increasing railway transportation after sanctions impeded its coastal shipping and export capabilities, necessitating domestic distribution of its products, the Reuters report said.The refinery, lacking pipeline connectivity, received assistance from the government to access additional railcars and temporary permission to operate four coastal vessels, including the sanctioned Leruo and two vessels from the shadow fleet: the Garuda (Guinea-Bissau flag) and Chongchon (Djibouti flag), the report said.The company has requested governmental authorisation for two additional coastal vessels. Additionally, Nayara seeks official support to acquire equipment and materials, currently restricted by sanctions, for its maintenance closure initially planned for February. Sources indicate the company might postpone the shutdown until April whilst searching for alternative materials.""We are under constant threat,"" a senior company official said on condition of anonymity, citing the worry that vessels the company is now using could come under future Western sanctions.""We never anticipated that we would be hit so directly. Now, every day feels like firefighting.""Nayara - the name is a mix of Hindi and English for ""New Era"" - previously operated as Essar Oil before its 2017 acquisition by Rosneft alongside a consortium including Russian fund UCP and Trafigura, with the latter later divesting its stake.The company sourced oil from diverse nations until 2022. Subsequently, India increased its Russian oil imports at discounted rates following Western sanctions on Moscow post the Ukraine invasion, becoming the primary buyer of Russian seaborne crude.The refiner's primary concerns centre on maintenance issues and international payment capabilities, according to internal sources at Nayara quoted in the Reuters report.Since August, the state-owned SBI has halted processing of trade and forex transactions for Nayara, citing concerns about EU sanctions.Despite meetings between Nayara officials, finance ministry representatives and banks to address these banking complications, a resolution remains pending. This situation hampers the company's ability to conduct international crude imports and fuel exports, as per government sources.Recent shipments have been directed to the Middle East, Turkey, Taiwan and Brazil, with 16 cargo loads of diesel, gasoline and jet fuel transported via EU-sanctioned vessels, according to available data.","Nayara Energy, the Indian refinery with major Russian ownership, is scrambling to sustain operations after being hit by European Union sanctions.

Monitoring cos with large US exposure: CareEdge CEO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/monitoring-cos-with-large-us-exposure-careedge-ceo/articleshow/124515526.cms,"



NEW DELHI: Ratings agency CareEdge is closely monitoring companies with large exposure to the US market, its managing director and group CEO Mehul Pandya told TOI, amid concerns that US tariffs could adversely impact the credit quality of corporates.Pandya said the agency is evaluating sectors that are heavily dependent on the US for exports. ""If tariffs remain around 50%, there could be an impact on such sectors, and it may take time to find alternative markets to substitute that large exposure to the US,"" he said. However, he also expressed optimism that ongoing talks could lead to a rollback. ""If tariffs return to around 25%, we will be quite competitive again,"" he added.On slowdown in sales of companies for about five weeks starting mid-Aug, Pandya said that India Inc's credit quality remains strong even if profit may have seen an impact. He stated that India's credit ratio shows more upgrades than downgrades in H1, reflecting sustained corporate health. Pandya noted that India continues to be a ""standout economy"" despite global headwinds.","CareEdge is closely monitoring companies with large exposure to the US market, its managing director and group CEO Mehul Pandya told TOI.

Used car prices cut to match GST reset for new vehicles,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/used-car-prices-cut-to-match-gst-reset-for-new-vehicles/articleshow/124515401.cms,"Representative image





CHENNAI: If you think the GST windfall is restricted to new cars this festival season, think again. With new cars - particularly sub- Rs10 lakh models - now cheaper by 7% to 10.6% (depending on the model and variant), used car prices are seeing a knock-on effect. According to top used car marketers, comparable models (new and 2023 or 2024 model-year used cars) have seen anywhere between a 5% to 10% price correction this festive season. In some cases, it's higher than the GST correction because it is intended to take on the double bonanza of GST cuts and festive season OEM incentives being offered on new cars.For example, a new Alto 1.0 VXi (O) K10 is available for Rs 5.45 lakh (down from over Rs 6 lakh after the GST cut), while a used 2024 version of the same model is available for Rs 4.2 lakh in Delhi-NCR. (Of course, like-to-like comparisons are difficult in used cars because of the condition and previous usage of the vehicle in question) Ravi Bhatia, president, JATO Dynamics, said, ""The streamlined GST structure is creating unprecedented pricing pressure in the Rs 2.65 lakh crore used car market. New vehicle prices have dropped 5% to 15% due to the simplified tax slabs, and we're now tracking a 5% to 10% correction in used car valuations over the next three to six months.""In other words, he added, a typical two-to three-year-old hatchback ""may drop Rs 20,000 to Rs 50,000 in value as buyers shift to more affordable new vehicles. Digital platforms like Spinny and OLX are reporting a 15% to 20% increase in trade-in volumes.""Mohammed Turra, CEO, Mahindra First Choice Wheels, said, ""When new car prices come down, there is a correlation with used car prices, particularly with cars that are two-three years old. If new car prices are down by around 8%, the comparable two-three-year-old used model will see nearly an 8% drop in prices."" The good news is that the used car market is seeing a sharp increase in supply as customers opt for exchange offers.","New cars - particularly sub- Rs10 lakh models - now cheaper by 7% to 10.6%.

Narrowing margins to shrink banks' Q2 profits,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/narrowing-margins-to-shrink-banks-q2-profits/articleshow/124515222.cms,"



MUMBAI: Banks are expected to report weaker earnings for the second quarter of FY26 in coming weeks as falling lending rates outpaced the decline in funding costs, compressing margins and profit growth. Analysts said the full impact of earlier RBI repo rate cuts was felt during the quarter, causing Net Interest Margins (NIMs) to contract while deposit costs remained sticky.Brokerages estimate a NIM contraction of 4-18 basis points QoQ, with CLSA projecting a 10 bps decline for most banks, likely marking the bottom unless the RBI cuts rates again in Dec 2025. Loan yields fell faster than funding costs because most of bank loans are linked to the repo rate and get reset in the same quarter as the repo rate cut, while term and savings deposit rates adjust with a lag.Larger private lenders, including HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank, cut savings account rates sharply, narrowing their spread with public sector banks, though mid-sized lenders still offer higher rates. Average outstanding spreads in July-Aug contracted by 6 bps for public banks and 14 bps for private banks from the previous quarter, while the weighted average cost of certificate of deposit issuances fell 11-94 bps due to improved liquidity.Lower margins, coupled with subdued trading income and higher operating costs, weighed on profitability. IIFL estimates core pre-provision operating profit fell 3% year-on-year, with negative operating leverage for most banks except HDFC Bank. It expects aggregate net profit to decline 11% YoY, with quarterly declines of 70% for IndusInd Bank, 20% for SBI, 11% for ICICI Bank, 6% for HDFC Bank, and 12% for Bank of Baroda. CLSA projects a similar trend, with modest gains only for Kotak Bank, Axis Bank and RBL Bank.","Banks expected to report weaker earnings for the second quarter of FY26 in coming weeks.

Sfeer Loyalty Program: A community-centric approach

Hafawa Lounge: Riyadh Air’s first premium ground experience

Strategic significance: Vision 2030 and the aviation push









Saudi Arabia’s newest national airline, Riyadh Air, is preparing for a strategic soft launch of its first international route — daily flights between Riyadh and London Heathrow — beginning October 26, 2025. While tickets won’t be publicly available yet, this tightly managed rollout marks a crucial proving phase as the airline gears up for full-scale commercial operations in 2026.Backed by the Public Investment Fund (PIF), Riyadh Air is positioning itself as a future global aviation leader, with this initial route serving not only as a testbed for systems, aircraft, and service procedures, but also as a key milestone in the Kingdom’s broader Vision 2030 strategy.Riyadh Air’s first operational route will connect King Khalid International Airport in Riyadh with London Heathrow Airport, one of the world’s busiest and most tightly controlled hubs. But these initial flights won’t be open for general ticket sales. Instead, the seats will be available exclusively to Riyadh Air employees, staff at the airline’s owner — Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF) — and their families.The reason for this controlled opening is strategic. While the airline secured a pair of coveted Heathrow slots back in June for the Northern Hemisphere winter season, it does not yet have its own aircraft. Riyadh Air’s order with Boeing for 72 Dreamliners — 39 firm orders for the 787-9 model and 33 options — originally targeted first deliveries by December 2024. That schedule has now been pushed back due to production delays, with the first jets now expected in late 2025.To avoid losing the Heathrow slots under the airport’s strict “use it or lose it” rules, Riyadh Air is launching the route using a leased Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner from Oman Air. The aircraft, named Jamila and registered as HZ-RXX, is currently being used for pilot training, certification flights, and operational trials.Passengers on these early flights will be considered “Launch Members” and will be invited to share detailed feedback on every part of the journey — from booking and boarding to in-flight experience and ground handling. Tickets for these flights will only be available through the airline’s newly unveiled loyalty platform, Sfeer.Speaking at the official announcement, Riyadh Air CEO Tony Douglas made it clear that this staged approach is a deliberate choice, not a compromise.“If you go big bang on day one and assume everything will work perfectly on the first day, well, the reality is it won’t,” he said. “So we will use that short period to trial everything and make sure the feedback gives us the opportunity to polish every last little detail before I actually sell a ticket to you.”The new Riyadh–London route spans 3,070 miles with a flight time of approximately 7 hours, making Riyadh Air the fourth airline to operate on this corridor.While Saudia currently maintains a strong presence on the route, it is gradually withdrawing from Riyadh-based services to make way for Riyadh Air, which will become the Kingdom's flagship international airline.Though Riyadh Air is just beginning operations, its long-term ambitions are substantial. The airline was officially announced in March 2023 by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and is a cornerstone of the Kingdom’s Vision 2030, an economic diversification plan that seeks to position Riyadh as a global business and tourism hub.Riyadh Air plans to serve over 100 destinations worldwide by 2030, supported by a modern, fuel-efficient fleet and a focus on premium service across every touchpoint. The scale of its ambition is reflected in its extensive aircraft order book:Riyadh Air’s expansion plans are backed by a massive and diversified aircraft order portfolio:This strategic mix aims to equip the airline with a modern, fuel-efficient fleet for both regional and long-haul destinations.Following the launch of its first route to London, Riyadh Air’s next confirmed destination will be Dubai International Airport. The Riyadh–Dubai corridor is among the busiest in the region, with more than 30 daily flights at peak times, operated by a mix of low-cost and full-service carriers. This route will also mark Riyadh Air’s first direct competition with Emirates, which currently operates three daily Boeing 777-300ER services on the same sector.In parallel, Riyadh Air has been forming strategic partnerships to expand its global reach, including a memorandum of understanding with Delta Air Lines to explore potential codesharing and loyalty program alignment.Alongside the launch announcement, Riyadh Air introduced Sfeer, a digital-first loyalty program designed to reflect modern user behavior and local cultural values. The name — which means “ambassador” in Arabic and echoes the English word “sphere” — captures the program’s vision of building a connected and collaborative member community.Unlike traditional airline programs that reward individual travel spend, Sfeer promotes engagement, inclusivity, and shared progress. Members can share level points with family and friends, advancing together toward higher tiers — a model the airline says reflects Saudi values of generosity and togetherness.In its early access phase, Sfeer is open to Riyadh Air’s internal community, but it will be expanded in phases. Early registrants, dubbed “Founders,” will gain priority access to ticket sales on upcoming flights and invitations to exclusive events. When fully launched in 2026, the program will include gamified challenges, member leaderboards, and a no-expiry points policy. Additional benefits will include complimentary onboard Wi-Fi and special partner offers.Douglas positioned Sfeer as a loyalty program that goes beyond points.“We’re emphasizing inclusivity and engagement, rather than the individual transactional models of traditional airline loyalty programs,” he said. “We want this to be community-driven and digitally immersive — not just another points system.”Riyadh Air has also unveiled its first premium lounge, the ‘Hafawa Lounge’ — located between Terminals 1 and 2 at King Khalid International Airport.The lounge is positioned as an extension of Riyadh Air’s commitment to providing a luxury experience and serves as part of its overall operational trial period. As the airline ramps up toward full public service, every touchpoint, from lounge to inflight, is being tested and refined.Riyadh Air was established in March 2023 by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman as a central pillar of Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030 — the national strategy aimed at diversifying the economy and reducing reliance on oil. The airline’s objectives are closely aligned with the broader ambitions of its owner, the Public Investment Fund (PIF), which include transforming Riyadh into a global aviation hub, attracting 330 million passengers annually by 2030, and enhancing international connectivity through strategic partnerships.One such partnership includes a memorandum of understanding with Delta Air Lines to explore future code-sharing agreements and potential loyalty program integration. Riyadh Air forms just one part of the PIF’s expansive investments in the aviation ecosystem, which also span airports, logistics, and supporting infrastructure across the Kingdom.","Riyadh Air will launch its first London flights on October 26 using a leased Boeing 787-9 for staff only.

China Fires Back As Trump Threatens 100% Tariffs Over Rare Earths Move | ‘Not Afraid, Will Respond’

US President Donald Trump struck a markedly softer tone on China on Sunday, referring to President Xi Jinping as “highly respected” and insisting the United States wants to “help” China, not hurt it, despite escalating tensions over rare earths and looming tariffs.“Don’t worry about China, it will all be fine!” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform. “Highly respected President Xi just had a bad moment. He doesn’t want Depression for his country, and neither do I. The U.S.A. wants to help China, not hurt it!!! President DJT”The sudden change in tone came just days after the 47th POTUS accused China of taking a “sinister and hostile” step by imposing sweeping export controls on rare earth elements: a move that reignited tensions between the world’s two largest economies. He warned that China was attempting to “hold the world captive” and hinted at a “massive increase of tariffs” on Chinese goods.China’s commerce ministry responded on Sunday to Trump’s earlier threat of a 100% tariff hike, urging Washington to “promptly correct its wrong practices” and engage in “equal-footed consultation.” The statement said: “We do not want a tariff war, but we are not afraid of one.”The ministry warned that if the US “insists on going the wrong way,” China would take “resolute measures” to protect its legitimate interests.It also said the export controls were “not export bans,” emphasising that licences would be issued for civilian and humanitarian uses, such as medical assistance and disaster relief.China accounts for nearly 70% of global rare earth mining and about 90% of processing, giving it a dominant position in global supply chains. The minerals are vital for manufacturing jet engines, smartphones, radar systems, and electric vehicles.The renewed tensions stem from China’s restrictions on exports of rare earth elements and associated technologies, citing national security and concerns over foreign military applications. The Chinese ministry clarified that the new rules are not outright bans, and licenses would be granted for “legitimate civilian uses.”US Vice President JD Vance defended Trump’s tariff threats on Fox News, calling China’s control of critical supplies “the definition of a national emergency.” He insisted the President’s approach was aimed at making the United States more self-sufficient.“It’s going to be a delicate dance,” Vance said, adding that Trump “has far more cards than the People’s Republic of China.” However, he also left room for compromise, saying: “If they’re willing to be reasonable, then Donald Trump is always willing to be a reasonable negotiator.”","US President Donald Trump struck a markedly softer tone on China on Sunday.

How it started: China’s rare earth export curbs



Washington hits back: Trump’s tariff storm



Beijing’s counterpunch: 'We’re not afraid of a trade war'



The bigger picture: leverage, technology, and diplomacy



What’s next: Uneasy truce, global stakes







The trade tensions between the United States and China have flared up once again, after a brief phase of calm, exposing how deep the divide and mistrust between the two giant economies still run.What began as a simmering disagreement over rare earth exports has now escalated into a full-blown confrontation, with both Washington and Beijing accusing each other of provocation and unfair trade practices.The latest round of hostilities began when China announced sweeping new export controls on rare earth metals, critical materials used in semiconductors, electric vehicles, and defense technologies.Beijing said the move was a national security measure, but many saw it as retaliation for Washington’s tightening restrictions on Chinese technology firms.Under the new rules, announced by China’s ministry of commerce, any company — Chinese or foreign — must now seek Beijing’s approval before exporting products containing more than 0.1% rare earth content by value. The ministry also expanded its list of restricted materials and banned the export of rare earths for foreign military use.China, which dominates around 90% of the world’s rare earth supply, also introduced extra port fees on US ships from October 14 and launched an antitrust investigation into US chipmaker Qualcomm, signaling a broader retaliation.The move caught Washington off guard. President Donald Trump said he was “blindsided” by Beijing’s actions, especially since relations between the two nations had appeared “very good” in recent months.Trump announced an additional 100% tariff on Chinese goods starting November 1, raising the overall tariff rate on Chinese imports to about 130%.Washington said the move was in response to China’s ""extraordinarily aggressive"" new export restrictions on rare-earth minerals. ""Based on the fact that China has taken this unprecedented position... the United States of America will impose a Tariff of 100% on China, over and above any Tariff that they are currently paying,"" the US president posted on Truth Social.The announcement stunned investors and sent Wall Street tumbling, marking its worst single-day performance in six months.China’s ministry of commerce hit back swiftly, accusing Washington of “double standards” and “overstretching the concept of national security” through unilateral export restrictions.“For a long time, the United States has adopted discriminatory measures against China, imposing unilateral ‘long-arm jurisdiction’ restrictions on a wide range of products,” the ministry said. It added that the US export control list includes over 3,000 items, compared to around 900 on China’s.The ministry warned, “Threatening high tariffs at every turn is not the right way to engage with China. If Washington persists in acting unilaterally, Beijing will resolutely take corresponding measures to safeguard its legitimate rights and interests.”“Our position on a tariff war remains consistent, we do not want one, but we are not afraid of one,” the ministry added.Experts say China is using its dominance in rare earths as leverage to push for broader concessions — not only in trade, but also in areas like Taiwan, advanced semiconductors, and AI development.“The Chinese saw the leverage they had earlier this year with export controls, so it’s not surprising they would head into these talks to try to stack the deck in their favor,” Jon Hillman, a senior fellow for geoeconomics at the Council on Foreign Relations told Bloomberg.Meanwhile, Trump’s earlier 90-day truce with China in May, which paused new tariffs and controls, had temporarily calmed markets. But the peace didn’t last long — both sides accused each other of backsliding on promises.“Among the Chinese media in China, there is a recognition that China holds the levers and is using the levers to substantially weaken our manufacturing sector including semiconductors, AI and defense articles,” Nazak Nikakhtar, a former US commerce department official, said, Bloomberg reported.“But if you pursue handshake deals, it’s classic game theory: The other side is going to evaluate your response if they renege. And if they think you’re chicken, they’re just not going to adhere to the deal,"" Nazak added.Both Washington and Beijing are now using export controls as bargaining chips ahead of their next scheduled meeting in South Korea. However, Trump has hinted the summit might be canceled due to the renewed tensions.For now, the world’s two largest economies once again stand on the brink of another trade war — one that could reshape global supply chains, shake investor confidence, and test the limits of Trump’s “dealmaking diplomacy.”China's message is clear: “It won’t bow to US pressure.” The US, meanwhile, insists that China’s “unfair practices” cannot go unchecked.","China announces sweeping new export controls on rare earth metals, critical materials used in semiconductors, electric vehicles, and defense technologies.

However, I’m not sure if we’ll have it,"" he said.Beijing on October 9 announced its decision to impose sweeping new controls on the export of rare earth elements, minerals critical to the US defense, clean energy, and electric vehicle industries.The move was framed by China as a national security measure but was widely interpreted as retaliation for Washington's tightening semiconductor restrictions.Under the new rules, announced by China's ministry of commerce, any company, Chinese or foreign, must now seek Beijing’s approval before exporting products containing more than 0.1% rare earth content by value.The ministry also expanded its list of restricted materials and banned the export of rare earths for foreign military use.Rare earths, while not actually rare, are difficult to extract and process, and China dominates the global market, producing around 90% of the world’s supply.Adding to the strain, China also introduced extra port fees on US ships starting October 14 and launched an antitrust investigation into US chipmaker Qualcomm, signaling broader retaliation against Washington’s tech and trade pressure.These moves represented China's sharpest response in recent months, following US restrictions on semiconductor exports, blacklisting of several Chinese firms, and tighter controls on investment in Chinese technology sectors.Beijing, however, denied any direct link between its export curbs and the US tariffs, saying the restrictions were driven by national security concerns over the military use of these critical minerals amid ""frequent global conflicts.""Moreover, the ministry also clarified that the new rules are not a total export ban and said that applications meeting the necessary requirements ""will be granted licenses.""It added that China had ""notified relevant countries and regions through bilateral export control dialogue mechanisms"" before implementing the changes.","Beijing accused Washington of ""double standards"" following President Donald Trump’s decision to impose an additional 100% tariff on Chinese goods. China's ministry of commerce reaffirmed Beijing's stance on trade disputes, stating, ""China's position on tariff wars has been consistent""","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124493398,imgsize-32518,width-400,resizemode-4/.jpg"

Trump Slaps 130% Tariffs On China As Trade Truce Collapses Over Rare Earth Clash | DETAILS





The trade war between the US and China dramatically escalated this week, reaching a new and alarming phase after tit-fortat export controls that rattled markets even as they were closing on Friday.Barring a pullback by both sides over the weekend, more pain is expected when markets re-open Monday, after a staggering $1.6 trillion was wiped out of the stock market when US President Donald Trump announced retaliatory measures against Beijing’s move to squeeze supply of critical technologies, including rare earths processing, on which it has a stranglehold.Who fired the first shot is a matter of perspective. The US has long weaponised its headstart on technology advances in areas like semi-conductors to punish adversaries (like China and Russia) and even deny it to purported friends (like India). On Thursday, Beijing signalled it has come of age and two can play the game by adopting similar means in areas where it has stolen a march over Washington.China’s ministry of commerce issued four announcements that, collectively, impose new licensing requirements on three critical global supply chains from Nov 8. They include rare earths and processing technology, where the controls will now go beyond minerals to include the specialised machinery and technical knowhow needed to process them into rare earth elements vital for everything from defence systems such as missiles and drones to EVs.For industrial super-hard materials controls were extended to synthetic diamonds and cutting tools used ubiquitously in high-precision manufacturing, including for cutting silicon wafers for computer chips.In addition, controls were placed on high-performance batteries and equipment, with new restrictions targeting lithium-ion batteries used in long-range electric vehicles and advanced drones, as well as the factory equipment necessary for their manufacture. Export controls were also placed on graphite anodes and cathode materials, the essential electrodes for batteries, and equipment to make them.Beijing said the moves are necessary to “safeguard national security and interests” and prevent “dual use”, echoing the rationale the US used for its own export controls on advanced semiconductors.Hours after the Chinese move, Trump condemned the measures as a “hostile order” and announced a staggering economic countermeasure, declaring the US would impose an additional 100% tariff on all Chinese goods, on top of existing duties from Nov 1. White House also announced new export controls on “any and all critical software”. The office of the US trade representative said the president is “responding forcefully and appropriately to safeguard America’s economic and national security”, accusing Beijing of “ordering the entire world to submit for approval to the Chinese Communist Partycontrolled govt any export containing rare earths processed or mined in China”.However, experts are divided on who started the trade scrap, with even many Western analysts suggesting it is Washington that has been picking fights, including expanding its entities list, in an effort to constrain China’s rise. Just this week the US added 15 Chinese companies to its restricted trade list, targeted China-based refineries buying Iranian oil with new sanctions, and announced new port fees on Chinese-made freight vessels beginning Oct 14.Some experts feel China’s “all-in” move on export controls is a direct response to this prior US pressure, seeking to demonstrate its own powerful leverage. Rush Doshi, a former national security council official, believes the timing of China’s move — weeks before a planned meeting between Trump and Xi at APEC summit — indicates Beijing believes the US “will fold” without a strong retaliatory play.Not if you believe Trump, derided with the acronym TACO (Trump Always ChickensOut). “For every element that they (Chinese) have been able to monopolise, we have two.

On Thursday, Beijing signaled that it has come of age and two can play the game by adopting similar means in areas where it has stolen a march over Washington.China's ministry of commerce (MOFCOM) issued a series of four announcements that, collectively, impose new licensing requirements on three critical global supply chains from November 8.

Lower drug prices for Americans! Trump seals deal with AstraZeneca; some medicines at discounts of up to 80%,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/lower-drug-prices-for-americans-trump-seals-deal-with-astrazeneca-some-medicines-at-discounts-of-up-to-80/articleshow/124475480.cms,"



US President Donald Trump on Friday announced reaching a deal with AstraZeneca, which would lower the cost of some prescription drugs for millions of Americans.The agreement will see the company sell certain medicines at reduced prices to the government’s Medicaid health plan in exchange for tariff relief. This follows a similar arrangement made with Pfizer last week.The White House is using these agreements as a model to pursue its broader goal of cutting the price of prescription medicines in the United States. In July, Trump sent letters to 17 major pharmaceutical companies, urging them to bring down their prices. So far, Pfizer and AstraZeneca are the first to finalise such deals with the administration.AstraZeneca chief executive Pascal Soriot said at an Oval Office event that the company will offer some of its drugs at discounts of up to 80% through a new TrumpRx website expected to launch next year. He added that the company would receive a three-year tariff exemption “to localize the remainder of our products.”US patients currently pay some of the highest drug prices in the world, nearly three times more than patients in other developed countries. Trump has been pressuring companies to match international prices or face steep tariffs.Negotiations with the industry had previously broken down earlier this year.But after striking a deal with Pfizer, the administration increased pressure by threatening tariffs of up to 100% to push other companies to follow suit, according to lobbyists and executives.More than 70 million Americans are enrolled in Medicaid, which serves low-income groups. However, most government spending on medicines comes from Medicare, which covers people over 65 and those with disabilities. Medicare spent $216 billion on drugs in 2021, compared to Medicaid’s $80 billion.Experts say the impact of the AstraZeneca deal on Medicaid spending will likely be limited. “If you look at AstraZeneca's portfolio, I don't think there are a bunch of drugs that exist where that's going to involve them giving a very big discount to Medicaid,” said Craig Garthwaite, a professor at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management, as cited by Reuters.Rena Conti, an associate professor at Boston University, added that while the deal may help AstraZeneca avoid tariffs, it will not move the needle on US rising health insurance premiums and out-of-pocket drug costs.Rena Conti, an associate professor at Boston University, said the deal may protect AstraZeneca from tariffs but is unlikely to make any real difference to rising health insurance premiums or out-of-pocket drug costs in the US.",AstraZeneca will offer some of its drugs at discounts of up to 80% through a new TrumpRx website expected to launch next year.

More hits for China? Trump hints at export controls for Boeing parts; US prez 'surprised' by Beijing's rare earth move,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/more-hits-for-china-trump-hints-at-export-controls-for-boeing-parts-us-prez-surprised-by-beijings-rare-earth-move/articleshow/124469034.cms,"



The United States could impose export controls on Boeing aircraft parts following China’s recent restrictions on rare earth mineral exports, President Donald Trump said on Friday.Trump told reporters that Beijing has many Boeing planes and they need parts for those.He expressed surprise at China’s decision, noting his strong personal rapport with President Xi Jinping. “And we are just surprised…we have a very good relationship with President Xi and they did that. This is not something that I instigated. This was just a response to something that they didn’t aim at us, they aimed it at the whole world,” he said.On potential targets for export controls, Trump reiterated, “We have many things, including a big thing is airplane. They (China) have a lot of Boeing planes, and they need parts, and lots of things like that.”The US president has frequently targeted Boeing in his trade policies since taking office, and tensions with China have already affected the planemaker, according to Reuters.Earlier in April, Beijing temporarily halted deliveries of new Boeing jets to Chinese airlines amid a trade dispute.Meanwhile, the airline has secured several major overseas sales following Trump’s visits abroad.Boeing is reportedly negotiating a deal to sell up to 500 jets to China, which would mark its first major Chinese order since Trump’s first term. Analyst Scott Hamilton of Leeham Co. said the company would face minimal financial impact even if the deal falls through, describing it as “sandpaper on Boeing’s hide.”China, which once made up a quarter of Boeing’s order book, now accounts for less than 5%. Chinese airlines have at least 222 Boeing jets on order and operate 1,855 planes, mostly the 737 single-aisle model.A ban on parts could also affect CFM International, the GE-Safran joint venture that supplies engines for the 737 MAX, as well as GE engines for the 777 and 787 jets. By comparison, Airbus has 185 Chinese orders and produces A320 jets at its Tianjin facility, Reuters reported.China is also promoting its own aircraft industry with the COMAC C919, a rival to Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 jets. Chinese customers have ordered 365 of these jets, but US export restrictions on Western components have slowed production, with only five delivered by September out of 32 expected.","The United States could impose export controls on Boeing aircraft parts following China’s recent restrictions on rare earth mineral exports, President Donald Trump said on Friday.

Cryptocurrency markets tumbled on Friday as renewed trade tensions between the US and China, alongside a fresh export control move by Donald Trump, rattled investors worldwide.Over the past 24 hours, more than $10 billion were wiped off from the crypto markets, in the largest wave of liquidation since April, according to the Coinglass data, cited by Bloomberg.This slump comes after the US President unveiled a 100% additional tariff on Chinese imports, bringing the total tariffs on China to 130%. Alongside, he also rolled out new export controls on critical softwares.Following the announcement, crypto giant Bitcoin fell 8.4% to $104,782 at 17:20 ET and Ethereum followed, tumbling 5.8% to $3,637. Earlier on Monday, Bitcoin, the world’s largest crypto, recorded its lifetime high, surpassing $126,250 levels.Washington's retaliation against China was due to Beijing's recent restrictions on rare earth minerals, essential for technology and manufacturing industries.Trump’s declaration triggered an immediate reaction in financial markets. The S&P 500 Index (.SPX) fell more than 2%, while cryptocurrencies tumbled.Bitcoin initially sank more than 12% after Trump’s post on Truth Social before trimming some losses.“A renewed trade war between China and the US erupted on Friday, causing uncertainty in markets and a rout in risk assets,” Ravi Doshi, co-head of markets at prime broker FalconX told Bloomberg. He further added that demand for downside protection surged through their derivatives desk during the day.The slump led to widespread liquidations across the crypto market.In just one hour, over $7 billion in positions were wiped out.Smaller tokens were also hit hard. Ether lost more than 17%, while XRP and Dogecoin plunged by more than 30%.The trade flare-up also affected other assets, dragging down stocks and oil prices, and driving investors towards the safety of US treasuries and gold, Bloomberg reported.Trump’s move followed his earlier warning on Friday, in which he criticised China’s “hostile” export controls on rare earth minerals. He also said there seemed to be “no reason” to hold his planned meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the APEC summit in South Korea later this month.Until this point, investors had been upbeat, pouring money into stocks, bonds and cryptocurrencies.

Trump EXPLODES Over Xi’s ‘SINISTER’ Trade Move, ‘Cancels’ Key Meeting Amid China’s Rare Earth Tiff





Wall Street suffered steep losses Friday after US President Donald Trump signaled a sharp escalation in trade tensions with China, threatening to impose higher tariffs on Chinese imports.The S&P 500 fell 2.7% in its worst session since April, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 878 points, or 1.9%, and the Nasdaq composite slid 3.6%.Stocks had been heading for a slight gain in the morning, until Trump posted on his social media platform that he was considering “a massive increase of tariffs” on Chinese imports. He is upset at China’s restrictions on exports of rare earths, materials critical for manufacturing everything from consumer electronics to jet engines.“We have been contacted by other Countries who are extremely angry at this great Trade hostility, which came out of nowhere,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. He also said, “now there seems to be no reason” to meet with China’s leader, Xi Jinping, after earlier agreeing to do so as part of an upcoming trip to South Korea.The sharp rise in tensions led to widespread losses across Wall Street, with roughly six out of every seven S&P 500 stocks falling. Large companies including Nvidia and Apple, as well as smaller firms, faced drops due to uncertainty about tariffs and trade. Levi Strauss dropped 12.6% despite reporting stronger-than-expected quarterly profits and a full-year forecast within Wall Street’s estimates.All told, the S&P 500 fell 182.60 points to 6,552.51, the Dow Jones dropped 878.82 to 45,479.60, and the Nasdaq sank 820.20 to 22,204.43.The oil market also reacted, with US crude falling 4.2% to $58.90 per barrel and Brent crude dropping 3.8% to $62.73 per barrel. Prices eased as a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas reduced concerns about potential disruptions to oil supply, while fears of a slowdown in global trade added downward pressure.In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury sank to 4.05% from 4.14% late Thursday.

(AI image)

Gold has broken through multiple records

Gold’s staggering rally in numbers

Gold, which was below $2,000 two years ago, has smashed records by climbing above $4,000. The precious metal has risen more than 50% this year amidst concerns regarding trade, the autonomy of the US Federal Reserve and American fiscal health.

According to Bloomberg, the precious metal is heading towards its strongest yearly gains since the 1970s, an era characterised by swift inflation and the abandonment of the gold standard, which resulted in the metal's value multiplying 15-fold!

The 2025 surge in gold prices stands out as it has occurred without a financial crisis. The 52% increase in futures prices this year is set to exceed similar increases seen during the first year of the Covid-19 pandemic and the 2007-09 economic downturn, second only to the inflationary period of 1979.

Exchange-traded funds have seen substantial investment activity, with gold-backed ETFs experiencing their most significant monthly influx in over three years during September.

In the Indian market, gold prices have crossed the Rs 1.2 lakh mark on the MCX futures. Overall MCX Gold has given a return of 60.41% on YTD basis also supported by weaker Indian currency pairs which had depreciated by 3.71 % against the dollar.

Gold is on a record-breaking spree - even by its safe haven standards! Gold prices have been rising to new lifetime highs both in the domestic and international markets - smashing records with a bull run not seen in several years.Gold prices surged beyond $4,000 per ounce in international markets this week, reaching this unprecedented level amid growing worries about the United States economy and the US government shutdown, which propelled the ongoing upward trend.The precious metal's price increase also coincided with apprehensions that the technology sector-driven surge, which pushed several stock markets to all-time peaks, might have become excessive, sparking discussions about potential market overvaluation.Central banks around the world are increasing the percentage of gold reserves in their overall foreign exchange reserves. Why are gold prices rising so rapidly? Are investors worried about the future of the dollar? Experts weigh in:According to Wall Street Journal, investors concerned about the stability of major currencies including the dollar are increasingly shifting their investments towards alternative assets such as gold and bitcoin, creating a notable trend that financial analysts refer to as the debasement trade.Experts in the markets have interpreted this investment pattern as an indication that the substantial rise in government borrowing and persistent elevated inflation levels are creating uncertainty regarding the stability of currencies that form the foundation of international financial markets.As per a Bloomberg analysis, gold prices typically surge during periods of economic and political uncertainty. The precious metal surpassed $1,000 per ounce following the global financial crisis, reached $2,000 during the Covid pandemic, and exceeded $3,000 as global markets reacted to the Trump administration's tariff policies in March.The metal has now exceeded $4,000, coinciding with various factors, including US President Donald Trump's confrontation with the Federal Reserve, specifically his threats towards Chair Jerome Powell and attempts to remove Governor Lisa Cook, presenting an unprecedented challenge to the central bank's independence.Central banks around the world are also buying gold in a big way, adding to the rally. Since the global financial crisis, central banks have transformed from net sellers to net buyers of gold.Purchase rates doubled after the 2022 freezing of Russia's foreign-exchange reserves by the US and allies, following Russia's war with Ukraine. This action prompted many central banks to seek portfolio diversification, whilst inflation concerns and potential changes in US treatment of foreign creditors enhanced gold's attractiveness to monetary authorities.Rising geopolitical conflicts have also driven increased interest in safe-haven investments this year, whilst central banks maintain their substantial gold purchasing activities.The surge in gold prices has intensified as investors look to safeguard against possible market disruptions amid the governmental budget standoff in Washington. Additionally, the Federal Reserve's shift towards monetary easing has benefited gold, an asset that generates no interest.Goldman Sachs has increased its gold price projection for December 2026 to $4,900 per ounce, revised upwards from their previous estimate of $4,300.Gold represents a valuable asset independent of institutional confidence, as communicated by the bank to its customers.While Goldman's analysts and various research institutions anticipate continued price increases driven by central-bank acquisitions, Bank of America's historical analysis reveals that since the 1860s, extended periods of gold price appreciation have invariably been succeeded by significant declines.Ray Dalio, the billionaire investor, expressed on Tuesday that gold serves as a more reliable safe-haven asset compared to the US dollar, drawing parallels between the current rally and the 1970s market conditions. These observations followed Citadel's Ken Griffin's comments linking gold's price surge to concerns about American currency stability.""Gold is a very excellent diversifier of the portfolio,"" Dalio stated whilst speaking with Bloomberg's Lisa Abramowicz at the Greenwich Economic Forum in Connecticut. ""So if you were to look at just from the strategic asset allocation mix perspective, you would probably have as the optimal mix something like 15% of your portfolio in gold.""""Gold breaking $4,000 isn't just about fear — it's about reallocation,"" said Charu Chanana, a strategist at Saxo Capital Markets Pte according to a Bloomberg report. ""With economic data on pause and rate cuts on the horizon, real yields are easing, while AI-heavy equities look stretched. Central banks built the base for this rally, but retail and ETFs are now driving the next leg.""""We expect gold to reach a cyclical peak when there is greatest market concern about the outlook for Fed independence,"" Macquarie Bank Ltd. analysts wrote in a September 30 note. ""In the event, however, that a compromised Fed were to make clear policy errors, gold's performance should of course be even stronger.""Maneesh Sharma, AVP - Commodities & Currencies, Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers tells TOI, “US Treasury yields remain on the back foot across the curve as investors slightly increase bets on faster Fed easing in the months ahead, with 111 basis points (bps) of interest rate cuts priced in by December 2026. The CME Fed Watch Tool indicates markets are pricing a 94.6% chance that the Fed will lower rates by 25 bps at the October 29-30 FOMC meeting. ”“With the US shutdown still yet to be resolved, prices are likely to continue upward trajectory where we expect a level of $ 4,105 – 4,150 per oz likely to be tested in spot markets in the short term perspective of 1 – 2 weeks. This could be followed by consolidative moves towards the start of November month. finally translating to an likely upside peak up to Rs. 1,23,800 – 1,24,500 per 10 gm. on MCX futures contract. Any resolution towards the US Shutdown process over the weekend could again bring back profit booking moves in next week,” he adds.","Gold has smashed records by climbing above $4,000. The precious metal is heading towards its strongest yearly gains since the 1970s. Central banks around the world are increasing the percentage of gold reserves in their overall foreign exchange reserves. Investors concerned about the stability of major currencies including the dollar are increasingly shifting their investments towards alternative assets.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124459347,imgsize-43512,width-400,resizemode-4/gold-price.jpg"

Trump EXPLODES Over Xi’s ‘SINISTER’ Trade Move, ‘Cancels’ Key Meeting Amid China’s Rare Earth Tiff

Also read:





US president Donald Trump on Friday accused China of taking a “sinister and hostile” step after Beijing imposed sweeping new export controls on rare earth elements, warning that he could respond with a “massive increase of tariffs” on Chinese goods entering the United States.In a post on Truth Social, the US President said “some very strange things are happening in China”, accusing Beijing of becoming “very hostile” by sending letters to countries around the world announcing plans to impose export controls on critical materials used in global manufacturing. “Nobody has ever seen anything like this,” Trump wrote, adding that such a move would “clog the markets, and make life difficult for virtually every country in the world, especially for China. ”The 47th POTUS said he had not spoken to Xi Jinping and no longer saw a reason to meet him at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit later this month, saying the Chinese letters were “especially inappropriate.” He concluded: “I never thought it would come to this, but perhaps, as with all things, the time has come. Ultimately, though potentially painful, it will be a very good thing, in the end, for the U.S.A.Trump said the move came as a “real surprise” given what he described as a previously “very good” six-month relationship with Beijing. “I have always felt that they’ve been lying in wait, and now, as usual, I have been proven right!” he said. “There is no way that China should be allowed to hold the world ‘captive,’ but that seems to have been their plan for quite some time, starting with the ‘magnets’ and other elements that they have quietly amassed into somewhat of a monopoly position a rather sinister and hostile move, to say the least. ”Beijing’s ministry of commerce announced the new rules on Thursday, requiring special approval for any exports of rare earth elements or products that contain even trace amounts of them. China, which dominates global rare earth production and processing, said the curbs are meant to “safeguard national security.” The restrictions are likely to impact key industries, from defence to electronics, that depend on the minerals.Trump suggested the timing of the Chinese announcement, coinciding with what he called a day of “peace in the Middle East,” was no coincidence. “I wonder if that timing was coincidental?” he wrote. He added that he would “financially counter their move,” warning that Washington was preparing tough measures. “One of the policies that we are calculating at this moment is a massive increase of tariffs on Chinese products coming into the United States of America. There are many other countermeasures that are, likewise, under serious consideration.”",US President Donald Trump accuses China of taking a ‘sinister and hostile’ step after Beijing imposed sweeping new export controls on rare earth elements.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran Udaan until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.Udaan built an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business still accounts for a very small part of India’s overall retail market but can balloon to $150 billion in sales and yield a 100% return on capital invested in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co. estimates published in the Mint newspaper.Bengaluru-based Udaan has also ventured into financing through its fintech unit which helps shopkeepers get working capital loans to buy inventory. That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says. Udaan competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods. The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-105001128,imgsize-151312,width-400,resizemode-4/105001128.jpg"

Budget 2025 income tax expectations: Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman should look to increase the income tax threshold for the 30% tax bracket in her Union Budget 2025, says Adhil Shetty, CEO of BankBazaar.According to BankBazaar, three important income tax changes that need to be brought in Budget 2025 are; raising the 30% income tax threshold to Rs 18 lakh, restructuring tax brackets, and implementing a standardised 30% deduction on gross income.""The 30% tax slab has remained at ₹15 lakh since 2020, despite a 21% rise in the Cost Inflation Index,"" Shetty notes. ""We propose increasing this threshold to ₹18 lakh to reflect inflation and offer relief to urban salaried individuals burdened by rising costs."" This modification would help distribute the tax responsibility more equitably amongst higher-income earners.Also Read | Budget 2025 income tax expectations: Make NPS more attractive - here's how Shetty expresses concerns about solely increasing the tax-free income limit. ""Calls to raise tax-free income to ₹10 lakh are well-intentioned but shift the tax burden to higher earners. Bracket enhancements should be secular, ensuring fairness across all income levels,"" he explains. ""As per the AY2023-24 figures, just 2% of taxpayers contributed 77% of income tax. A balanced approach is necessary.""Regarding diminishing long-term savings and insurance adoption, Shetty observes, ""The absence of deductions in the new tax regime has led to reduced interest in essential financial protections. Life insurance penetration is dropping, and ELSS inflows are falling despite strong equity performance.""Also Read | Budget 2025: Reduce income tax rates, exceptionally high compared to other countries, says Assocham He adds, ""Fewer salaried individuals are engaging with small savings schemes, and interest in NPS remains low.

The incentive to save and to insure—tax deductions—must continue.""Shetty advocates for a 30% flat deduction on gross income with a ₹15 lakh ceiling on deductions.

Union Budget 2025: Travel and Tourism Industry Experts Share Key Expectations,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/union-budget-2025-travel-and-tourism-industry-experts-share-key-expectations/articleshow/117516194.cms,"With the Union Budget 2025 approaching, the anticipation among different sectors is palpable. Growth, innovation, and resilience are the broader expectations from the upcoming budget 2025. If we go to a specific industry, then the travel and tourism sector is looking forward to infrastructural development, better connectivity on both regional and international levels, and reduced taxes are some of the major points. Addressing the evolving needs of the sector industry leaders and experts have shared their pre-budget expectations.In this ever-evolving world, Umesh Chowdhary, VC & MD, Titagarh Rail Systems Ltd. is expecting modernization from the budget 2025. He shares, “We hope the upcoming Union Budget 2025 will continue its focus on the modernization of rolling stock, urban mobility, and infrastructure enhancements. India's metro systems, now among the largest globally, have significantly transformed urban life and mobility. Equally crucial is the continued development of safety, infra, and rolling stock to improve trade connectivity and drive economic growth. We anticipate a strong commitment to the ""Make in India"" initiative and reflective policies within the sector, strengthening domestic manufacturing and boosting exports. We hope that the budget would provide a clear roadmap for India’s transportation future, positioning the nation as a global leader in seamless mobility.”Echoing the same sentiment, Dr. Raghupati Singhania, Chairman & Managing Director, JK Tyre & Industries Ltd says, “FY 2025-26 is likely to play a pivotal role in realizing India’s aspirations. With young India becoming highly mobile, entrepreneurial, and increasingly tech-savvy, the upcoming Union Budget is expected to address their needs by fostering supportive policies and a conducive business environment. Over the last decade, India has demonstrated remarkable progress in physical infrastructure and Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI), and this momentum is bound to accelerate with a focus on last-mile connectivity and infrastructure development in tier-II and III cities as well beyond. A budget emphasizing infrastructure, sustainable mobility, and industrial competitiveness will not only propel the automotive and allied sectors but also significantly contribute to India’s growth story.""On the other hand, Akash Agarwal, Owner, of Rajasthali Resort & Spa is looking forward to some recognition for the sector amid the developing marketplace of India. He shares, “As we anticipate the Union Budget 2025, it is important to emphasize the significant impact of the travel and tourism sector on India's economy, which currently sustains over 40 million jobs and is expected to exceed 62 million in the next ten years. Our expectations for the budget are high, particularly regarding the recognition of the hospitality sector as an industry, which would improve access to financial resources and support. Moreover, permitting GST credits for hotel construction and investing in a strong international campaign under the Incredible India initiative are critical steps. Additionally, revising the tax on rental income will support the growing homestay sector. It is also vital to tackle the GST issues faced by Online Travel Agents and ensure consistent GST rates for online bookings, creating a more equitable and competitive landscape in the tourism industry.”Further, affordable airfare is at the top of the list for Radhika Khanijo, Founder & Private Travel Designer at Welgrow Travel. He says, “There is undoubtedly going to be a surge in international travel. The number of cross-border trips worldwide is expected to rise gradually until 2025. Travel preferences are evolving, with clients increasingly seeking offbeat destinations. Travelers are adding lesser-known spots to their itineraries, looking for unique experiences beyond traditional travel. Additionally, remote working trends are enabling longer stays, allowing travelers to immerse themselves more deeply in destinations.In Budget 2025, we anticipate airlines to restrict significant increases in airfares. As an outbound travel curator, we hope our authorities will address taxation policies, such as reducing GST and waiving off TCS. These measures would allow us to compete on the same platform as international suppliers and foster the competitive nature of our business.Furthermore, investing in sports facilities can position India as a hub for international sporting events, significantly boosting outbound sports tourism.”Last but not least, in inputs provided by Vishal Vincent Tony, Managing Director of Ayatana Hospitality, he mentions, “As 2025 approaches, resorts are looking forward to a budget that supports tourism and helps the hospitality industry thrive. Many hope for lower taxes on stays, which would make luxury getaways more affordable for travellers. Better roads and connectivity to remote destinations are also high on the wish list, making it easier for guests to discover hidden gems.”“Sustainability is becoming a big focus for resorts, so tax breaks or incentives for going green, like using solar power or eco-friendly materials, would be a welcome boost. Training programs for hospitality staff would also help resorts deliver even better guest experiences. Resort Brands are looking for more government backing to upgrade their facilities and enhance their offerings. If the budget focuses on making travel easier, greener, and more affordable, 2025 could be an exciting year for the hospitality world,” he concludes.","With the Union Budget 2025 approaching, the anticipation among different sectors is palpable.

What is Budget halwa ceremony?

Budget 2025 halwa ceremony : Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman attended the customary 'halwa' ceremony on Friday, signalling the commencement of the final phase in preparing the Union Budget 2025-26, scheduled for presentation on February 1 in the Lok Sabha. The ceremony takes place in the North Block basement, where the ministry is situated in the national capital, with the finance minister and senior officials in attendance.FM Sitharaman attended the event, inspected the Budget Press facilities, and conveyed her best wishes to the officials involved in the process.The ceremony was attended by Minister of State for Finance Pankaj Chaudhary, along with senior officials including Finance Secretary Tuhin Kanta Pandey, Economic Affairs Secretary Ajay Seth, and other high-ranking members of the ministry.The budget session of parliament will begin on January 31 and end on April 4, with an inter-session break from February 14. President Droupadi Murmu will address the joint sitting of two houses of Parliament on January 31.The halwa ceremony is a customary ritual observed a few days before the budget presentation in the Parliament, involving the preparation and serving of ""halwa"" to officials and staff involved in the budget's preparation.Following the halwa ceremony, officials involved in drafting the Budget enter a 'lock-in' period, remaining confined within the North Block premises, cut off from external communication, and prohibited from using mobile phones to ensure that Budget details are not leaked before the official presentation in Parliament.According to an ET report, Budget documents are sent for printing after receiving approval from the Prime Minister, and the Intelligence Bureau conducts surprise inspections of the printing press in the ministry's basement to safeguard the process further.This upcoming Budget Presentation will be Sitharaman's eighth budget, surpassing the record set by former Prime Minister Morarji Desai, who presented five annual budgets and one interim budget between 1959 and 1964 as finance minister. Like the previous few full Union Budgets, Budget 2025 will also be delivered in paperless form.The Budget comes in the backdrop of weak GDP numbers and weak consumption in the economy. The Indian economy grew by 5.4 per cent in real terms in the July-September quarter of the current financial year 2024-25, lower than RBI's forecast of 7 per cent. The Reserve Bank, in its latest monetary policy, had cut India's growth forecast for 2024-25 to 6.6 per cent from 7.2 per cent.The Economic Survey tabled in Parliament earlier this year ""conservatively"" projected India's real GDP growth at 6.5-7 per cent for 2024-25, acknowledging that market expectations are higher. India's GDP grew by an impressive 8.2 per cent during the financial year 2023-24 and continued to be the fastest-growing major economy, growing by 7.2 per cent in 2022-23 and 8.7 per cent in 2021-22.","Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman attended the customary 'halwa' ceremony on Friday, signalling the commencement of the final phase in preparing the Union Budget 2025-26.

Policybazaar parent to invest Rs 860 crore for 25% in PB Health,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/policybazaar-parent-to-invest-rs-860-crore-for-25-in-pb-health/articleshow/117587355.cms,"MUMBAI: PB Fintech , the parent company of Policybazaar, will invest around Rs 860 crore for a 25% stake in PB Healthcare , which will set up hospitals with a capacity of 1,000 beds in the first year to provide captive services to buyers of policies with managed healthcare. The objective of the company is to ensure treatment without pre-authorisation, zero rejections, and fully cashless treatment.Speaking to TOI, Yashish Dahiya, co-founder and CEO of PB Fintech, said affordability is going to be a big challenge going forward as the cost of healthcare will rise in future due to new technologies like robotic surgery and the corporatisation of hospitals.""The way to solve this problem is for the insurance companies to have their own partnership. Today, when a company has 14,000 network partners, it cannot control their behaviour,"" said Dahiya.Initially, the hospitals would be set up around NCR and later rolled out to other centres. PB Healthcare is attempting the model of Kaiser Permanente from the US, which operates as an integrated managed care consortium, blending the functions of a healthcare provider and an insurance company. This is similar to the approach taken by Dr. Devi Shetty's Narayana Health Insurance. However, unlike Narayana, which issues policies on its own books, PB Healthcare will serve customers of other companies.The PB Healthcare model would include a layer of general practitioners who would not receive any referral fee.","PB Fintech will invest around Rs 860 crore for a 25% stake in PB Healthcare.

Study: Women occupy just 19% of C-suite roles,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/study-women-occupy-just-19-of-c-suite-roles/articleshow/117587053.cms,"NEW DELHI: Despite efforts by India Inc and regulations to address gender diversity, women still occupy just 19% of C-suite roles in India, far below the global average of 30%, highlighting the need for targeted talent search initiatives.A key barrier preventing women from accessing and excelling in these leadership positions is work-life integration, with around 60% of respondents citing it as a major challenge, a research by Avtar, a workplace culture consulting firm, shared exclusively with TOI says.This underscores the necessity of systemic changes that extend beyond hiring and promotion processes to better support women's advancement in leadership.Saundarya Rajesh, founder-president Avtar group, said, ""Our research reveals that multiple factors continue to limit the advancement of women to the C-suite. Given the systemic barriers that affect women in India more acutely, an effective approach to bridge the gender gap is through targeted diversity-driven executive searches. These searches offer customised and comprehensive strategies to ensure an equitable recruitment and advancement process.""What's concerning is the rising attrition at the senior leadership level, which increased from 4% in 2019 to 10% in 2020, largely due to the pandemic's impact on women's careers. Although a slight recovery was observed, it rose again to 10% in 2022, reflecting ongoing challenges in retaining women in senior roles.In 2023, the rate improved slightly to 9%. It further decreased to 8% in following year, indicating incremental progress in addressing attrition, but it still remains above pre-pandemic levels, the study adds.Additionally, gender bias in hiring and promotion continues to hinder women's progress, with 44% of respondents pointing to this issue. Many believe that leveraging data and AI could play a crucial role in mitigating this bias and creating more equitable opportunities for women in leadership roles.To address this, a majority of respondents feel that organisational culture needs to improve for women to thrive in leadership roles. Another significant barrier to increasing women's representation in leadership is the shortage of qualified candidates. Around 41% of respondents cite the unavailability of women talent as a key factor contributing to the skewed gender diversity. This issue ties into challenges related to organisational culture, gender bias, and work-life integration, all of which must be addressed to create meaningful change.","Despite efforts by India Inc and regulations to address gender diversity, women still occupy just 19% of C-suite roles in India.

"Income tax relief? Govt looks to raise threshold, restructure slabs",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/income-tax-relief-govt-looks-to-raise-threshold-restructure-slabs/articleshow/117587164.cms,"NEW DELHI: Amid expectations of a relief in income tax in the Budget, govt is keen to keep the new tax regime free of concessions, while it looks at raising the threshold and offering concessions through a rejig of slabs.Income tax rates are usually among the last set of announcements to be finalised and typically ahead of every Budget a case is made to rework them. This year is no different with companies and economists citing weak demand to make a case for lowering the liability, particularly for the middle class. Last year, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman had enhanced the standard deduction for the salaried to Rs 75,000 and also revised the slabs and said that all the changes announced by her would result in a Rs 17,500 gain.In the run up to next year's Budget, which will be presented on Saturday, there have been discussions in govt to raise the standard deduction further, a move that is seen to provide relief to all taxpayers. And, to deal with growing clamour for leaving more money in the pockets of middle-class consumers, proposals around lowering the liability across slabs, including the ones for the higher income segments, have been discussed.While the Centre is focused on tweaking the rates in the new tax regime, a case is also being made to provide higher concessions for spends such as health insurance and pension, seen to be crucial in a country like India where individuals, barring those in govt, have to fend for themselves. The demand in some quarters is to bring down the curtains on the old tax regime, which is seen to be beneficial to those with allowances, such as house rent allowance, and home loans.SBI report, for instance, has made a case for providing exemptions for health insurance of up to Rs 50,000 and for NPS contribution of up to Rs 75,000 or Rs 1 lakh. In case the peak rate is retained at 30% with a 15% levy for those with taxable income of Rs 10-15 lakh (against 20% for Rs 12-15 lakh at present), then the Centre stands to lose Rs 16,000 crore to Rs 50,000 crore annually. It has also argued for changes in tax treatment of interest income.In case the peak rate is cut from 30% to 25% for those with annual taxable income of Rs 15 lakh or more along with health insurance exemption of Rs 50,000 and NPS contribution of Rs 75,000 a year, then the revenue hit works out to Rs 74,000 crore to just under Rs 1.1 lakh crore.In the third scenario, where the peak rate is cut to 25% along with a 15% levy for those with Rs 10-15 lakh income along with the exemption of Rs 50,000 for health cover and Rs 75,000 for NPS, the report has pegged revenue loss at Rs 85,000 crore to Rs 1.2 lakh crore.There have also been suggestions to provide benefits for home loans under the new tax regime. Govt officials are, however, averse to introducing concessions and exemptions, arguing that it would result in the new regime slowly going back to its predecessor. At the same time, they suggested that the option should be available and taxpayers can select the one that is beneficial for them.","Income tax rates are usually among the last set of announcements to be finalised.

Startup founders get into 'reboot' mode,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/startup-founders-get-into-reboot-mode/articleshow/117587301.cms,"BENGALURU: A rising number of Indian startup founders are stepping away from their ventures to start afresh. While reasons vary, they often stem from personal and professional challenges, including co-founder disagreements, dwindling passion for the original problem statement, time constraints, and intensifying market pressures.As the Indian startup ecosystem grapples with a funding winter and increasingly competitive market dynamics, founder departures are becoming a symbol of both the challenges and opportunities in a rapidly evolving landscape. Recent high-profile exits underscore this shift. Founders at Dunzo, a hyperlocal delivery platform, and PharmEasy, a leading health-tech startup, departed amidst turbulent times marked by funding constraints and operational challenges at these firms.Last year, Unacademy co-founder Hemesh Singh and Upgrad co-founder Mayank Kumar stepped down from the respective edtech unicorns. ""One of the biggest reasons why we have seen founders in the Indian startup ecosystem splitting up is because the company has some shift in its path and has subverted its vision,"" Siddharth Pai, founding partner of 3one4 Capital, said.The proverbial funding winter - marked by a significant slowdown in venture capital inflows - further exacerbated the pressures on Indian startups. Following years of aggressive scaling fuelled by readily available capital, founders are now contending with tightened funding pipelines and heightened investor scrutiny.""The market was very buoyant in 2020-21. Startups raised a lot of capital and growth projections were very robust and investors wanted delivery on these, but it was extremely difficult given the macro-economic changes... there were huge tailwinds for edtech,"" Madhur Nevatia, partner at executive search firm Longhouse Consulting, told TOI.According to data from industry trackers, venture funding in India fell sharply in 2023, with startups forced to focus on cost-cutting, operational efficiency, and paths to profitability. Data from Venture Intelligence showed that startups raised $8 billion in 2023, touching a six-year low. For many founders, the inability to secure fresh funding or align with changing investor priorities created insurmountable challenges, prompting some to step aside.The funding crunch also exposed deeper structural issues within some startups, from unsustainable business models to over-ambitious valuations. In such scenarios, founders often find themselves caught between recalibrating strategies and managing investor expectations, a dynamic that can lead to burnout, loss of motivation, or disagreements over the company's direction. ""Sometimes it is also that the stage of the company is such that it no longer meets your skillset in the larger scheme of things. With the entire structure entirely changing, one may no longer be relevant,"" Nevatia added.Market analysts suggest that these exits are part of the ecosystem's broader maturation, with founders becoming more willing to acknowledge when a venture is no longer viable or aligned with their aspirations. Unlike the early days of the startup boom, when perseverance was seen as a badge of honour, today's founders are more likely to prioritise personal well-being and professional reinvention.While some transitions are part of planned leadership changes aimed at bringing in operational expertise or fresh perspectives, others stem from unresolvable tensions within leadership teams or external pressures that force tough decisions. Ola co-founder Ankit Bhati left Ola in 2018, when it was primarily a cab aggregator. This was just a year before Ola Electric was founded and took away a significant focus on part of the parent company's leadership bandwidth. Multiple changes also occurred at Zomato, in the face of relentless demands of leading a public company. Co-founder Akriti Chopra resigned last year. Chopra joined a list of three other co-founders who exited the company from 2018 to 2023 - Pankaj Chaddah, Mohit Gupta, and Gunjan Patidar.","A rising number of Indian startup founders are stepping away from their ventures to start afresh.

United G20 can navigate geopolitical tensions: Kant,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/united-g20-can-navigate-geopolitical-tensions-kant/articleshow/117587401.cms,"What were the gains for economy from India's presidency of G20?

India showcased

digital public infrastructure

as a key theme at the meet. How successful was it ?

Did India's threat to walk out from G20 help in forging consensus with the New Delhi declaration?

How do you see the future of G20 given the geopolitical tensions?

India stands to gain significantly from its presidency of the G20, says Amitabh Kant , the country's G20 Sherpa. In his latest book ""How India scaled MT G20,"" Kant recounts the enormous efforts, including intense negotiations that were mounted to make it a success. In an interview to TOI, Kant talks on a range of issues, including the future of G20, amid geopolitical tensions. Excerpts:India's presidency of the G20 resulted in significant economic gains that will be felt for years to come. The leadership role allowed India to showcase its strengths, enhancing its global image and positioning it as a key player in shaping international economic policies. We opened doorways for attracting FDI, particularly from large multinational corporations looking for emerging markets. It has also positioned the country as a global hub for the MICE (Meetings, Incentives, Conferences, and Exhibitions) industry. Hosting over 220 meetings across 60 cities with more than 100,000 participants demonstrates India's capability to manage large-scale international events. World-class venues like Bharat Mandapam and Yashobhoomi have gained international attention. Currently, India holds less than 1% of the $500 billion global MICE tourism market, but with enhanced infrastructure, India should aim to host every major global convention and exhibition. Establishing convention bureaus and improving destination management will be key steps towards realising this potential in MICE sector.India's spotlight on digital public infrastructure (DPI) at G20 proved highly successful, and the world has taken notice. After years of being overshadowed by big tech monopolies, India worked tirelessly throughout the year to demonstrate that there's a better, more inclusive model for tech-driven growth at scale. India's Unified Payments Interface (UPI) has already seen its implementation in Sri Lanka and Mauritius. India is in discussions with the US, regarding potential links between UPI and American private banks, indicating that the impact of DPI is not limited solely to the Global South, but is also being recognised by developed nations looking to enhance payment networks.India's threat to walk out of G20 discussions was not merely a negotiating tactic. It was a direct reflection of Prime Minister Modi's stance that consensus must be a shared responsibility among all member nations. He had told me that following the failures of other global institutions like the UN and UNSC, it would be tragic if the G20 also failed to reach consensus. During our discussions, the PM had made it clear that if the G20 doesn't work responsibly, India would seek responsible collaboration through other forums - because consensus for development was our primary objective, and that must be achieved at all costs.Future of the G20 depends on maintaining this approach. As PM Modi envisioned for India's G20 presidency , we must remain inclusive, ambitious, action-oriented, and decisive. By working on unity among developed and developing economies, we can navigate geopolitical tensions and deepen cooperation, ensuring the G20 remains a relevant and effective platform.","India's presidency of the G20 resulted in significant economic gains that will be felt for years to come.

Govt proposes hike in tax rebate on new vehicles for buyers scrapping old ones,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/govt-proposes-hike-in-tax-rebate-on-new-vehicles-for-buyers-scrapping-old-ones/articleshow/117587233.cms,"Poll Should Tax Rebates Be Offered for Scrapping Old Vehicles? No, It's Unnecessary Yes, It's a Good Incentive

NEW DELHI: In a move to persuade people to scrap their BS-I and BS-II vehicles, and those which are older than these, the road transport ministry has proposed to hike the motor vehicle tax rebate by up to 50% on purchase of new automobiles for buyers submitting the scrapping certificate of their old vehicles.While the BS-I emission norm for vehicles became mandatory in 2000, BS-II came into effect from 2002. Sources said the tax relief, proposed in a draft notification issued on Jan 24, is aimed at encouraging people to retire their old polluting vehicles, a step which will help curb vehicular pollution. At present, people get up to 25% discount in the MV tax while buying a new vehicle after submitting the scrapping certificate of their old personal vehicles. The rebate is up to 15% in the case of commercial vehicles.As per the proposed norm, up to 50% discount would be applicable for all vehicles — commercial and personal — that are BS-I or were manufactured before the BS norms were introduced. This discount would be applicable in the case of BS-II vehicles that fall under the medium and heavy private and transport vehicles categories. This means scrapping of a BS-II car won't get this benefit and only get the up to 25% rebate.This proposed change comes amid indications of the govt putting in place a series of measures to get rid of pre-BS, BS-I and BS-II vehicles as they cause more air pollution compared to BS-IV and BS-VI vehicles.""The efforts are to see that people scrap their old vehicles on their own, rather than making that (this practice) mandatory. Going by fuel efficiency and other parameters like safety, it's better to get a new vehicle and scrapping old ones,"" said a source.Officials said the increased discount in the MV tax will also motivate people to scrap their vehicles that are lying as junk, as the scrapping certificate they get from the discarding process can be ‘sold’ or ‘traded’ for benefits like rebates on new registration certificates.","The road transport ministry has proposed to hike the motor vehicle tax rebate by up to 50% on purchase of new automobiles.

The nine patients were added after they exhibited symptoms such as acute muscle weakness and an inability to walk properly, both signs of GBS onset, officials said.Also on Saturday, the state public health laboratory in Pune identified bacterial contamination in untreated water from a well near Khadakwasla Dam in the Nanded area, one of the affected locations.The water sample from the well showed contamination with E. coli and coliform bacteria, with coliform bacterial counts exceeding 16 per 100 ml of water and that of E. coli being 9 per 100 ml.""This makes the well water unsafe. But there's no way to confirm whether this water was being used by anyone or not, and for what purpose,"" a senior official from the health department told TOI.A total of 11 water samples were collected, including water from various household taps in affected areas. Except for the sample from the well, all other sources were found safe for consumption, officials said.Officials are still trying to find the lead trigger for the GBS cluster in Pune. Tests so far by private labs and the National Institute of Virology (NIV) have found presence of the bacteria Campylobacter jejuni (C. jejuni) and norovirus in patient samples. Norovirus is prevalent, but rarely causes GBS. It's Campylobacter jejuni that public health experts are worried about as it's the single-most common organism found associated with GBS. GBS due to C. jejuni infection is also usually more severe.Experts have also conducted tests to rule out other viral triggers of GBS. On Saturday, blood samples of 23 GBS patients tested negative for Zika, Dengue and Chikungunya — all capable of causing GBS in cases of severe infection.Out of the 73 patients, 25 are below 19 years of age and 16 are over 60. At least 13 patients are below 9 years of age. Fourteen of these patients are still on ventilator support. Three patients diagnosed after Jan 9 have been discharged, officials said.A central team that was to be dispatched to Pune was yet to arrive on Saturday. But representatives of central health bodies who're already in Pune have teamed up with local authorities to investigate the city's GBS spike.""The team from Delhi is yet to arrive but they do have a few representatives who sit in Pune and who've been in touch with us,"" said Dr Babita Kamlapurkar, joint director of state health services.She added: ""The nine suspected patients were identified on Saturday. We have visited affected areas including main water sources at Sinhagad Road and Kirkatwadi. We will also review all diagnoses to see if we need to revise Pune's GBS patient count so far.""PMC's health department chief Dr Neena Borade said residents have been advised to avoid eating food at unhygienic places. ""It's also important to boil all drinking water and heat food before consumption,"" she said.The health department also released a chart showing a dip in daily cases, after the Jan 20 peak when more than 10 patients with GBS were reported in a single day.At least 18,000 homes have been surveyed in the affected areas, officials said.

Justin Trudeau warns Donald Trump over tariff threat,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/prices-for-americans-will-go-up-trudeau-warns-trump-over-tariff-threat/articleshow/117503660.cms,"Justin Trudeau and Donald Trump (R)

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Thursday warned that American consumers will face higher prices if US President Donald Trump proceeds with plans to impose sweeping tariffs on Canadian products.Trump announced earlier in the day that he intends to apply a 25% tariff on imports from Canada and Mexico, with implementation potentially starting as soon as February 1. He had previously threatened to impose sweeping new tariffs on Mexico, Canada, and China immediately after taking office, but they were not implemented on his first day.Speaking in Ottawa, outgoing PM Trudeau pointed out that Canada would respond with retaliatory tariffs if Trump moves forward. ""Whether it be back on January 20th, on February 1st or February 15th as a Valentine’s Day present, or on April 1st or whenever, Canada will respond,"" Trudeau said. ""Prices for American consumers on just about everything will go up. We don’t think he wants that.""The tariffs would target a wide range of products and could disrupt key markets, including autos, lumber, and oil. Alberta Premier Danielle Smith cautioned that Americans in some states could see gas prices increase by more than a dollar per gallon if Canadian oil faces additional tariffs. Despite Trump’s assertion that the US does not need Canada, nearly 25% of America’s daily oil consumption is supplied by its northern neighbour.Canada is also a critical supplier of 34 essential minerals and metals, as well as the largest foreign source of steel, aluminium, and uranium for the US Trudeau highlighted the importance of bilateral cooperation.""The US should be working even more with Canada on our energy, on our critical minerals, on the goods they need to deliver the economic growth that Donald Trump has promised,"" he said. ""That is our first choice. If they do move forward on tariffs, we are ready to respond in a strong way but in a way to figure out how to get them removed as soon as possible.""Canada is reportedly considering retaliatory tariffs on US products such as orange juice, toilets, and certain steel goods. This would mirror the response in 2018, when Canada imposed billions of dollars in duties after Trump raised tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum. ""Everything is on the table,” Trudeau said. “It would be bad for Canada, but it would also be bad for American consumers.""The economic relationship between the two countries is significant, with nearly Canadian dollars 3.6 billion ($2.7 billion) in goods and services crossing the border daily. Canada is also the top export destination for 36 US states. However, Trump has remained focused on border issues, linking Canada and Mexico to the flow of fentanyl into the US""We have highlighted that less than one percent of illegal drugs coming into the United States, less than one percent of migrants going into the United States, come from Canada, but we’re still investing over a billion dollars and strengthening our border,"" Trudeau said.Trump has also frequently mischaracterised the US-Canada trade relationship, claiming a $200 billion trade deficit, which experts have debunked.

I did it with Saudi Arabia last time because they agreed to buy $450 billion worth of our products,” Trump told journalists in the Oval Office.“If Saudi Arabia wanted to buy another $450 billion or $500 — we’ll up it for all the inflation — I think I’d probably go.”During his first term, Trump broke tradition by making Saudi Arabia, rather than the UK, his first international destination in 2017.The visit also highlighted close relations with the supreme leaders of oil rich Gulf states and presence of his real estate empire across the regions.The public run Saudi Press Agency, stated that the investment was discussed during a telephonic conversation between Trump and the de facto ruler of the oil-rich kingdom.“The crown prince affirmed the kingdom’s intention to broaden its investments and trade with the United States over the next four years, in the amount of $600 billion, and potentially beyond that,” the report stated.However, it did not specify the details of the investment.In recent years, the US has drawn away from reliance on Saudi’s oil exports which had been the foundation of their close ties for decades.At present, Saudi sovereign wealth funds have taken large stakes in American businesses while also looking at sports as well.The White House did not comment on the call.The crown prince also spoke with US secretary of state Marco Rubio.Trump maintained close ties with Saudi Arabia, even after the 2018 killing and dismemberment of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi in Istanbul, which was linked to the crown prince.",Saudi Arabia’s crown prince Mohammed bin Salman on Thursday announced that he is looking forward to investing a staggering $600 billion in the United States in the upcoming four years.

After a significant rally, Solana is once again making headlines. The recent launch of a spectacularly successful meme coin helped SOL reach its all-time high yet again. Speculators predict further growth, but several challengers are rising fast.For one, a new TON-based token has the potential to rival this success. Thanks to its significant utility and systemic importance, this token could be a top performer this cycle.After a major rally at the start of the bull market, Solana (SOL) is once again in the headlines. The “Ethereum killer” has attained new highs thanks to a major memecoin launch. Namely, just days before his inauguration, President Donald Trump launched the Official Trump (TRUMP) token. The token quickly attained a staggering valuation of $10 billion, making Trump one of the richest men alive.The token’s launch on Solana has created a market frenzy, pushing Solana to its new ATH at $290. Despite the subsequent volatility, Solana is still up 42% over the past seven days, trading at $254. Now, experts predict that the token can go even higher.The launch of Trump and Melania tokens on the network will likely boost its credibility. At the same time, Trump’s favourable stance toward crypto may prove to be even more consequential. If Solana cements its position as the meme coin hub, it has further potential to expand.Despite Solana’s significant growth, it is not without its challenges. Among them is TON , another high-performance blockchain with several aces up its sleeve. For one, TON has a deep connection with the Telegram messaging app.Telegram provides TON with access to its 950 million users. At the same time, it also enables real-world applications for the network. For one, TON-based apps are becoming more popular on Telegram. For example, popular clicker apps like Notcoin drew significant engagement.TON is also expanding into several new areas. Just in time for the next meme coin rally, TON has revealed a major partnership. Ethereum-based GraFun memecoin launchpad has recently joined the TON platform. This platform will enable the easy creation of meme coins on TON, just as Pump.fun did for Solana.Thanks to these developments, TON emerges as a potential Solana challenger. Moreover, the recent launch of Elluminex (ELX) could further boost its potential. The project aims to be the main trading hub for TON, injecting much-needed liquidity into the chain.Elluminex works as a DEX with cross-chain bridges to 40 major blockchains. This way, it helps bring together liquidity across major chains. This is crucial, as the introduction of major DEXs has had a significant impact on token prices.For instance, since the launch of Raydium, Solana grew from $1.5 to more than $200 in a single year. Ethereum saw similar effects after the launch of Uniswap, as did BNB with PancakeSwap. These examples showcase the importance of liquidity for the chains.Elluminex will also enable low-slippage trading with self-custody, appealing both to large traders and retail players. Thanks to the fact that the project is still in its early stages, it has the potential to more than rival Solana’s performance.","After a significant rally, Solana is once again making headlines.

With a startling $190 trillion worth, the global payments sector is about to undergo a significant change as one viral altcoin is causing waves. The promising project Remittix ( RTX ), which combines blockchain technology with local payment networks, is addressing ongoing cross-border problems like sluggish processing times and excessive costs.But should Cardano (ADA) exhibit indications of a possible recovery, could this fresh rival challenge other top crypto coins and flip ADA's position? Remittix might be the crypto initiative that changes our perspective on cross-border transactions this year. Read on to find out why RTX has the potential to surpass ADA.Rising momentum makes Cardano (ADA) among the top altcoins to keep an eye on this year. Though there were occasional swings, the Cardano price increased more than 16% during the past week, showing a bullish momentum. At first, the Cardano price chart showed a bullish trend with higher highs and higher lows. But a brief bearish breakout saw the altcoin drop to $0.98 before rebounding with great positive momentum, moving it to the $1.09 resistance zone.The Cardano price has been steadily rising over the previous month, rising by more than 16% and keeping a good view among the crypto community. Though it still stands over 65% behind its all-time high (ATH) of $3.10, hope regarding a possible ATH retest in 2025 keeps rising. Reflecting a good blend of stability and growth, Cardano (ADA) noted green days in 53% of the last 30 days.Cardano (ADA) is still among the promising altcoins to watch given its strong fundamentals and bullish investor sentiment. Reiterating the positive sentiment shown on the Cardano price chart, indicators including the MACD, Momentum Oscillator, and Moving Averages flash buy signals However, the Commodity Channel Index (CCI) currently shows sale signals, indicating a possible pullback. Looking forward, analysts are bullish on Cardano (ADA) in 2025. A recent 2025 Cardano price prediction forecasts that the altcoin could trade in a price channel between $1 and $5 on average this year.Remittix is emerging as a promising project at a time when cross-border transactions are sometimes hampered by hefty fees and delayed processing periods. Moreover, Remittix provides a more affordable, efficient means for individuals and companies to transmit money all around the world by merging local payment systems with blockchain technology, therefore bridging cryptocurrencies and traditional banks.The desire for creative ideas like Remittix has never been stronger since the worldwide remittance market exceeds $750 billion yearly. Among the best crypto investment prospects, Remittix is likely to take a sizable chunk of this fast-growing industry. Meanwhile, Remittix distinguishes itself from conventional financial systems by offering low fees and being transparent.Furthermore, Remittix guarantees users know exactly what they will pay upfront, unlike traditional banking systems loaded with hidden costs, excessive fees, and long delays. Remittix has addressed one of the most enduring issues in global payments by supporting more than forty cryptocurrencies and giving users the option to convert them to fiat and forward them to any bank account anywhere in the world.Remittix is well suited to profit from the rising need for quick, safe, competitively cost cross-border payment solutions. Investors are quite interested in the platform since its presale has already raised over $4.6 million and sold more than 252 million RTX tokens in a few weeks. Early buyers have a unique chance to join the presale at a shockingly low price of just $0.0256 per RTX token before the expected launch on tier-1 exchanges in the coming weeks.Remittix (RTX) is fast establishing itself as a game-changer in cross-border payments as the competition for dominance in the crypto arena gets more intense. Moreover, Remittix promises faster, less expensive, and more transparent solutions than conventional banking systems.Additionally, Remittix is a project worth investing in given an increasing presale success and a great chance to take a sizable portion of the $750 billion remittance market. Even though Cardano (ADA) is exhibiting indications of recovery, it is evident that the massive investor demand for the limited RTX token supply is poised to result in exponential gains shortly.Join the Remittix (RTX) presale and community:","Remittix (RTX) is transforming cross-border transactions.

He expressed his support for legal immigration, stating that the country would need more workers to support manufacturing growth due to his tariff policies.""I'm fine with legal immigration.

Time to speak openly and plainly

Global Shapers

and decisions about the future

Looking for solutions and social accountability

The protest is small but loud. As limousines drive past, a few hundred young people have gathered on the Postplatz square in Davos, Switzerland.The high-altitude resort in the Alps that usually belongs to skiers looks different this week. Bakeries, cafes, and boutiques have been converted to host banks, companies, or whole countries for the next few days.A pub is now called ""Belgium House."" The old furniture has been cleared out and chic designer furniture and large advertising posters have been put in their place.The demonstrators outside shout ""Eat the rich"" and ""Tax the rich."" Some of them block the street. Their protest is directed at the participants of the World Economic Forum (WEF). They see the meeting, which runs from January 20-24, as a complete waste of money and time.""We are protesting against the lobby meeting of the rich and powerful in Davos. It is clear that they are the ones responsible for the current crises,"" says Mirjam Hostetmann from the youth organization Young Socialists Switzerland, which is connected to the Social Democratic Party of Switzerland. The group is helping organize the demonstration under the motto ""Strike WEF.""Ines Yabar has a slightly different view of the event.The young Peruvian was invited as a guest to the World Economic Forum this year. In Lima, she works with others to protect the environment, addresses social problems, and is active as a Global Shaper. This global network of young, committed people between the ages of 20 and 30 is supported by the WEF but organizes itself independently.In Davos, Yabar wants to discuss things with those in power and build bridges, but she also plans to speak plainly. At the same time, she can understand why there are demonstrations outside.""I feel that this shows that young people care and wherever we can we will be protesting because it is important to raise our voice about issues we are passionate about,"" says Yabar. ""But we will also be in rooms where we can talk with people deliberately and intentionally that are making decisions that affect our future.""This year, 50 Global Shapers from around the world will take part in the discussions in Davos.They will discuss social justice , climate change, artificial intelligence (AI) and many other important topics.Being present in Davos is an opportunity for many, especially since many young people are dissatisfied. The current situation cannot continue, says Olajumoke Adekeye.The Nigerian member of the Global Shapers Community is appalled because only 2.8% of the world's parliamentarians are under the age of 30, she says. In sub-Saharan Africa, a large proportion of the population is under 25, but when it comes to decisions that affect their future, they are not heard. And that's why she is here.Indeed, for the next few days her schedule is full. She will need all her energy to meet her mandate of ""seeding ideas about how young people can be empowered to take on greater responsibility.""""Together both the youth within these walls and outside send a strong message that there is really change that can be made,"" says Adekeye, when asked about being a part of a youth delegation inside the WEF while young people protested outside.Akshay Saxena from India also believes in the power of the young and is looking for change.""Too many decisions for the majority are made by a very small group of people,"" he says.He supports young talent through the organization Avanti Fellows where he is co-CEO. They focus on children from poor families who have little access to the education system.""There are so many bright kids, exceptional people, their talent is often wasted,"" he muses. For his work, Saxena is being honored as the Social Entrepreneur of the Year at this year's WEF meeting.""If capitalism is going to work, it is critical that people who own a lot, share some of their wealth. That is their social responsibility,"" he says.Around 70,000 young Indians have taken part in Avanti Fellows' online courses on mathematics, technology, and various science subjects. Others receive targeted support in schools through the organization's programs.Saxena proudly reports on participants who graduated from the renowned Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the US after receiving funding. ""My approach is solution-based,"" he says, pulling a blanket closer to keep himself warm.His gaze wanders over the Swiss mountains. ""Problems should be solved by people who are most affected,"" says Saxena, reflecting on the issues at hand.

Australian e-commerce platform Catch is looking to shut down, resulting in approximately 200 job losses due to heightened rivalry from Amazon and Temu.Wesfarmers , which acquired the online retailer for $230million in 2019, issued a closure announcement on Tuesday.According to a Daily Mail report, the company expects an operational deficit reaching $40million in the initial half of 2024-25.“While Catch's financial performance has been challenging, we have gained valuable insights and capabilities that have accelerated the group's digital transformation and supported the development of the OnePass membership program,” Daily Mail quoted Wesfarmers managing director Rob Scott as saying.The company cited intense rivalry from international online retailers such as Temu, Shein, and Amazon.“The recent increase in competitive intensity in the Australian e-commerce sector has affected Catch's financial performance and growth prospects,” according to the announcement.Whilst 100 positions will be preserved and transferred to other Wesfarmers subsidiaries like Kmart, 190 positions will be eliminated.The logistics centres will transition to Kmart's control during the final quarter of 2024-25.Kmart Group Managing Director Ian Bailey indicated the arrangement would enhance customer service through access to Catch's Moorebank warehouse in Sydney's south-west.“Kmart Group can better utilise Catch's fulfilment centres, which are currently less than 50 per cent utilised. The transition will result in faster deliveries to customers at a lower unit cost, while relieving pressure on our busy stores,” he explained.Established by Gabby and Hezi Leibovich as Catch of the Day in 2006, the business gained popularity amongst value-conscious Australian shoppers but ultimately struggled against competitors who faced fewer operational costs and taxes.","Australian e-commerce platform Catch is looking to shut down, resulting in approximately 200 job losses.

Wealth extraction from India



Impact on India's economy and society



Multinational and colonial exploitation



Continuing Inequities



Colonialism's lasting impact



Global South struggles



A new report by Oxfam International , titled 'Takers, Not Makers,' reveals staggering figures on wealth extracted from India by Britain during the colonial era, claiming that $64.82 trillion was taken between 1765 and 1900. Of this, $33.8 trillion, which is more than half of the total wealth, adjusted for today’s value, is said to have enriched the UK’s richest 10%.Released at the World Economic Forum ’s annual meeting in Davos, the report pointed out colonialism’s lasting impact on inequality and economic systems. ""Legacies of inequality and pathologies of plunder, pioneered during the time of historical colonialism , continue to shape modern lives,"" Oxfam said.The report also specified that colonial practices perpetuated systemic wealth extraction from the Global South to the Global North, benefiting a select elite. “This has created a deeply unequal world, a world torn apart by division based on racism, a world that continues to systematically extract wealth from the Global South to primarily benefit the richest people in the Global North,” the report said.Oxfam calculated that the wealth extracted from India alone by Britain could carpet London’s surface area in £50 currency notes nearly four times. ""This would be enough to carpet the surface area of London in British pound 50 notes almost four times over,"" the report mentioned.The wealth extraction, Oxfam claimed, not only enriched the wealthiest 10% but also majorly benefited Britain’s emerging middle class, which received 32% of this income.The report details how India’s share of global industrial output dropped precipitously from 25% in 1750 to just 2% by 1900, primarily due to Britain’s protectionist policies targeting Asian textiles. ""This dramatic reduction can be attributed to Britain's implementation of stringent protectionist policies against Asian textiles, which systematically undermined India's industrial growth potential,"" the report added.During World War I , disruptions in colonial trade patterns inadvertently stimulated industrial growth in colonies, disclosing how external shocks temporarily alleviated colonial suppression.Oxfam also linked modern multinational corporations to colonial practices, tracing their origins to entities like the British East India Company . ""The concept of private multinational corporations, bankrolled by rich shareholders, was a product of the colonial era,” Oxfam stated, adding that these corporations employed private armies to suppress resistance.The East India Company alone had an army of 260,000 soldiers, double the size of Britain’s peacetime army, who engaged in land dispossession and violent repression.The report highlighted modern parallels, stating that wages in the Global South are 87–95% lower than for equivalent work in the Global North. It also mentioned the exploitation of natural resources and poor working conditions in supply chains dominated by multinational corporations.Oxfam also targeted global institutions like the WTO and World Bank for perpetuating inequities. “The inequality that these countries experience today is significantly of colonial making,” the report said.Oxfam also addressed the societal divisions entrenched during colonial rule, such as caste, religion, and language. For instance, it pointed out that only 0.14% of India’s mother tongues are used as mediums of instruction.The report further pointed out the devastating Bengal famine of 1943, which resulted in an estimated three million deaths. “Grain import restrictions during World War Two, underpinned by racist thinking, appear to have significantly contributed to or caused the Bengal famine,” Oxfam stated.Oxfam detailed how colonialism’s legacy continues to affect public services, education, and health in the Global South. It cited biopiracy, as seen in the case of neem, and the systemic exploitation of resources.Calling colonialism’s impact a “fruit from the poisoned tree,” Oxfam summed up its report stating that global inequality remains deeply rooted in the historical practices of extraction and exploitation.","Oxfam says $64.82 trillion was taken from India by Britain between 1765 and 1900. Of this, $33.8 trillion is said to have enriched the UK’s richest 10%. Oxfam says colonial practices perpetuated systemic wealth extraction from the Global South to the Global North.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117388573,imgsize-410043,width-400,resizemode-4/117388573.jpg"

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume.While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance.

today:

Gold prices remain firm, hovering near the $4,500 level on COMEX. Meanwhile, silver continues its strong upward momentum, supported by tight supply conditions, robust industrial demand, and broader market uncertainties. Recent US economic data indicated easing inflation and softer labor market conditions, strengthening expectations of multiple rate cuts next year, even as GDP growth surprised on the upside.Gold prices are gradually trending higher, consistent with their typical behaviour, and have registered a record high of ₹140,000 following a consolidation breakout from the ₹135,000 level last week. The broader technical structure continues to favor a buy-on-dips strategy, preferably through staggered investments.There remains a possibility of prices re-testing the recent support zone between ₹137,000 and ₹138,000.After the breakout, prices have been holding near the upper Bollinger Band, indicating sustained buying interest, with the mid-band around ₹135,000 acting as an immediate stop.Any pullbacks may be used for accumulation, while a decisive move above ₹140,000 could open the way toward targets of ₹143,000–₹145,000.It is a holiday-shortened week due to the New Year, though a few key events are lined up. Focus will be on US industrial production, housing numbers and FOMC meeting minutes.","Manav Modi, Senior Analyst, Commodity Research at Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd.

The advance-decline ratio was far in favour of declines and this led to decline in Nifty by 100 points yesterday. But it is important to note that this decline happened on thin volumes. A clear directional change will happen only early in the new year when large institutions are back in action. ”“It would be better for investors to watch the market now and wait for new triggers and new directional moves. However, weakness in the market can be used to nibble at high quality large caps. The auto sales numbers expected in two days will give an indication of the sustainability of the consumption boom in the economy.This is significant from the economic growth perspective, too.”Global cues were mixed as Wall Street’s key indices ended lower on Monday, starting the final week of the year on a weak note. The decline was led by heavyweight technology stocks, which retreated after last week’s rally had pushed the S&P 500 to record highs.Asian markets on Tuesday mirrored the cautious sentiment, with a seven day rally in regional stocks coming to a pause as technology led losses in the US spilled over. Precious metals also showed volatility, with gold and silver fluctuating after slipping from fresh all time highs.In currency markets, the US dollar traded steady on Tuesday ahead of the Federal Reserve’s release of minutes from its December policy meeting.On the domestic front, foreign portfolio investors continued to pare their exposure, selling equities worth Rs 2,760 crore on Monday.

PAN-Aadhaar Deadline Nears: How To Link Before December 31 Or Risk Inoperative PAN From Next Year

How to link PAN with Aadhaar card: Step-by-step guide

To begin with, you will have to pay a mandatory fee through the Income Tax Department’s e-Filing portal.

Visit the portal homepage (https://www.incometax.gov.in/iec/foportal/), select the Link Aadhaar option under Quick Links. Now enter your PAN card and Aadhaar card details.

After choosing to pay through e-Pay Tax, you are required to re-enter your PAN, verify your mobile number through an OTP, select the Income Tax option, and proceed to payment.

The assessment year must be selected and the payment category should be marked as Other Receipts (500). The Rs 1,000 amount is auto-filled and can be paid using net banking, debit card, or UPI. The payment may take four to five working days to reflect in the system.

Once the payment is confirmed (which can take a few days), taxpayers can make the linking request.

Go to the Link Aadhaar section, enter your PAN and Aadhaar details, and validate the information.

A confirmation message stating ""Your payment details are verified."" should appear, after which users must enter their name as per Aadhaar and their mobile number.

They are also required to confirm Aadhaar validation and indicate if only the year of birth is mentioned on their Aadhaar record.

The process is completed by entering the six-digit OTP sent to the registered mobile number.

By selecting Link Aadhaar Status under Quick Links on the e-Filing homepage and entering PAN and Aadhaar details, users can view the current status. A successful linkage is indicated by a green checkmark, while pending cases will display a message stating that the request has been forwarded to UIDAI for validation.

NEW DELHI: Call it the IndiGo schedule collapse and its fallout impact. A clamour has broken out between the budget airline and Air India group over having adequate captains to avoid a repeat of what happened under the new safety-enhancing flight duty time limitation (FDTL) rules.IndiGo has had to commit to DGCA about hiring pilots — it will induct 100 in Jan itself — and AI has already come out with an ad for getting more aviators on board. But both the airlines are also facing a significant number of captain resignations — with some leaving one for the other and mostly for joining foreign carriers — so the hiring is also to ensure they don’t go below their current numbers which has made the scramble more intense that anything seen before in Indian skies.For once, their balance sheet-centric human resource departments are on the back foot and can’t oppose sprucing of ranks after what happened earlier this month. A senior official of one of the two big Indian carriers claimed its captains are already getting “calls with joining bonus of upto Rs 50 lakh.”“Where do we get captains from? Under the new FDTL, experienced pilots’ availability will become acute. There will be lot of poaching from each other,” said a senior airline official.A few years back, said a senior pilot, IndiGo had offered a joining bonus to experienced aviators to join which would take care of the bond payment, if any, needed to be paid to the airline they were resigning from. “This was in the range of Rs 15-25 lakh to take care of the bond, which back then was somewhere between Rs 5 and 15 lakh,” the pilot said.“India will witness a scramble for captains between Air India group and IndiGo. While Air India does not have a shortage as of now for its fleet except the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, it has to hire for the future. IndiGo will have to improve its pilot-management relations to retain and attract talent. Akasa does not need more pilots (it has a big surplus). Unless AI & IndiGo offer better working conditions to pilots, they will not be able to stem the flow to Middle East and other places like Vietnam,” said Captain Shakti Lumba, former VP of AI and IndiGo.IndiGo has slightly raised pilot pay from next month, by enhancing some existing and adding new allowances. Air India is planning a major salvo which will be fired in first week of Jan and is a closely guarded secret within the airline.Pilots at both AI Group and IndiGo have been unhappy for two main reasons — poor working condition and a pay structure that did not keep pace with inflation. While the FDT proposes to reduce fatigue, the tug of war means that both will have to become humane employers for pilots.While IndiGo will have less strenuous working norms for pilots that will increase its requirement, AI plans to be ready for aircraft induction that is expected from next year. As of now, only AI’s Boeing 787 fleet pilots fly more while the B777 and Airbus A320 not so much. That should change from next year and AI does not want to be in Big Blue shoes when that happens.",A clamour has broken out between the budget airline and Air India group over having adequate captains to avoid a repeat of what happened under the new safety-enhancing flight duty time limitation (FDTL) rules.

MUMBAI: Silver market globally witnessed one of the most volatile sessions in recent years on Monday as the price of the white metal fluctuated over 14% in intraday trades due to a confluence of factors. The impact was witnessed in the Indian market as well.In the international market, silver prices spurt to close to $84/ounce, while on the MCX, silver futures, after scaling a new all-time high at over Rs 2.5 lakh/kg, slipped by over Rs 22,000 (about 10%) to about Rs 2.3 lakh.While there were traders who booked profits after a jump of over 25% in a month, a decision by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) to hike margins on silver futures by 25% also weighed on its price. Hopes of a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine also softened prices, analysts and traders said. To complicate the situation further, trading volumes were thin during the holiday season. According to Kaynat Chainwala of Kotak Securities, silver's unprecedented surge this year has been driven by structural tightness, supported by multi-year supply deficits, persistent physical shortages, and strong industrial demand, particularly from solar and electric vehicles.Favourable macro conditions, including the US rate cuts, have further underpinned the rally, she said.On Monday, ""prices pulled back sharply to $74 an ounce after hitting a fresh record near $84, largely reflecting profit-taking and higher CME margin requirements, which can prompt leveraged participants to reduce exposure,"" Chainwala said.","Silver market globally witnessed one of the most volatile sessions in recent years.

Bengaluru: Axis International, controlled by Indian-origin billionaire Pankaj Oswal, has initiated an arbitration seeking at least $28.9 billion in compensation against the Republic of Guinea at the World Bank. The company has alleged unlawful revocation of its mining rights at one of the country's largest bauxite operations.The United Arab Emirates-based firm filed the claim on Dec 25 before the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID), an arm of the World Bank. Axis International has said Guinean authorities terminated its mining permit, seized equipment and froze bank accounts, despite the mine being operational.The dispute centres on a bauxite mine in western Guinea operated through Axis Minerals Resources SA, in which Axis Int'l holds an 85% stake. The company entered Guinea in 2013, secured a mining permit in 2018 and began exporting bauxite in 2020. Guinea is the world's largest exporter of bauxite."," Axis International, controlled by Indian-origin billionaire Pankaj Oswal, has initiated an arbitration seeking at least $28.9 billion in compensation against the Republic of Guinea.

Solar-led renewable energy surge

CHENNAI: The current calendar year proved to be a milestone for the Indian renewable energy sector, as annual new capacity additions to the grid hit a historic high.While final numbers are awaited in early Jan 2026, the sector has already added a whopping 44.5 GW of new capacity (including the large hydro category) during the 11-month period of 2025, led by the solar power segment.The calendar year 2024 saw an addition of about 28.7 GW of new capacity (including large hydro) to the grid.Renewable energy capacity (excluding large hydro) in 2025 has grown by 26% to 204 GW as of Nov 30, 2025. The growth recorded during the 11-month period is higher than the 21% growth achieved in the full CY 2024 (over 2023).As a result, total renewable energy capacity (excluding large hydro) has increased from 134 GW as of Dec 31, 2023, to 204 GW as of Nov 2025.India's clean energy capacity continues to be driven by solar power, which added 35 GW (across all solar segments) to the grid during the 11-month period, compared with 25 GW added in 2024.Of the total 35 GW added by the solar segment in 2025, ground-mounted capacity accounted for about 26 GW, while the rooftop solar segment contributed 7 GW. Hybrid projects added close to 1 GW, with the remaining capacity coming from off-grid solar installations.Top states in solar power installed capacity include Rajasthan (36 GW), Gujarat (25 GW), Maharashtra (17 GW), and Tamil Nadu (12 GW).During the Jan-Nov 2025 period, the wind power sector added about 6 GW of new capacity-the highest-ever addition in recent years-indicating a strong revival after a subdued phase.Thus, as of Nov 2025, India's total installed renewable energy capacity stood at 254 GW, comprising solar (133 GW), wind (54 GW), bioenergy (11 GW), small hydro (5 GW), and large hydro (50 GW, including pumped storage capacity), according to data from the union ministry of new and renewable energy.""An additional 135 GW of renewable capacity is under various stages of implementation or tendering. Tariff competitiveness remains strong, with record-low bids continuing in the range of Rs 2.44 to Rs 2.55 per kWh (approximately $29-$31 per MWh) for utility-scale solar, confirming the sustained cost advantage of clean energy technologies,"" according to IEEFA.","Renewable energy capacity (excluding large hydro) in 2025 has grown by 26% to 204 GW as of Nov 30, 2025.

‘Banks Should Organise KYC Camps’ | Mis-Selling Norms Soon

Mumbai: RBI is sharpening its focus on the fault lines that run between banks and non-bank lenders, wary that tighter linkages could amplify shocks in an uncertain global environment. Its report on banking trends makes clear that interconnectedness, particularly between banks and non-banking financial companies, has moved from a peripheral concern to a core element of financial-stability surveillance.Policymakers, the report says, remain alert to the growing role of non-banks and their increasingly complex ties with banks. As these links deepen, the RBI argues, stability will depend on ""continued vigilance through robust supervision, effective macroprudential frameworks and enhanced oversight of interconnectedness"". The emphasis is less on headline growth and more on the channels through which stress could spread.One such channel is funding dependence. NBFCs rely heavily on bank credit, creating the risk that trouble in one segment spills quickly into another. To temper this, the RBI hiked risk weights on banks' exposures to NBFCs in Nov 2023, to curb excessive concentration. Although these weights were partially rolled back for highly rated entities in Feb 2025, RBI has signalled that it will continue to monitor and manage concentration risk at the system level as part of its financial-stability toolkit.NBFCs have outpaced banks in credit expansion. NBFC credit as a share of scheduled commercial banks' credit rose to 25.3 % from 23.6 % a year ago, while their credit-to-GDP ratio increased to 14.6 %. This outperformance was broad-based, with NBFCs recording higher credit growth than banks across major segments including industry (18.3 % vs 8.2 %), services (29.8 % vs 12.0 %), and retail loans (18.1 % vs 11.7 %). However, the microfinance sector is witnessing stress. The report notes that most lenders in this segment, excluding ""other NBFCs"", recorded a contraction in credit at end-March 2025.The report also places domestic concerns in a global context. Episodes of market stress abroad have shown how liquidity strains in non-bank financial institutions can quickly intensify, driven by sudden spikes in margin and collateral calls. Such pressures, RBI warns, can transmit to banks unless policy frameworks are adapted to identify and manage leverage and liquidity risks in the non-bank sector.","RBI is wary that tighter linkages could amplify shocks in an uncertain global environment.

New age threats

MUMBAI: In a renewed push to contain fraud and improve customer safeguards, RBI has asked banks to clear the growing backlog in KYC updates and warned against the routine rejection of applications. Lapses in KYC, the central bank said, weaken defences against fraud and exclusion, particularly in rural and semi-urban areas. Alongside fraud, RBI has flagged mis-selling as a persistent conduct risk and has said that it will come out with new guidelines.In a report, RBI said banks should ""organise camps and launch intensive campaigns"" to deal with delays in periodic KYC updates, with a focus on smaller branches. It also cautioned lenders against mechanical rejections, stressing that onboarding or KYC-updation requests should not be turned down without due consideration and that reasons for rejection must be properly recorded. The regulator noted that it had itself been involved in a nationwide re-KYC drive at the gram panchayat level between July and Oct 2025.The emphasis on KYC forms part of a broader attempt to curb fraud at a time when financial crime is becoming more sophisticated.The report warned that cyber and operational incidents pose a growing threat to financial stability. To counter this, RBI said it is working closely with other authorities, including the ministry of home affairs, to develop and operationalise measures aimed at curbing digital and cyber-enabled fraud while strengthening customer protection.Technology is central to this effort. Recent initiatives include MuleHunter.ai, a system designed to identify and flag mule accounts through system-wide learning, and a digital payments intelligence platform that uses AI to detect risky transactions and share intelligence across the system.Banks have also been advised to use the mobile number revocation list available on the telecommunications department's digital intelligence platform to clean customer databases and prevent fraud carried out through voice calls and SMS. The regulator has asked lenders to tighten internal controls, ensure adequate grievance-redress officers at all levels and invest in digital financial literacy.The report said mis-selling of financial products by regulated entities has ""significant consequences"" for customers and for the financial system more broadly. In response, RBI plans to issue comprehensive instructions covering advertising, marketing and sales practices across different categories of regulated entities, with the explicit aim of preventing mis-selling.","RBI has asked banks to clear the growing backlog in KYC updates.

Why are some taxpayers getting intimations from the tax department, what is the nature of deduction and exemption claims being questioned, and what should taxpayers do? We take a look:

What is NUDGE campaign?

ITR filing & Refunds: Why are taxpayers getting ‘nudges’?

What kind of exemptions and deductions are likely under scrutiny?

What should taxpayers do if they get a ‘nudge’ from tax authorities?

Amarpal Chadha shares a checklist:

Verify Deductions and Exemptions: Check all deductions and exemptions claimed in the income-tax return and ensure adequate documentation exists to substantiate each claim

Check all deductions and exemptions claimed in the income-tax return and ensure adequate documentation exists to substantiate each claim Identify Discrepancies: Compare the return filed with Form 16, bank statements, investment proofs, and other records to spot any discrepancies.

ITR filing FY 2024-25 (AY 2025-26): The Income Tax Department is stepping up scrutiny for tax returns and income tax refund claims and many taxpayers are getting alerts to check their exemption and deduction claims. The last date to file income tax returns for FY 2024-25 was pushed to September 15, 2025 this year since the tax department took time to release forms and update the portal. However, the last date to file an updated or belated return for the current assessment year remains December 31, 2025.Several taxpayers are also facing delays in their returns and refunds being processed. Ahead of the important deadline, the Income Tax Department has issued a clarification on why some taxpayers are getting alerts to review their ITRs.The Income Tax Department has said that in the ongoing financial year 2025–26, over 21 lakh taxpayers have already updated their ITRs for AYs 2021–22 to 2024–25 and paid more than ₹2,500 crore in taxes. Also, over 15 lakh ITRs have been revised for the current assessment year.In a press release, the Income Tax Department has said that some taxpayers have claimed ‘ineligible’ refunds - through the deductions and exemptions route.This has led to their income being underreported.“Under the risk management framework, and through the use of advanced data analytics, cases for Assessment Year (AY) 2025–26 have been identified,” the Income Tax Department said.The tax department on its part is ‘nudging’ taxpayers to update their tax returns in case there is some discrepancy in the deductions and exemptions.Identified taxpayers are being sent SMS and email under the government’s “Non-intrusive Usage of Data to Guide and Enable (NUDGE)” campaign. The aim is to encourage these taxpayers to correct errors in tax return filing, ahead of the December 31, 2025 deadline.“This initiative reflects a trust-first approach to tax administration, under which taxpayers are provided an opportunity to review their Income-tax Returns (ITRs) and voluntarily correct any ineligible claims, wherever required,” the tax department said.“The campaign leverages data analytics and technology to enable a transparent, non-intrusive, and taxpayer-centric compliance environment, with an emphasis on guidance and voluntary compliance,” the department adds.The tax department has advised the concerned taxpayers to “review their ITRs, verify the correctness of their deduction and exemption claims, and revise their returns, if required, within the prescribed time by 31 December 2025, so as to avoid further enquiries in the matter.”Amarpal Chadha, Tax Partner at EY India explains that the NUDGE campaign is an initiative of the Income Tax Department aimed at encouraging taxpayers to voluntarily review deduction or exemption claims that have been identified as potentially ineligible through data analytics.The Department is also leveraging global information-exchange frameworks such as the Automatic Exchange of Information (AEOI), Common Reporting Standards (CRS), and the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) to identify possible discrepancies in foreign asset reporting, Chadha told TOI.Under the tax department’s initiative, taxpayers may receive an email or SMS explaining the reason for the communication and advising them to verify the accuracy of deductions or exemptions claimed, as well as the correctness of foreign asset disclosures. Where a taxpayer believes that corrective action is required, a revised return may be filed on or before December 31, 2025, which is the deadline for filing updated income tax returns for FY 2024-25Tanu Gupta, Partner, Mainstay Tax Advisors LLP has a clear message: In principle, all those exemptions and deductions which are not genuine are likely to come under scrutiny.“Even those deductions and exemptions which are inconsistent with the income tax department's records/information/data, may also come under scrutiny. The most sought-after deduction/exemption currently includes ""Donation to Political Parties"", ""House Rent Allowance"" to name a few,” she told TOI.According to Amarpal Chadha, any deduction that is claimed for donations to political parties where an incorrect or invalid PAN of the donee has been provided may come under the Income Tax Department’s scrutiny.The tax department has said that there are also cases where the taxpayers have given incorrect or invalid PAN details. Other cases pertain to the extent of deductions and exemptions that are being claimed by the taxpayers.“In addition, any deduction or exemption claimed in the income-tax return over and above what is reflected in Form 16 such as HRA exemption, exemptions under the Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (DTAA), gratuity exemption etc. are also under tax department’s radar,” he told TOI.Tanu Gupta recommends that for all the claims including exemptions and deductions, the taxpayer should always keep in handy the following documents: receipts / invoices of the payments for which exemption / deduction is claimed, bank statement evidencing such payment through proper banking channels, receipts from the recipient to corroborate with such payments.These are broad guidelines for the documents which the taxpayer should anyway keep on files for a good financial housekeeping, she says.Is there a need for panic? No, says Tanu Gupta. “Instead, the taxpayer needs to revisit their claims of exemptions and deductions in the return and take action accordingly viz file the revised return if needed. As the name suggests, the abbreviation and the complete name of it (Non-Intrusive Usage of Data to Guide and Enable), it is to facilitate the taxpayer to file compliant tax returns voluntarily, with correct, justified and genuine claims of deductions/exemptions,” she tells TOI.“There are cases where the taxpayers have received the communication from the department, although they believe that they do not have any inconsistency for the claims made in the return. They only need to see if they have all supporting documents for such payments to submit to the tax authorities when asked for,” explains Tanu Gupta, adding that wherever such exemptions / deductions are not authentic, the taxpayer needs to immediately revise the tax return by reversing such claims in the returns; and pay due income tax along with interest.If any claim or reporting needs correction, file a revised return within the prescribed timeline currently on or before December 31, 2025, he says.“However, if the taxpayer believes that the exemptions or deductions claimed are accurate and valid, they may wait for further communication from the Income Tax Department,” he adds.It is important to restate here that taxpayers do not have to worry where their tax claims are genuine.The Income Tax Department has clarified that taxpayers whose claims are genuine and correctly made in accordance with law are not required to take any further action.“It is clarified that taxpayers who do not avail of this opportunity may still file an updated return from 1 January 2026, as permitted under law, subject to payment of additional tax liability,” it has said.","Identified taxpayers are being sent SMS and email under the government’s ‘Non- intrusive Usage of Data to Guide and Enable (NUDGE)’ campaign. The aim is to encourage these taxpayers to correct errors in tax return filing, ahead of the December 31, 2025 deadline.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126159165,imgsize-48186,width-400,resizemode-4/income-tax-return.jpg"

The United States remains the top debtor of Taiwan banks for the 41st straight quarter. This means the U.S. owes more money to Taiwanese banks than any other country. According to a report by Focus Taiwan, this trend has continued for more than ten years without any change at the top spot.Citing data released by the central bank, the report shows that the money Taiwanese banks have tied up in the US grew by $4.03 billion. This is an increase of 2.07% from the end of June. By the end of September, the total amount reached $198.896 billion. The report noted that Hsieh Jen-chun, who is the deputy head of the central bank's Department of Financial Inspection, said the growth happened because banks put more money into U.S. securities and lending.On the other hand, Luxembourg is now the second-largest debtor to Taiwan's banks. It took the second spot away from China. Exposure to Luxembourg rose by $2.72 billion to reach $50.77 billion at the end of September. Hsieh said the increase happened because Taiwanese banks put more funds into trust assets in that European country. This is the third quarter in a row that the money kept in Luxembourg has grown.China fell to the third spot on the list. Even though the money tied up in China rose by about $1.07 billion to reach $49.56 billion, it is now less than Luxembourg. Hsieh noted that exposure to China stays between $40 billion and $50 billion. He said that this is due to ""concerns about that country's economic outlook."" He also mentioned that there is ""caution over Taiwan's Financial Supervisory Commission restrictions on lending and investments in China. ""Total international claims by Taiwanese banks also went up. These claims include things like loans, investments, and deposits. They rose by 3.48% from the previous quarter to reach $670.8 billion. This growth comes from more lending to the global nonbank private sector.Australia is the fourth-largest debtor with $42.14 billion. Other major nations on the list are Japan, Hong Kong, the United Kingdom, Singapore, France, and Vietnam. The top 10 debtor nations together account for $496.0 billion.

Japan's Nikkei was down over 200 points to 50,550. Shanghai and Shenzhen added 0.4% and 0.19%, respectively. In Korea, Kospi gained 1.6%, to reach 4,197 at 8:40 AM IST.With only a handful of trading sessions left in the year, sentiment has been supported by expectations that US interest rates could be cut further, alongside confidence that the rally led by technology stocks has not yet run out of steam. Earlier this month, the Federal Reserve reduced borrowing costs as widely anticipated. However, it also struck a more measured tone, suggesting rates could remain unchanged at its next meeting, after two policymakers opposed a cut and one pushed for a deeper reduction.On the commodities front, gold and silver pulled back after surging to record levels in recent days. Both metals have benefited from strong buying interest, fuelled by expectations that lower interest rates would enhance their appeal, as well as their traditional role as safe-haven assets during times of uncertainty. Geopolitical tensions, including US strikes in Nigeria and a blockade involving Venezuelan oil tankers, have further added to their attractiveness.Gold was hovering near $4,500 on Monday, after topping out just under $4,550 late last week. Silver slipped to $77.50, having briefly touched a record $80. The metal’s sharp rise has also been underpinned by tightening supply and rising industrial demand.Oil prices recovered some ground after falling more than two percent on Friday, as markets assessed developments from weekend talks between US President Donald Trump and Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky on possible peace proposals.Trump said on Sunday that an agreement to end Russia’s invasion of Ukraine was closer than ever, though he acknowledged there had been no clear breakthrough on territorial questions. He added that it would become evident within weeks whether the nearly four-year-long conflict, which has claimed tens of thousands of lives, could be brought to an end.","Asian markets mostly traded in green on Monday, beginning the week on a positive note.

China's BYD poised to overtake Tesla in 2025 EV sales,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/chinas-byd-poised-to-overtake-tesla-in-2025-ev-sales/articleshow/126222415.cms,"Growing Chinese auto giant BYD stands poised to officially surpass Tesla as the world's biggest electric vehicle company in annual sales.The two groups are expected soon to publish their final figures for 2025, and based on sales data so far this year, there is almost no chance the American company led by Elon Musk will retain its leadership position.At the end of November, Shenzhen-based BYD, which also produces hybrid vehicles, had sold 2.07 million EVs so far in 2025.Tesla, for its part, had sold 1.22 million by the end of September.Tesla's September figures included a one-time boost in sales, to nearly half-a-million vehicles in a three-month period, before the expiration of a US tax credit for buyers of electric vehicles -- which ended under legislation backed by President Donald Trump, a climate change skeptic.But Tesla's sales in the coming quarter are expected to fall to 449,000, according to a FactSet analysis consensus. That would give Tesla about 1.65 million sales for all of 2025, a drop of 7.7 percent and well below the level BYD had attained by end November.Deutsche Bank, which projects just 405,000 Tesla EV sales during the fourth quarter, sees the company's sales down by around one-third in both North America and Europe, and by one-tenth in China.- Transition period -Industry watchers say it will take time for EV demand to reach a level of equilibrium in the United States following the elimination of the $7,500 US tax credit at the end of September 2025.Even prior to that, Tesla had seen sales struggle in key markets over CEO Musk's political support of Trump and other far-right politicians. Tesla has also faced rising EV competition from BYD and other Chinese companies and from European giants.""We believe Tesla will see some weakness on deliveries"" in the fourth quarter, said Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities.Sales of 420,000 would be ""good enough to show stable demand,"" with Wall Street ""laser focused on the autonomous chapter kicking off in 2026,"" Ives added, referring to plans for self-driving vehicles.Even as it has grown quickly, BYD has faced challenges in its home market.With profitability in China weighed down by price-wary consumers, the company has sought to strengthen its foothold in foreign markets.BYD is ""one of the pioneers to establish overseas production capacity and supply chains for EVs,"" Jing Yang, Director of Asia-Pacific Corporate Ratings at Fitch Ratings, told AFP.""Going forward, its geographical diversification is likely to help it to navigate an increasingly complicated global tariff environment,"" said Yang.Overseas rivals to BYD have balked at Chinese state subsidies and other state supports that have allowed the company to sell vehicles cheaply.Trump's predecessor Joe Biden imposed 100 percent tariffs on Chinese EV imports that could potentially go even higher under Trump. Europe has also imposed tariffs on Chinese imports, but BYD is building manufacturing capacity in Hungary.While the chance of Tesla reclaiming its global leadership in EVs looks uncertain, the American company is also potentially positioned for growth.Michaeli of TD Cowen sees autonomous technology playing an increasingly important role for Tesla, with breakthroughs in its ""full self-driving"" or ""FSD"" offerings potentially boosting sales.""As Tesla really begins to roll out eyes-off features and expand FSDs capability, if they do that successfully, that should generate more demand for their vehicles,"" Michaeli said.Musk has said the Cybercab, an autonomous robotaxi model, will begin production in April 2026. The company has also unveiled lower-priced versions of the Models 3 and Y that could boost sales.","Chinese auto giant BYD stands poised to officially surpass Tesla as the world's biggest electric vehicle company.

'Substantial' gains

Stability needed

SOFIA: Bulgaria will become the 21st country to adopt the euro on Thursday, but some believe the move could bring higher prices and add to instability in the European Union's poorest country.A protest campaign emerged this year to ""keep the Bulgarian lev"", playing on public fears of price rises and a generally negative view of the euro among much of the population.But successive governments have pushed to join the eurozone and supporters insist it will boost the economy, reinforce ties to the West and protect against Russia's influence.The single currency first rolled out in 12 countries on January 1, 2002, and has since regularly extended its influence, with Croatia the last country to join in 2023.But Bulgaria faces unique challenges, including anti-corruption protests that recently swept a conservative-led government from office, leaving the country on the verge of its eighth election in five years.Boryana Dimitrova of the Alpha Research polling institute, which has tracked public opinion on the euro for a year, told AFP any problems with euro adoption would be seized on by anti-EU politicians.Any issues will become ""part of the political campaign, which creates a basis for rhetoric directed against the EU"", she said.While far-right and pro-Russia parties have been behind several anti-euro protests, many people, especially in poor rural areas, worry about the new currency.""Prices will go up. That's what friends of mine who live in Western Europe told me,"" Bilyana Nikolova, 53, who runs a grocery store in the village of Chuprene in northwestern Bulgaria, told AFP.The latest survey by the EU's polling agency Eurobarometer suggested 49 percent of Bulgarians were against the single currency.After hyperinflation in the 1990s, Bulgaria pegged its currency to the German mark and then to the euro, making the country dependent on the European Central Bank (ECB).""It will now finally be able to take part in decision making within this monetary union,"" Georgi Angelov, senior economist at the Open Society Institute in Sofia, told AFP.An EU member since 2007, Bulgaria joined the so-called ""waiting room"" to the single currency in 2020, at the same time as Croatia.The gains of joining the euro are ""substantial"", ECB president Christine Lagarde said last month in Sofia, citing ""smoother trade, lower financing costs and more stable prices"".Small and medium-sized enterprises stand to save an equivalent of some 500 million euros ($580 million) in exchange fees, she added.One sector expected to benefit in the Black Sea nation is tourism, which this year generated around eight percent of the country's GDP.Lagarde predicted the impact on consumer prices would be ""modest and short-lived"", saying in earlier euro changeovers, the impact was between 0.2 and 0.4 percentage points.But consumers -- already struggling with inflation -- fear they will not be able to make ends meet, according to Dimitrova.Food prices in November were up five percent year-on-year, according to the National Statistical Institute, more than double the eurozone average.Parliament this year adopted empowered oversight bodies to investigate sharp price hikes and curb ""unjustified"" surges linked to the euro changeover.But analysts fear wider political uncertainty risks delaying much needed anti-corruption reforms, which could have a knock-on effect on the wider economy.""The challenge will be to have a stable government for at least one to two years, so we can fully reap the benefits of joining the euro area,"" Angelov said.","Bulgaria will become the 21st country to adopt the euro on Thursday.

China's industrial firms saw their profits drop by 13.1 per cent in November, from last year, marking the steepest decline in over a year. This fall came despite strong exports, putting focus on country's ongoing economic struggles and increasing pressure for more government support. The National Bureau of Statistics released these figures on Saturday, as quoted by Reuters.The decline was worse than October's 5.5 per cent. This trend comes as China faces persistent factory-gate deflation and weak consumer spending. For the first 11 months of the year, industrial profits barely grew, showing just a 0.1% increase compared to the previous year's 1.9% growth.""The profit numbers show a broader cooling in economic activity in the fourth quarter, mainly due to the drag from soft domestic demand,"" said Xu Tianchen, senior economist at the Economist Intelligence Unit. However, Xu remained cautiously optimistic about future profits, suggesting companies might find more opportunities overseas.Despite this, there were some industries that managed to register gains. The automobile industry posted a 7.5 per cent rise in profitability, while the high tech industry posted a 10 per cent rise. A massive decline of 47.3 percent in profitability was seen in the coal mine industry.An estimate by the think tank, Rhodium Group, quoted by Reuters, indicated a growth of 2.5 per cent to 3 per cent in the Chinese economy for the year, which is approximately half the officially-hinted growth.Chinese policymakers are now promising more support. At a recent meeting, they pledged to maintain ""proactive"" fiscal policies next year. The government has also committed to improving employment, boosting consumption, stabilizing prices, and helping the struggling property market.NBS Chief Statistician Yu Weining noted that industrial firms still need stronger support, especially given the uncertain global environment and ongoing changes in growth drivers. The data covers companies earning at least 20 million yuan ($2.85 million) in annual revenue from their main operations.","China's industrial firms saw their profits drop by 13.1 per cent in November, from last year, marking the steepest decline in over a year.

Silver price jumped nearly 9% to trade at a record high of $78.65, on Friday (local time) according to the New York Commodity Exchange. With this surge, the white metal has outpaced gold this year, with prices up more than 158% over the past 12 months.The rally extended across the broader metals market. Spot gold climbed to an all-time high of $4,549.71 an ounce, while platinum touched a record $2,454.12 after gaining around 10%, according to Reuters. Spot palladium also recorded the sharpest move of the session, rising more than 14% to $1,924.03 an ounce.Gold, meanwhile, edged up just over 1.2% to reach a high of $4,562.70.Silver rose on the back of tight supply, rising industrial demand and expectations of more rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. Analysts have also pointed to a mix of lower interest rates, growing use of silver in AI data centres, supply constraints and uncertainty around tariffs as key drivers behind the white metal’s surge this year.“Prospect of lower US interest rates is still supporting demand for gold and silver, lifting both metals to new record highs,” UBS analyst Giovanni Staunovo told Reuters. In early trading, silver crossed the $75-per-ounce level for the first time, as both precious and industrial metals rallied amid economic and political uncertainty.Gold is on course for its strongest annual performance since 1979, supported by Federal Reserve policy easing, geopolitical risks, central bank buying, higher ETF holdings and ongoing de-dollarisation. Silver has benefited from structural supply deficits, its designation as a US critical mineral and strong industrial demand, far outpacing gold’s nearly 72% rise.Platinum and palladium, widely used in automotive catalytic converters, have also advanced sharply amid tight supply conditions, tariff uncertainty and a shift in investment demand away from gold. Platinum has gained about 165% this year, while palladium is up more than 90% year to date.“Momentum-driven and speculative players have been powering the rally in gold and silver since early December, with thin year-end liquidity, expectations of prolonged US rate cuts, a weaker dollar and a flare-up in geopolitical risks combining to push precious metals to fresh record highs,” Kelvin Wong, senior market analyst at OANDA, told Reuters.“Looking ahead into the first half of 2026, gold could move towards the $5,000 level, while silver has the potential to reach around $90,” Wong further said.Traders are currently pricing in two US rate cuts next year, a support that continues to lift non-yielding assets such as gold and silver. At the same time, market sentiment has also been influenced by geopolitical developments, including US moves related to Venezuelan oil and strikes against Islamic State militants in northwest Nigeria following attacks on Christian communities.","Silver price jumped nearly 9% to trade at a record high of $78.65, on Friday (local time) With this surge, the white metal has outpaced gold this year, with prices up more than 158% over the past 12 months.

2026 — The year of tariff consequences

The year 2025, reshaped global commerce in ways not seen for decades, moving into another uncertain phase, as pressures on growth and stability are expected to intensify. So will 2026 be another turbulent patch for global trade?Global merchandise trade managed to stay resilient through 2025, even as US President Donald Trump pushed ahead with higher tariffs that effectively raised barriers around the world’s largest economy. According to data cited by shipping industry veteran John McCown, global container volumes increased 2.1% in October compared with the same month last year, according to Bloomberg.Overall figures, however, revealed sharp regional divergences.While inbound container volumes into the US fell by 8%, imports into Africa, the Middle East, Latin America and India recorded strong growth, pointing to a rebalancing of global trade flows.“World container supply chains have already begun to adapt and reconfigure trading patterns,” McCown wrote in a research note cited by Bloomberg. He compared the current slowdown with last year’s rally, noting that after a 15.2% rise in US container imports in 2024, “to say that the annual total for 2025 will be in diametric contrast is an understatement.”McCown attributed much of this shift to Trump’s trade policies.In a LinkedIn post, he argued that if 2025 marked the peak of tariff announcements, the impact would be felt more fully in the year ahead. He wrote that if 2025 was the year of the tariff, 2026 will be the year of tariff consequences.Trade analysts said that several fault lines are already visible as 2026 draws closer. One of the most closely watched developments will be the review of the United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement, the North American trade pact that came into force in 2020. The agreement is due for reassessment just six years after implementation, an unusually short timeframe for such a deal.US trade representative Jamieson Greer told lawmakers this month that the process has drawn heavy engagement, with more than 1,500 responses submitted during the public consultation. “Many stakeholders expressed support for the USMCA and many explicitly called for the agreement to be extended,” Greer said, as quoted by Bloomberg.“At the same time, virtually all stakeholders also called for some sort of improvement to the agreement.” Any attempt to revise the deal is expected to be contentious, as gains for one member could come at the expense of another. Industries in both Canada and Mexico are already under pressure from US import duties, while diplomatic relations remain strained. Tensions worsened in October after Trump halted trade talks with Canada in response to anti-tariff advertisements featuring Ronald Reagan.At the same time, global shipping faces the prospect of fresh disruption. Industry experts warn that two developments, both seemingly positive, could strain supply chains.The first is a possible large-scale return of cargo vessels to the Red Sea, after shipping lines were diverted around southern Africa for nearly two years due to Houthi attacks. With hostilities easing since the Gaza peace plan took effect in October, the route has become safer. French carriers CMA CGM SA and Denmark’s A.P. Moller-Maersk A/S have already resumed limited transits through the area.But a full return to the Red Sea and the Suez Canal could overwhelm existing infrastructure. Lars Jensen, chief executive of consultancy Vespucci Maritime, warned during a Flexport webinar in November that it would “flood the market with a lot more capacity” and lead to “massive port congestion issues in Europe.”A second risk could emerge from stronger demand. Jensen said that if the US economy accelerates in 2026 as Trump administration officials predict, driven by lower interest rates and increased investment, a wave of inventory restocking could exceed the shipping sector’s ability.Uncertainty also surrounds the durability of the Trump administration’s recent trade agreements. While the White House has highlighted deals struck with several major economies in 2025, these arrangements lack the enforcement mechanisms typical of traditional trade pacts. Most include only short-term commitments, and the truce with China extends for just one year, leaving unresolved the US’s most imbalanced trading relationship.Concerns that these agreements could unravel have been reinforced by recent events. Indonesia has resisted US trade demands since Washington announced what it called a “landmark trade deal” in July, fearing constraints on its independence, with a revised agreement now expected in late January. China has raised objections with Malaysia and Cambodia over their trade deals with the US, warning against actions that undermine Beijing’s interests. The UK has also encountered fresh complications, Bloomberg reported.Greer said last week that difficult negotiations with the European Union and India are likely to continue into the new year. His office also warned of possible retaliation against the EU, citing what Washington views as excessive regulation of American technology firms.Adding to the uncertainty is a pending US Supreme Court decision on the legality of Trump’s reciprocal tariffs, the sweeping duties imposed on most major trading partners. A ruling against the administration could raise questions over whether importers would be refunded tariffs already paid.Kevin Hassett, director of the National Economic Council, told CBS’s Face the Nation that even in such a scenario, refunds were unlikely. It would be “pretty unlikely that they’re going to call for widespread refunds, because it would be an administrative problem,” he said.Betting markets currently assign roughly a 75% probability to Trump losing the case, a result that could push the administration to rely on alternative legal powers to maintain tariffs.","Global merchandise trade managed to stay resilient through 2025, even as US President Donald Trump pushed ahead with higher tariffs.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

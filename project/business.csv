'We'll no longer tolerate': Donald Trump signs executive order giving drugmakers 30 days to slash drug prices,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/well-no-longer-tolerate-donald-trump-signs-executive-order-giving-drugmakers-30-days-to-slash-drug-costs/articleshow/121117011.cms,"President Donald Trump on Monday signed a sweeping executive order aimed at slashing prescription drug prices in the United States, giving pharmaceutical companies a 30-day deadline to cut costs or face action.""Starting today, the United States will no longer subsidise the healthcare of foreign countries... and we’ll no longer tolerate profiteering and price gouging from Big Pharma,"" Trump told reporters as he signed the executive order at the White House that drug prices should fall by at least 59 percent -- and in some cases as high as 80 or 90 percent.The directive instructs the health department, under Robert F Kennedy Jr.'s leadership, to negotiate new drug prices within a month. Should negotiations fail, Kennedy must create a rule linking US medication prices to lower international rates.Trump further stated, ""We're going to equalize. We're all going to pay the same. We're going to pay what Europe pays.""The impact of the Republican president’s executive order on Americans with private health insurance is still unclear. The government mainly has the power to control drug prices through Medicare and Medicaid programs.The announcement of potential drug price reductions coincided with House Republicans unveiling their proposal to reduce Medicaid funding by $880 billion.The proposed ""Most Favoured Nation"" policy seeks to align US drug prices with the lowest international rates for identical medications. ""Whoever is paying the lowest price, that's the price that we're going to get,"" Trump said.The implementation largely depends on pharmaceutical companies' willingness to negotiate prices and might face legal opposition, similar to Trump's previous attempt during his first administration.Trump criticised the current pricing system, highlighting disparities in costs between the US and Europe, particularly regarding the obesity medication Ozempic.""It was really the countries that forced Big Pharma to do things that, frankly, I'm not sure they really felt comfortable doing, but they've gotten away with it,"" Trump said.He announced plans to investigate nations allegedly pressuring pharmaceutical companies through product restrictions to secure lower prices. He acknowledged challenging ""the most powerful lobby in the world -- the drug and pharmaceutical lobby.""Earlier on Monday, Trump previewed the reduction: ""DRUG PRICES TO BE CUT BY 59%, PLUS! Gasoline, Energy, Groceries, and all other costs, DOWN. NO INFLATION!!!"" he wrote on Truth Social.Trump said that lower prescription drug prices in the US would be offset by higher costs in other countries.This isn’t his first attempt to lower drug prices. During his 2017–2021 term, he proposed similar measures, but they were blocked by strong resistance from the pharmaceutical industry.","President Donald Trump on Monday signed a sweeping executive order aimed at slashing prescription drug prices in the United States.

The closure resulted in the cancellation of more than 500 flights by airlines, with many carriers offering passengers the option of complete refunds or flight rescheduling.The following airports were affected by the NOTAM, but have now been opened:The Srinagar International Airport has been cleared for operations, an official confirmed on Monday.

The directives also specify that airport surveillance cameras must remain functional at all times, and security staff deployment aboard flights shall occur through priority-based and random selection processes.The CISF has temporarily taken charge of additional security responsibilities at 69 civil airports across the country, including cargo operations and in-line hold baggage screening system supervision, as part of its counter-terrorism measures. This extension of duties follows a BCAS directive issued on May 9, prompted by the Pahalgam terrorist incident and the nation's current security situation, according to a CISF spokesperson.The temporary security arrangement will remain effective until May 18, as confirmed by the spokesperson to PTI.Previously, the CISF's role was limited to passenger frisking and cabin baggage inspection, whilst private security personnel hired by airlines and airport operators managed cargo screening and In-line Hold Baggage Screening System (ILHBSS) operations.","The government has decided to lift the Notices to Airmen (NOTAMs) for several airports across north and north-western India.

Income tax department notifies all 7 ITR forms for AY 2025-26; Check key changes in capital gains reporting and disclosure norms,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/taxation/income-tax-department-notifies-all-7-itr-forms-for-ay-2025-26-check-key-changes-in-capital-gains-reporting-and-disclosure-norms/articleshow/121117524.cms,"Income tax department has notified all seven Income Tax Return (ITR) forms for the assessment year 2025-26. While ITR Forms 1 and 4, used by small and medium taxpayers, were notified on April 29, ITR-7, applicable for trusts and charitable institutions, was notified on May 11.One important change has been introduced in ITR-1 and ITR-4, notified on April 29, relating to the reporting of capital gains income from listed equities, as reported by news agency PTI.Now, salaried individuals and those under the presumptive taxation scheme, having long-term capital gains (LTCG) of up to Rs 1.25 lakh in a financial year, will be able to file ITR-1 and ITR-4, respectively. Earlier, such persons/entities were required to file ITR-2.Under the Income Tax law, LTCG of up to Rs 1.25 lakh from the sale of listed shares and mutual funds is exempt from tax. Gains exceeding Rs 1.25 lakh per annum are subject to 12.5 per cent tax.The last date for filing ITR for individuals and those who do not have to get their accounts audited is July 31.One change which has been introduced in ITR forms 2, 3, 5, 6 and 7 pertains to rationalisation of capital gains tax. In Schedule Capital Gains of the ITR, capital gains must now be split based on whether they arose before or after July 23, 2024.In the Budget presented on July 24, 2024, the government had proposed to lower long-term capital gains tax on real estate to 12.5 per cent without indexation benefit, from 20 per cent with indexation.Indexation benefit allows taxpayers to arrive at the cost price of the property after adjusting for inflation.With this, individuals or HUFs who purchased houses before July 23, 2024, can opt to pay Long Term Capital Gain (LTCG) tax under the new scheme at the rate of 12.5 per cent without indexation or claim the indexation benefit and pay 20 per cent tax.Also, in ITR-3, which is filed by individuals and HUFs having income from profits and gains of business or profession, the threshold for reporting assets and liabilities under 'Schedule AL' has been raised from Rs 50 lakh to Rs 1 crore, thus reducing the disclosure burden on middle-income taxpayers.ITR Form 1 (Sahaj) and ITR Form 4 (Sugam) are simpler forms that cater to a large number of small and medium taxpayers.Sahaj can be filed by a resident individual having annual income of up to Rs 50 lakh and who receives income from salary, one house property, other sources (interest), and agricultural income up to Rs 5,000 a year.Sugam can be filed by individuals, Hindu Undivided Families (HUFs), and firms (other than Limited Liability Partnerships (LLPs)) having a total annual income of up to Rs 50 lakh and income from business and profession.ITR-2 is filed by individuals and HUFs not having income from profits and gains in business or profession, but having income from capital gains.ITR-5 is filed by firms, Limited Liability Partnerships, and Cooperative Societies. ITR-6 is filed by companies registered under the Companies Act. ITR-7 is filed by trusts and charitable institutions.","ITR Forms 1 and 4, used by small and medium taxpayers, were notified on April 29. ITR-7, applicable for trusts and charitable institutions, was notified on May 11. The last date for filing ITR for individuals and those who do not have to get their accounts audited is July 31.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121117572,imgsize-339145,width-400,resizemode-4/121117572.jpg"

Tata Steel owns the UK and Netherlands businesses through T Steel Holdings.Any overseas investment exceeding $1 billion in a financial year requires prior approval from the RBI. The board approved the investment proposal on Monday. Since T Steel Holdings is 100% owned by Tata Steel, there will be no change in the Singapore company's shareholding after the capital infusion. This move comes after Tata Steel converted $565 million (Rs 4,822 crore) loans given to T Steel into equity in FY25.The Indian company's UK and Netherlands units are undergoing a transformation triggered by regulatory changes that are driving decarbonisation in Europe. This involves closing legacy assets and replacing them with new production routes centred around electric arc furnaces Future cash flows will depend on the impact of evolving regulations on carbon border adjustment (CBA is Europe and UK's way to set a fair price on carbon emissions while producing carbon-intensive goods. It charges this price when goods are imported into its territory, providing a level playing field to local producers who face similar carbon costs), availability/pricing of clean raw materials, and assumptions around costs of and market premium for green steel, the Indian company said.","Tata Steel will inject $2.5 billion (Rs 21,411 crore) into its Singapore unit T Steel Holdings.

JP Morgan is underweight on Dr Reddy’s Laboratories with the target price at Rs 1,060. Analysts said the pharma major’s Jan-March revenue was in line, but EBITDA missed estimates. According to them the underweight rating is premised on weak core EBITDA margins, lacklustre growth in India, lack of visibility on niche launches in the US and Semaglutide opportunity can be decent but the market is expected to be competitive. Citigroup has a buy rating on Biocon with the target price at Rs 430. Analysts said Biocon’s Jan-March numbers were weak as ex-gRevlimid EBITDA margin declined. The company also reported about 4% annual growth in biosimilars despite a strong market share expansion in onco assets that indicates a weak pricing scenario. Nomura has given a ‘buy’ rating on Zydus Life with the target price at Rs 1,140. Analysts said the company has received approval for gCopaxone, which they estimate has a market size of $600 million. Besides Teva, there are two generic players for the same. They also expect additional competition in future from Biocon and Dr Reddy’s. Macquarie maintained its underperform rating on Swiggy with the target price at Rs 260. Calling the Jan-March numbers ‘from bad to worse’, they said Swiggy’s results continued to under-score the challenges for the platform. The management now expects contribution margin break even in 3-5 quarters versus prior guidance of achieving the same by December 2025.They also pointed out that the margin gap to Eternal (Zomato) continued to narrow. Goldman Sachs has a buy rating on Pidilite with the target price at Rs 3,475. Analysts said the company's strong, near-double digit volume growth continued despite a muted environment.

NEW DELHI: The US-China trade deal has increased the headache for Indian negotiators, who are once again headed to Washington DC to discuss the proposed bilateral trade deal.While signalling movement towards a deal between the world's two largest trading nations, the 90-day truce, which will see them slash tariffs by 115 percentage points, opens the door for the flow of goods from China. As a result, some of the interest in Indian products is bound to come down as supply lines will reopen for 90 days, apart from some front-loading of consignments in case the pause is not extended.India will, however, retain an edge over some others in the region, including Vietnam, which faces higher ""reciprocal tariffs"". But the rush to quickly recalibrate, if not relocate, some production out of China will slow down.The announcement also mounts pressure on New Delhi to seal a deal as early as possible given that the 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs for countries, other than China, is due to end on July 9. Already, the UK has agreed to the terms of a deal with the US, and others such as South Korea and Israel, along with several others, are in talks.Indian govt officials are hoping for an ""early deal"" but would obviously want New Delhi's interests to be taken on board amid enormous pressure from the Trump administration to push ahead with its demands, be it lowering tariffs on automobiles, whiskey, or farm products, a key ask from the US side.","The US-China trade deal has increased the headache for Indian negotiators.

RBI dividend to inject fresh liquidity,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/rbi-dividend-to-inject-fresh-liquidity/articleshow/121124637.cms,"RBI

MUMBAI: Surplus liquidity in the banking system could reach Rs 6 lakh crore, with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) expected to transfer a hefty dividend to the govt. Estimates for this dividend range between Rs 2.25 lakh crore and Rs 2.75 lakh crore. This payout, a significant boost to the Centre's coffers, is expected to inject fresh liquidity into the banking system, raising surplus funds to between Rs 5.5 lakh crore and Rs 6 lakh crore.The RBI's earnings this year were strong, partly due to income from deploying its large foreign exchange reserves in high-yielding US govt bonds and from selling dollars to stabilise the rupee. It also made gains from domestic bond holdings, which rose by Rs 1.95 lakh crore in FY25. The RBI's active dollar sales to stabilise the rupee also contributed to its earnings. Gross dollar sales reached $371.6 billion in FY25 till Feb, up sharply from $153 billion the previous year. Foreign exchange reserves peaked at $704 billion in Sept 2024, with RBI estimated to have sold over $125 billion since then.The sharp rise in liquidity could put downward pressure on short-term interest rates . ""With the announcement of the RBI dividend this month, we expect banking liquidity to be approximately Rs 6 trillion,"" said a note from Axis Mutual Fund.""Such high banking liquidity could lead to a rally at the short end of the curve."" Barclays also expects the surplus to expand further as the dividend reaches the system. ""We anticipate system liquidity to improve further to Rs 5.5-6 trillion by end-May,"" its analysts wrote. ""This is likely to drag down the weighted average call rate (WACR) closer to the standing deposit facility (SDF) rate of 5.75%, amounting to effective easing. ""The surge in liquidity could prompt the RBI's monetary policy committee (MPC) to stay on hold at its June meeting, with policymakers likely to wait for clearer signals on inflation and growth. The RBI distributes dividends after setting aside funds for contingency provisioning. The amount of funds set aside for provisions depends on the size of the RBI balance sheet. Given the dip in the reserves, contingency provisioning is expected to remain slightly more than last year's Rs 42,800 crore. The dividend amount is determined under the Economic Capital Framework, which stipulates a risk buffer of 5.5% to 6.5% of the RBI's balance sheet.",The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) expected to transfer a hefty dividend to the govt.

India-UK trade deal: Why the new FTA in the series of bilateral FTAs is a joint success of trade & foreign policy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/india-uk-trade-deal-why-the-new-fta-in-the-series-of-bilateral-ftas-is-a-joint-success-of-trade-foreign-policy/articleshow/121056370.cms,"India-UK FTA: It’s the joint success story of India’s Trade & Foreign Policy.

The recent announcement of India UK FTA is new in the series of bilateral FTAs negotiated in the recent past – starting with Australia, followed by UAE and EFTA countries (Norway, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Iceland). It demonstrates a very deliberate and sure-footed approach of expanding India’s FTA footprint for gaining market access for goods of Indian origin and opening new avenues of growth and international cooperation. It’s the joint success story of India’s Trade & Foreign Policy Successful negotiation of the FTA with the UK – till most recently being part of the EU, also bodes well for the progress that India will be able to make with EU FTA negotiations which have been waiting for a decisive push after the past thirteen years of negotiations.India EU FTA has been held back on issues like unconditional market access to European luxury car manufacturers at concessional rate of duty, better access to alco-beverage sector and need for data secure status for India.As is evident from the PIB press release issued on May 6, some of the long standing, contentious issues, which have been holding back the India EU negotiations have been successfully addressed in the India UK FTA.Illustratively progressive reduction in duty rates on import of completely built-up cars from the UK over a period of ten years, subject to the upper limit on the number of cars that can be imported in a year.This quota-based access to luxury or fully built up cars under the FTA is a unique solution which balances out the opposite policy pull of granting market access but without adversely impacting the domestic industry. Simultaneous reduction in duty on cars and implementing annual limits to complete built-up cars is a balanced solution.We have seen this position playing out even in case of reduction in basic customs duty rate on import of superbikes about 1600 cc of engine capacity, or in case of EV policy allowing access to a certain number of complete built up EVs subject to an investment commitment.Also, reduction in duty rates on import of whiskey was another long-standing issue which seems to be resolved not only under India UK FTA but also when India unilaterally announced reduction in the duty rate on Bourbon whiskey of US origin.All these developments are a good omen for a positive outcome in India EU FTA. EU is India’s second largest trading partner and FTA with EU would be a powerful foreign policy win for the government.The initial sound bites on the impact of India UK FTA are very encouraging but fine prints of the agreement are yet to be analyzed. Open questions are how many cars are to be allowed to be imported annually; how will the origin of such cars be established; how would the licensing and control be put in place; whether DGFT will be the nodal agency for granting and monitoring of annual quota; whether the quota will be issued on the name of company. There are many such questions which would require an answer.This newfound flexibility and decisiveness demonstrated by the government in finding win-win solutions to long pending issues is a welcome development which would open the doors of fresh economic activity which could continue to drive growth in GDP and better relationships with partner countries. And the timing of the India UK FTA can’t be better when India is also expecting to close the bilateral trade discussions with the US government. Signing of a series of new FTAs underline the success of India’s foreign policy and trade policy working together.",India UK FTA is new in the series of bilateral FTAs negotiated in the recent past.

US & China agree to cut tariffs for 90 days in bid to defuse trade war,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-china-agree-to-cut-tariffs-for-90-days-in-bid-to-defuse-trade-war/articleshow/121122737.cms,"AI image

NEW DELHI: The US-China trade deal has increased the headache for Indian negotiators, who are once again headed to Washington DC to discuss the proposed bilateral trade deal.While signalling movement towards a deal between the world's two largest trading nations, the 90-day truce, which will see them slash tariffs by 115 percentage points, opens the door for the flow of goods from China. As a result, some of the interest in Indian products is bound to come down as supply lines will reopen for 90 days, apart from some front-loading of consignments in case the pause is not extended.Explaining that many of the tariffs that he imposed remain in place, Trump said talks would be focused in part on “opening up” China to American businesses. He said he expected to talk to President Xi Jinping later this week, but putting a full deal on paper would take a while.The outcome of the frenzied weekend of negotiations in Switzerland brought tariff rates close to where they were before Trump ratcheted them higher on April 2, which he billed as “Liberation Day”. However, the talks did not appear to yield any meaningful concessions beyond an agreement to continue discussions.“We concluded that we have a shared interest,” said treasury secretary Scott Bessent at a news conference in Geneva where US and Chinese officials met over the weekend.“The consensus from both delegations is that neither side wanted a decoupling,” he said.China said it will suspend or revoke countermeasures adopted in retaliation for escalating tariffs. In early April, the Chinese govt had ordered restrictions on the export of rare earth metals and magnets, critical components used by many industries.The agreement breaks an impasse that had brought much trade between China and US to a halt. Many American businesses had suspended orders, holding out hope the two countries could strike a deal to lower the tariff rates. Economists have warned the disautomakers, aerospace manufacturers and semiconductor firms.Bessent said the two countries may also discuss purchase agreements of American goods by Chinese govt. pute will slow global growth, fuel inflation and create product shortages, potentially tipping US into a recession. “We came with a list of problems we were trying to solve, and I think we did a good job on that,” Bessent said.Global markets jumped on the announcement. The two countries said the ongoing negotiations will involve Bessent; Jamieson Greer, the US trade representative; and He Lifeng, China’s vice-premier for economic policy, who led the talks for the Chinese.Global markets jumped on the announcement. Bessent said the Chinese “understood the magnitude” of the fentanyl crisis in US and that there is a “positive path forward”.Greer said the talks were underscored by “mutual understanding and mutual respect”, but noted China was the only country to retaliate after Trump imposed reciprocal tariffs on dozens of countries last month.","The 90-day truce, which will see them slash tariffs by 115 percentage points, opens the door for the flow of goods from China.

The deal, which includes mutual tariff rollbacks, ignited a broad rally across sectors and asset classes.The S&P 500 climbed 2.6% in early trading, bringing it within 5.5% of its all-time high from February. The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 957 points, or 2.3%, while the Nasdaq composite surged 3.6%.The rally came after both nations announced substantial reductions in tariffs, a move many analysts labeled the ""best-case scenario"" from the weekend negotiations in Geneva. The US will cut tariffs on Chinese goods from highs of 145% down to 30%, while China will slash its own levies from 125% to 10%. The 90-day window is intended to provide time for deeper trade discussions aimed at resolving long-standing disputes.This development comes on the heels of last week’s US-U.K. agreement, which reduced tariffs on many British imports to 10%, further fuelling investor optimism.Markets responded with enthusiasm beyond just equities.Crude oil prices rose more than 3%, anticipating stronger global demand. The US dollar strengthened against major currencies, and Treasury yields jumped as investors dialed back expectations for aggressive interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. The 10-year Treasury yield rose to 4.45% from 4.37%, while the two-year yield jumped to 3.99% from 3.88%.Still, investors remain cautious. The tariff reductions are temporary, and Wall Street has been whipsawed before by sudden reversals in trade policy. The joint statement acknowledged “substantial progress” but also signaled significant work ahead in talks between the world’s two largest economies.Market gains were widespread. Apparel stocks surged due to their exposure to Chinese manufacturing: Lululemon soared 10%, and Nike gained 7.3%. Travel companies also rebounded, with Carnival up 8.9% and Norwegian Cruise Line rising 8%, as investors bet on a consumer spending boost. Retailers like Best Buy and Amazon rose over 7% as easing tariffs could help protect their margins and prices.Global markets mirrored the upbeat tone. European and Asian indexes posted gains, though smaller than those in the US India’s Sensex rallied 3.7% after a separate ceasefire agreement with Pakistan calmed geopolitical tensions in the region. Pakistan’s KSE 100 index skyrocketed over 9%, briefly halting trading, following both the ceasefire and the IMF’s approval of a $1 billion bailout tranche.Monday’s rally reflects investors’ relief—but also underscores how fragile market sentiment remains in the face of policy unpredictability. With only 90 days until the truce expires, eyes will be on Washington and Beijing for signs of lasting resolution.","The S&P 500 climbed 2.6% in early trading, bringing it within 5.5% of its all- time high.

US stock index futures rose sharply on Monday after the United States and China agreed to scale back tariffs, easing fears of an escalating trade war that had weighed heavily on global markets in recent weeks.US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, following talks with Chinese officials in Geneva, announced that the two nations have agreed to a 90-day pause on additional trade measures. During this period, tariffs will be reduced by over 100 percentage points, bringing them down to 10%.""This marks a pivotal moment in global trade dynamics,"" said Aaron Hill, chief analyst at FP Markets. ""However, the 90-day timeframe indicates these tariff cuts are a negotiation tactic rather than a permanent resolution, creating uncertainty about long-term trade policies.""The announcement had an immediate impact on market sentiment. At 4:08 a.m. ET:The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), commonly referred to as Wall Street's “fear gauge,” briefly slipped below 20 points for the first time since late March, before recovering slightly to 20.37, as reported new agency Reuters.Major technology and growth stocks moved higher in premarket trading. Nvidia rose 4.6%, Tesla gained 6.7%, and chipmakers Advanced Micro Devices and Marvell Technology advanced 4.9% and 7.5%, respectively.Crude oil prices climbed over 3% following the announcement, boosting energy stocks. Shares of Chevron and Exxon Mobil both rose around 2%.The development comes on the heels of a limited trade agreement between the United States and the United Kingdom, further easing concerns about the global impact of US President Donald Trump 's reciprocal tariff plans announced on April 2.As of the last close, the S&P 500 had recouped nearly all losses sustained since early April, helped by strong earnings reports and the improving trade outlook.However, not all sectors benefited. Pharmaceutical stocks slipped after President Trump said he plans to reduce US prescription drug prices to align with levels in other high-income countries — which he said were 30% to 80% lower. Pfizer, Eli Lilly, and Johnson & Johnson each dropped more than 2%.Key economic data, including consumer inflation (CPI), producer prices, and retail sales, is due later this week. In addition, several Federal Reserve officials, including Chair Jerome Powell, are scheduled to make public remarks, which could further influence market direction.Retail giants such as Walmart, as well as Cisco and Deere, are expected to report earnings in the coming days.","U.S. and China agree to 90-day pause on additional trade measures.

"SAP adjusts diversity targets, drops 40% women in workforce goal",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/sap-adjusts-diversity-targets-drops-40-women-in-workforce-goal/articleshow/121096880.cms,".

BENGALURU

: German software major SAP has adjusted its diversity and inclusion targets in accordance with developments in the US. SAP is ceasing the aspirational target of 40% for women in the workforce, the firm said in an internal communication to employees. It also substituted the ' women in executive roles ' KPI within the board's long-term incentive plan with the business health culture index (BHCI). This new index, the company said, provides a more holistic view of the full employee experience at SAP, measuring how effectively it fosters engagement, promotes health, ensures equal opportunity for all, and supports long-term employability.“We are adjusting demographic targets to meet regulatory requirements – e.g.,modifying the metric 'Women in Executive Roles' by moving from three levels below the Executive Board (set voluntarily in the past) to two levels below the Executive Board (as required by German law), not considering executive representation in the US.” SAP said that these changes reflect external realities, but they do not change the firm’s commitment. “Being a global company with a significant US presence, we are also responding to external changes as we evolve, such as recent legal developments in the US.”When TOI reached out to SAP, the company directed the publication to a statement on its website, which said, “With this, SAP also adjusts its non-financial guidance. The guidance for Women in Executive Roles will be replaced with the BHCI. SAP measured and reported the BHCI, which is based on the results of the company’s employee engagement surveys, since 2009. In 2025, SAP expects a BHCI score in the range of 80% to 82%,” it said.SAP said that it is planning a structural change to further strengthen its impact: “Adhering to the necessary country-specific legal frameworks, we aim to bring our diversity & inclusion office together with corporate social responsibility (CSR) later this year to form a unified team called 'Social Responsibility, Inclusion and Communities', within the people & culture board area,” the note said.In its 2024 integrated annual report, SAP said that the firm started measuring the women in the workforce (WiW) as the share of women in the total workforce in 2012. For this KPI, its previous goal was to reach 35% by 2022, which it reached before 2022.""We're also planning a structural change to further strengthen our impact: Adhering to the necessary country-specific legal frameworks, we aim to bring our Diversity & Inclusion office together with corporate social responsibility (CSR) later this year to form a unified team called 'Social Responsibility, Inclusion and Communities', within the people & culture board area,"" SAP said in an email to employees.","SAP is ceasing the aspirational target of 40% for women in the workforce.

Asian markets rally on hopes of tariff relief after US-China talks,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/asian-markets-rally-on-hopes-of-tariff-relief-after-us-china-talks/articleshow/121093163.cms,"Stocks across Asia surged on Monday as investors' sentiments were boosted by signs of easing tensions between the United States and China after a weekend of high-level trade talks.Benchmark indexes in Japan and South Korea edged higher in early morning trading, while US futures pointed to a strong start on Wall Street, with the S&P 500 expected to open more than 1% higher.The Shanghai Index was trading at 3,359.52, up 17.52 points or 0.52%. Japan’s Nikkei rose 16.47 points or 0.04% to 37,519.8, while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index gained 203.88 points or 0.89% to reach 23,071.62, at 8.41 am.The boost came after meetings between US and Chinese officials in Geneva concluded on Sunday with what both sides described as meaningful progress.US treasury secretary Scott Bessent said “substantial progress” had been made, while China's vice premier He Lifeng described the talks as “candid, in-depth and constructive.” Further details are expected to be released later on Monday.These were the first formal talks between Washington and Beijing since US President Donald Trump hiked tariffs on Chinese imports to a punishing 145%, prompting China to retaliate with its own steep duties of 125% on American goods, effectively halting much of the trade between the two economic giants.The deepening trade war has rattled global financial markets and raised the risk of a worldwide economic slowdown. Investors are now hopeful that the recent talks could be the first step towards rolling back some of the tariffs.Analysts at Wedbush Securities called the meeting “a positive step in the right direction,” adding that the agreement expected to be unveiled this week would likely feature “a much lower level” of tariffs at minimum.China reported last week that its exports to the US plunged 21% in April compared to a year ago, and early signs of a possible recession are starting to emerge in the United States.Although few expected any major breakthrough over the weekend, recent comments from Trump and other US officials have suggested that tariffs could come down significantly. The President last week floated a possible reduction to 80%, while Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said reciprocal tariffs might eventually settle around 34%.Markets will be keeping a close eye on the details of the agreement, but for now, the Geneva deal has sparked optimism.","Stocks across Asia surged on Monday as investors' sentiments were boosted by signs of easing tensions. Benchmark indexes in Japan and South Korea edged higher in early morning trading. US futures pointed to a strong start on Wall Street, with the S&P 500 expected to open more than 1% higher.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121094198,imgsize-1747732,width-400,resizemode-4/121094198.jpg"
Saudi oil giant Aramco's profits drop over 4% as oil prices fall,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/saudi-oil-giant-aramcos-profits-drop-over-4-as-oil-prices-fall/articleshow/121075542.cms,"Saudi Arabia's oil giant, Aramco, has reported a 4.6% decline in its first-quarter profits, weighed down by falling global oil prices, which have pressurised the country's ambitious multi-trillion-dollar development plans.The company posted $26 billion in net profit for the quarter ending March against the $27.2 billion earned during the same period last year. However, the company’s revenue stood at $108.1 billion, marginally higher than last year’s $107.2 billion.“Global trade dynamics affected energy markets in the first quarter of 2025, with economic uncertainty impacting oil prices,” Aramco president and CEO Amin H Nasser said.The results were released in a stock exchange filing on Riyadh’s Tadawul market on Sunday.Aramco’s shares were trading above $6 on Thursday, down from about $8 last year, following a steady decline over the past year as oil prices have fallen. Only a small portion of Aramco is traded on the Tadawul stock exchange, while most of the company is owned by the Saudi government, which uses the profits to fund national spending and support the Al Saud royal family’s wealth.Aramco, officially the Saudi Arabian Oil Co., is the world’s sixth most valuable company with a market worth over $1.6 trillion and is regarded as a key player in shaping global oil market trends The results come as OPEC+ plans to increase oil production by 411,000 barrels per day next month, as the middle eastern economy continues to be rippled by US tariffs uncertainties.

China's consumer prices fall for third month amid ongoing economic struggles,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/chinas-consumer-prices-fall-for-third-month-amid-ongoing-economic-struggles/articleshow/121056800.cms,"Representative image (Picture credit: ANI)

Consumer prices in China fell for the third month in April as the country grapples with sluggish spending amid a fierce trade war with the United States.The latest data, released on Saturday by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), showed that the consumer price index (CPI), a crucial inflation measure, dropped by 0.1 percent year-on-year. This marks a continuation of the downward trend observed in February and March, reflecting deep-rooted challenges for the world's second-largest economy.The world’s second largest economy has been struggling with deflationary pressures in recent years, facing longstanding woes in the property and exports sector.NBS statistician Dong Lijuan commented on the figures, attributing the decline to ""international imported factors"" which have led to lower prices in certain industries.These figures come at a critical time for the Asian giant, just ahead of key economic talks between officials from China and the United States in Switzerland. The two countries have been long engaged in a tit for tat tariff situation, with the US imposing a staggering 145% duty on many imports, which may reach as high as 245% overall.President Donald Trump had hinted on Friday that tariffs could be reduced to 80 percent, though Beijing has consistently called for a full cancellation of the levies that continue to pressurise the economy.Despite these external pressures, Chinese exports managed to rise in April, with a notable shift in trade routes to Southeast Asia. Exports to countries such as Thailand, Indonesia, and Vietnam saw double-digit growth, compensating for a sharp drop in exports to the United States.The producer price index (PPI), another key inflation indicator. also dropped by 2.7 percent year-on-year in April, a steeper decline than March's 2.5 percent drop. This further reflected broader challenges in China's manufacturing and export sectors.""Changes in the international trade environment and a rapid decline in some international bulk commodities have affected the decline in prices in related domestic industries,"" Dong said.According to trade figures from China's customs bureau, exports to the United States saw a major decline in April. However, shipments to Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand, Indonesia, and Vietnam, experienced double-digit growth.Chinese policymakers have recently relaxed key monetary policy measures, in efforts to stimulate domestic economic activity. These include cuts to a major interest rate and a reduction in the reserve requirements for banks, designed to encourage more lending.","Consumer prices in China fell for the third month in April as the country grapples with sluggish spending amid a fierce trade war with the United States.

India registered a formal protest, citing Pakistan’s poor track record with IMF reforms and expressing fears of fund diversion. New Delhi abstained from the vote.“Rewarding continued sponsorship of cross-border terrorism sends a dangerous message,” the finance ministry said in a statement.“It exposes funding agencies and donors to reputational risks and undermines global values.”Pakistan’s Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif welcomed the development, describing it as a “defeat of India’s high-handed tactics” and a sign of international confidence in Pakistan’s economic recovery. “Indian attempts to sabotage the IMF programme have failed,” the Pak's PMO said, accusing India of plotting “a conspiracy to divert attention” through “unilateral aggression.”The new disbursement brings total IMF funding to Pakistan under the EFF to around $2 billion. The full $7 billion package, agreed in July last year, is structured over 39 months in seven instalments, contingent on successful reforms including tax restructuring, energy sector reforms, and pricing adjustments in utilities and industries.The IMF and Pakistan reached a staff-level agreement in March on the first biannual review, which included commitments such as the introduction of a carbon levy and tariff revisions.","The International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Friday approved the immediate disbursement of $1 billion to Pakistan.

US stocks are drifting Friday as Wall Street heads toward the end of an unusually quiet week.The S&P 500 was up 0.4 percent in morning trading and on track to erase what had been a small loss for the week. This may be the first week in seven where the index at the heart of many 401(k) accounts moves by less than 1.5 per cent, after swinging sharply first on fears about President Donald Trump's trade war and then on hopes that he'll relent on some of his tariffs.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 86 points, or 0.2 per cent, as of 10 am Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite was 0.6 per cent higher.The big event for the week is likely coming on Saturday, when trading will be closed in financial markets. That's when high-level US and Chinese officials will be meeting in Switzerland for their first talks since Trump launched an escalating trade war between the world's two largest economies.The fear among investors and economists is that a recession could hit if the United States doesn't reach trade deals that lower tariffs by enough and quickly enough.Trump on Friday floated the idea of bringing tariffs on Chinese imports down to 80 per cent from their current 145 per cent rate, but he said it'll be up to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who will be in Switzerland. While that would indeed be a reduction, it would still be high, and Trump's posting on social media caused a brief jolt in financial markets.Futures for US stocks sank immediately.But markets later calmed as the wait continued for what US and Chinese officials will say after their meeting.Trump also talked up the potential for more trade deals that could be on the way, following his announcement the day before on an agreement with the United Kingdom.""Many Trade Deals in the hopper, all good (GREAT!) ones!"" he said on his Truth Social network.In the meantime, the flow of earnings reports for the start of the year from companies is slowing but still moving the market.Lyft rallied 20.3 per cent after delivering a stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected, though its revenue fell short. The company said it reached the highest weekly ridership levels in its history during the last week of March.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, the chip giant known as TSMC, offered an encouraging report after saying its revenue in April leaped 48.1 per cent from a year earlier. That sent its stock that trades in the United States up 1.8 per cent.Insulet jumped 15.8 per cent for the biggest gain in the S&P 500 after the medical device company reported stronger results for the latest quarter than analysts expected. The company, which sells tubeless insulin pump technology, also raised its forecast for an underlying revenue trend for the full year.They helped offset a 7.5 per cent drop for Expedia. The travel website, which owns Vrbo and Hotels.com, reported a stronger profit than analysts expected, but it also said demand was weaker than it expected during the quarter. It highlighted softer-than-expected demand in the United States, as well as a nearly 30 per cent decline in bookings from Canada to its southern neighbor.Other travel-related companies, including Hilton and Airbnb, have reported a similar softening in travel demand to the US in their recent earnings reports.In stock markets abroad, indexes were higher in Europe after finishing mixed in Asia.Stocks rose 0.4 per cent in Hong Kong but fell 0.3 per cent in Shanghai after China reported that its exports rose at a faster-than-expected 8.1 per cent annual pace in April. Exports to the United States dropped more than 20 per cent, however, as Trump's steep tariff increases took effect.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume.

Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021.

The startup has a total of 18 employees and is just opening an office in the city.""What we are showing is that you can build large language models with limited resources,” Raghavan said in a phone interview. ""We are building at a smaller scale and demonstrating that these can be extremely cost and energy efficient so they can be accessed by everyone.""Large language models, like OpenAI’s GPT-4 and Meta Platforms Inc.’s Llama, are powerful AI systems that understand by learning from vast amounts of diverse data from the internet and elsewhere to summarize, translate, and create text, audio and video for a wide range of applications. The rivalry to develop ever-more sophisticated models is heating up in Silicon Valley and such efforts have attracted billions of dollars in investments.","Sarvam AI is building large language models targeted at unique uses in Indian languages at price points that the country’s 1.4 billion people can afford.

Startups will play important role in helping India become 3rd largest economy: CEA Nageswaran,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/startups-will-play-important-role-in-helping-india-become-3rd-largest-economy-cea-nageswaran/articleshow/105332523.cms,"Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor ( CEA ) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran Udaan until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.Udaan built an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business still accounts for a very small part of India’s overall retail market but can balloon to $150 billion in sales and yield a 100% return on capital invested in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co. estimates published in the Mint newspaper.Bengaluru-based Udaan has also ventured into financing through its fintech unit which helps shopkeepers get working capital loans to buy inventory. That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says.

Space sector start-up Sisir Radar to develop SAR on L/P band SAR,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/space-sector-start-up-sisir-radar-to-develop-sar-on-l/p-band-sar/articleshow/104558111.cms,"CHENNAI: Space sector startup, Sisir Radar Private Ltd has hit success at the prestigious iDEX DefSpace Challenge with its projects for development of “L/P band Continuous Wave SAR (synthetic aperture radar) payload for LEO Small Satellites” and “Unfurlable, Electronically Steering Antenna for L/P band SAR payload” for Indian Air Force (IAF), said a top company official.The company is promoted by former Director at the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) Tapan Misra and the brains behind the Indian space agency’s RISAT series of SAR satellites as well as the Dual Frequency SAR on the Chandrayaan 2 orbiter that is currently circling the moon.""A grant of Rs 3 crore is also there for development of the products,"" Misra told IANS.Synthetic Aperture Radar or SAR is a special kind of imaging radar technology that can provide extremely accurate high resolution imagery of the terrain through clouds, smoke and dust even in pitch dark conditions. SAR imagery provides much higher resolution than other forms of remote sensing technology such as hyperspectral and multispectral. SAR is a critical technology for strategic reconnaissance and planning as well as for disaster management.According to Misra, winning the challenge in just over a year of floating the company is a major booster.He said L and P band SAR have an advantage over other frequencies (like X band) when it comes to penetration capabilities through rain, clouds, foliage and vegetation in a tropical country like India, and underground penetration capabilities in dry terrain.Continuing further, he said the L band SAR will provide 1 metre resolution, spotlight resolution in Stripmap mode. The current industry standard is 5-10 metre in L band. Misra said both the L and P band will operate simultaneously from a satellite borne SAR. Recently, Sisir Radar successfully developed and tested the world’s highest resolution L-Band SAR fitted on a drone. With 0.2 metre resolution, this is by far the highest L band SAR in the world, he said.","Space sector startup, Sisir Radar Private Ltd has hit success at the prestigious iDEX DefSpace Challenge.

Testify: Sam Bankman-Fried acknowledges 'mistakes' but testifies he did not defraud anyone,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/cryptocurrency/sam-bankman-fried-acknowledges-mistakes-but-testifies-he-did-not-defraud-anyone/articleshow/104761929.cms,"<p>Sam Bankman-Fried (File Photo- Reuters)<br></p>

NEW YORK: Sam Bankman-Fried , testifying in his own defense at his fraud trial on Friday, acknowledged that a ""lot of people got hurt"" when the FTX cryptocurrency exchange he founded collapsed, but said he did not defraud anyone or take customer funds.Shortly after taking the witness stand in Manhattan federal court, Bankman-Fried said he made ""a number of small mistakes and a number of larger mistakes"" while running the now-bankrupt exchange. The biggest mistake, he said, was not implementing a dedicated risk management team.""We thought that we might be able to build the best product on the market,"" Bankman-Fried said. ""It turned out basically the opposite of that. A lot of people got hurt - customers, employees - and the company ended up in bankruptcy.""Prosecutors accuse Bankman-Fried of using FTX customer funds to prop up his crypto-focused hedge fund, Alameda Research, make speculative venture investments and donate more than $100 million to US political campaigns. He also faces charges of scheming to cheat Alameda's lenders and FTX investors.He has pleaded not guiltyBankman-Fried's trial, which began on October 3, is drawing to a close nearly a year after FTX collapsed amid a wave of customer withdrawals. The company declared bankruptcy in November 2022 and Bankman-Fried was indicted the following month.His testimony marked the first time the dozen jurors and five alternates have heard directly from the 31-year-old former billionaire after 12 trial days.Bankman-Fried, who was jailed in August after US District Judge Lewis Kaplan found he likely tampered with witnesses, wore a suit and spoke with two water bottles placed in front of him on the witness stand. The former mogul once known for wearing shorts and T-shirts and sporting an unkempt mop of curly locks cut his hair before his trial began.Responding to questions posed by his defense lawyer Mark Cohen, Bankman-Fried spoke in calm, measured tones during the first portion of his testimony as he recounted founding Alameda in 2017, shortly after graduating from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, despite knowing little about crypto.But Bankman-Fried - who had studied physics and worked as a quantitative trader at Jane Street - said he saw opportunities for ""arbitrage"" in the market for digital assets. He said Alameda's first office was in a small Airbnb in Berkeley, California, before he later moved the firm to Hong Kong.""We wanted to be under the radar at that point in time,"" he said on the stand, adding he named the hedge fund after the California county where it was founded in part so competitors would not discover what they were doing.Jurors have heard from three of his closest confidantes at FTX and Alameda, all of whom have pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors. They testified earlier this month that they committed financial crimes at Bankman-Fried's behest.For criminal defendants, taking the stand is a risky proposition because it opens them up to potentially probing cross-examination by prosecutors.But given Bankman-Fried's penchant for risk, legal experts say he likely viewed taking the stand as his best shot to counter the allegations made by members of his inner circle, which were backed up by spreadsheets the three said demonstrated how customer funds were stolen and text messages in which they discussed FTX's shortfall of funds with Bankman-Fried.","Sam Bankman-Fried says he made ""a number of small mistakes and a number of larger mistakes"" while running the now-bankrupt exchange.

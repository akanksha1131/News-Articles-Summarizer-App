PAN Card misuse crackdown

Big crackdown on PAN details unauthorised use! The Indian Cybercrime Coordination Centre (I4C), operating under the Union home ministry, has directed the cessation of unauthorized usage of Indian citizens' Permanent Account Numbers (PAN) by financial technology companies and other consumer tech firms, informed sources told ET.The government is taking stringent action against technology companies' unauthorized handling of personal data as it moves forward with implementing the Digital Private Data Protection Act, 2023 (DPDP).""This was known as a 'Pan enrichment' service, which would help loan distribution companies create a profile of their customers against their Pan numbers, for cross sell of credit and other financial products,"" said a top executive at a fintech firm on the condition of anonymity.""Sometimes this data was also used to cross check the details put in by the customer in his or her application form,"" he added.Recent weeks have seen disruptions in these services as government intervention has led to the closure of many unauthorized operations, according to reliable sources.Based on information from three industry experts, numerous firms accessed customers' personal information, including full names, addresses, phone numbers, and other details by utilizing their PAN numbers through Income Tax department's backend systems. One executive highlighted that PAN numbers' connection to consumer credit scores made it particularly valuable data.This practice, while not a data breach, represented unauthorized access to Income Tax department's backend infrastructure, which technology service providers maintain.Also Read | Booking a train ticket? New Indian Railways train ticket reservation rules effective from November 1 - check details ""There has been no disruption in the authorised service which is through the National Securities Depository (NSDL), where they do not share any personal data against the Pan number but just says whether the details provided match with their database,"" the executive added.Several industry sources indicated that this unauthorized service was widely used by various financial entities, including consumer lending platforms, loan sourcing channels, direct sales agents, and credit aggregators, though identifying specific companies is challenging as these practices were part of their internal operations.An executive mentioned earlier suggested these actions align with the government's broader initiative to eliminate unauthorized access to Indian citizens' Personal Identifiable Information (PII), which will be examined thoroughly after data protection rules are implemented.Under the DPDP Act of 2023, businesses must obtain proper consent and use authorized channels when processing citizens' information.""After the Supreme Court judgement on Aadhaar, the rules around access to this database had gotten codified and formalised; now the government will crackdown on every unauthorised access to any government database,"" the executive said.Industry experts acknowledge that while the restrictions may cause operational challenges, they believe this will ultimately help organizations align their systems with upcoming stringent data protection regulations.","The government is taking stringent action against technology companies' unauthorized handling of personal data.

(AI image)

DA Hike Calculator: How much will the take home salary increase?

To understand the impact of this 3% DA hike, let's consider an example:

Assuming a central government employee has a basic pay of Rs 46,200, their previous dearness allowance at 50% was Rs 23,100. With the DA now at 53%, their dearness allowance will increase to Rs 24,486.

This means they will receive an additional Rs 1,386 (Rs 24,486 - Rs 23,100) in DA from October. As the DA hike is effective from July 1, 2024, they will also receive arrears for the last three months.

DR Hike Calculator: How much will the pension increase?

If a central government pensioner receives a basic pension of Rs 50,400 per month, at the previous 50% DR, they were getting Rs 25,200.

With the DR now at 53%, they will receive Rs 26,712 monthly as dearness relief. This means their pension will increase by Rs 1,512 per month.

DA hike calculator : PM Narendra Modi-led Union Cabinet has approved a 3% increase in the dearness allowance (DA) for central government employees on October 16, 2024. Additionally, the dearness relief (DR) for central government pensioners has also been raised by 3%. As a result of this latest hike, the DA and DR now stand at 53% for both central government employees and pensioners respectively. This decision is set to benefit over 1 crore individuals.The dearness allowance, a component of the salary for government employees and pensioners, has been increased to 53%. This rise in DA will lead to an increase in the take-home salary of central government employees starting from October 2024.The effective date for the increased DA and DR is July 1, 2024.

Railway Budget 2024 : The government has wavered little in its efforts to spur a modernisation of railways in the country, pivoting on technology, to support the country’s economic ambitions. In line with expectations, Union Budget 2024-25 set the capex for railways at a record Rs 2.65 lakh crore, marking yet another year of successive increase in outlay. That takes forward the past policies and the government’s vision, which have paved the way for modernisation of the transport behemoth.In earlier decades, the government had focused on laying tracks on new routes, electrification and incremental rolling stock capacity addition. That was the need of the hour back then and has helped set up the base for a larger transformation.For instance, the massive Dedicated Freight Corridor ( DFC ) as well as locomotive factories at Marhaura and Madhepura in Bihar were conceptualised over a decade ago and we are seeing their completion now.More recently, the focus has shifted to modernisation—of rolling stock and safety systems, among other aspects.This year, emphasis has also been laid on the railways’ crucial role in industrial development. Commodity-specific corridors have been planned in eastern India and impetus given to port connectivity. Vande Bharat and technology-led upgrades in rolling stock remain in focus. Safety has been prioritised through budgetary allocations for the anti-collision systemKavach . That said, there are other cogs in the wheel that demand attention from a long-term perspective.First, the target for the Operating Ratio, the crucial efficiency gauge, has been set at 98.22% for 2024-25, compared with 98.65% in 2023-24. This reflects an imminent need for operational transformation. An effective overhaul of the world’s fourth-largest rail network will take many years and thus we need to start focusing on improving efficiency and reducing costs now.DFC is almost entirely operational and will be complete over the next few months. To ensure the project achieves its twin goals of reducing logistics costs and enhancing freight efficiency, railways need to attract more cargo on the corridor. This will help increase the rail coefficient and make the railways’ approach more market-oriented, which will in turn aid future corridors.A revamp of railway stations is on track, with sufficient funds dedicated to this end. But even though new coaches and wagons are increasingly being added to meet footfalls, the stations and passenger trains themselves remain synonymous with chaos.Just as safety, comfort and convenience have been prioritised, there is a need for solutions to address the capacity and demand challenges. As a first step, the government could target development of new stations and setting up of new coach production units.As a leading freight mover, Indian Railways carried a record 1,588 MT cargo in fiscal 2024, up from 1,095 MT in fiscal 2015. It accounts for 26% of the cargo moved in the country—by no means an easy feat. The railways aims to take this volume to 3,000 MT by 2030, which would require a 11% CAGR against the around 4.2% witnessed over the last 10 years. As per a report by TERI and Shakti Foundation, from carrying about 62% of freight traffic in 1990-91, Indian Railways’ share has declined to ~27% in 2014-15. This has been due to the expanding road network, cost competitiveness over railways, and door-to-door service. Thus, commencing the cycle of increasing the rail share again is commendable.DFCs, a high-capacity track network, high-power locomotives and improvement in wagon designs have set the ball rolling for larger capacity, faster freight trains that deliver better efficiency.Yet, achieving exponential growth is a tall ask given the current dynamics. Possibly, similar challenges might apply to other goals the railways might have for 2047.To be fair, despite its scale and complexity, Indian Railways has been able to achieve diverse developments at commendable speed.But the track ahead is long and it is time to start discussing the reinvention of the institutional set-up.Indian Railways sees substantial private sector involvement in the form of vendors and contractors. Policymakers could start mulling extreme options such as parallel privately-owned and operated railway infrastructure, coupled with centralised planning and an evolved role for the railways. This will need a robust policy framework from the Government of India.The time is perhaps also ripe to bring user charge and asset monetisation-driven segments for passengers as well as cargo to the discussion table. Globally, the separation of infrastructure and operations in railways has delivered mixed results, for example in the United Kingdom. The model should be analysed and revisited to understand its potential relevance in the Indian context.The key would be to retrace our steps and align our long-term goals to identify not just incremental changes but also ways to explore bold and path-breaking alternatives that put Indian Railways on a smooth track and bring it up to speed.","Union Budget 2024-25 set the capex for railways at a record Rs 2.65 lakh crore.

Budget 2024 capital gains tax changes: The Narendra Modi government is considering suggestions for tweaks in the new long term capital gains tax regime that was announced by FM Nirmala Sitharaman in Union Budget 2024.The July 23 budget reduced the LTCG tax on property from 20% to 12.5%. The indexation benefit, which allowed taxpayers to adjust the acquisition cost for inflation before calculating capital gains and thus reduce their tax liability, is proposed to be eliminated for properties purchased on or after April 1, 2001.The government publishes the Cost Inflation Index (CII) annually for this calculation.India Inc is appealing to the government for a gradual shift to the long-term capital gains tax regime proposed in the FY25 budget, which aims to eliminate indexation benefits for property, gold, and other unlisted assets.According to an ET report by Deepshikha Sikarwar, the industry is suggesting alternatives such as a higher tax rate with indexation or a lower rate of 12.5% without indexation, as well as some form of grandfathering for ancestral properties.The finance ministry is currently reviewing these proposals and will discuss them with the Prime Minister's Office. The final decision will be made closer to the date when the Finance Bill reply is to be presented in Parliament, the reports said.Industry groups are expected to submit formal proposals to the finance ministry in the near future. ""We are proposing that some time be given to taxpayers for transition,"" said an official with a leading industry lobby group.Also Read | New Budget 2024 rule: Why Income Tax Department is likely to issue a huge number of tax notices this month The finance ministry has already conducted one round of discussions regarding the concerns raised by various stakeholders about the move, including the potential increase in black money transactions.""Since the sudden transition to a new capital gains regime impacts existing properties held by taxpayers, the amendment has a retroactive impact for such taxpayers,"" said an official with another industry body supporting a transition regime.The proposed suggestions include giving the seller of a property the option of either a 20% LTCG rate with indexation or a 12.5% LTCG rate without that benefit.""As per tax policy diligently followed by the current government, any drastic change in regime has been made in a gradual manner, by providing options to taxpayers to choose between the old regime and new regime,"" said Sudhir Kapadia, senior advisor at EY, supporting the suggestion.Also Read | How Budget 2024 announcements will spur balanced growth of real estate sector He cited examples such as domestic companies having the choice between a concessional 22% tax rate under Section 115 BAA without incentives and deductions, or the normal 30% tax rate after claiming permitted tax incentives and deductions, as well as individual taxpayers having the choice between two separate tax regimes—one with deductions and the other without.

Budget 2024 for manufacturing sector : The recent Union Budget has struck a balance between fiscal consolidation and stimulating economic growth. While the middle class has been offered tax relief, the government's primary focus remains on judicious spending to maximize economic impact. The budget's core themes are employment, skilling, MSME development, and support for the middle class.Largely focus has remained intact on spending money judiciously to ensure that each penny spent creates a ripple effect in the entire economic landscape.Although at first glance, manufacturing might appear to have taken a backseat, a deeper analysis reveals a multifaceted approach to bolstering the sector. Initiatives like employment-linked benefits and internship programs, while primarily aimed at job creation and skill development, indirectly benefit manufacturing companies by expanding the talent pool.Extensive focus on the MSME manufacturing units by way of extending term loan facility for purchase of machinery and equipment without collateral or third-party guarantee, would help companies in augmenting their capital base/ capacity and strengthen the very foundation of the manufacturing ecosystem in the country. Development of a new credit-assessment model by Public Sector Banks to assess MSME credit shall provide much needed regulatory relief to the units.With respect to the large manufacturing entities, while there is no direct fiscal/ tax incentive introduced in this budget, some support has been provided with an extensive focus on development of ‘industrial parks’ in nearly 100 cities under the ‘plug and play’ model. Reforms proposed with respect to land administration, planning and management, shall also ease out acquisition related difficulties often faced by entrepreneurs/ business houses in acquiring lands for manufacturing set-ups.Targeted Customs duty interventions like, rationalization of Customs duty provisions in Mobile phone manufacturing setups, extension of Customs duty exemption on import of capital goods for manufacturing of solar cells and panels, full Customs duty exemption on import of 25 critical minerals,, shall provide the required impetus for enhancing domestic manufacturing environment.Governments’ focus on formulating an Economic Policy Framework to set the scope for next-gen reforms in the country, has a target to improve the productivity of factors of production, namely, land, labour, capital, entrepreneurship and technology. This shall pave the way for enabling achievement of a target of 25% manufacturing sector contribution to the nation’s GDP over the course of next 7-10 years.While the overall outlook is positive, the extension of tax benefits under Section 115BAB for manufacturing entities and the absence of new PLI schemes are notable omissions.The country’s manufacturing base is expanding as is reflective from the continuously increasing tax collections and expanding Purchasing Manager’s Index. It would be pertinent to see how the ground realities evolve vis-à-vis the vision envisaged, in the upcoming Financial Year.","While the overall outlook is positive, the extension of tax benefits under Section 115BAB for manufacturing entities and the absence of new PLI schemes are notable omissions.

Budget 2024: Armed with the vision to propel India to become a developed country by 2047, the Union Budget 2024 aims to focus largely towards strengthening the Make in India initiative and ease of doing business thereby providing the required stimulus to the manufacturing sector and enabling large scale job creation.On the Indirect tax front, the industry welcomes the much-needed announcement for a comprehensive review of the rate structure under Customs enabling ease in product classification and dispute reduction.The proposal of lowering of Customs duty on a plethora of raw materials and products including solar cells, critical minerals and bullion are encouraging measures. The rationale behind such reduction clearly indicates support towards domestic manufacturing, deepening value addition and supporting targets in reducing carbon footprint.Relevant amendments under the Customs law have been made to provide increased time limits for re-imports and re-exports to enhance competitiveness of the fledgling MRO sector. The government has extended significant duty reduction and exemption benefits to the healthcare and electronics sectors, continuing the impetus of incentives provided under the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme.Since their introduction in March 2020, the PLI schemes have indeed supported in revitalizing the manufacturing sector and strengthening the necessary supply chains. The success achieved in the mobile manufacturing sector has now enabled the Government to reduce customs duties on mobile phones and components, signalling a mature environment. The Budget proposals aim at reproducing similar outcomes for semiconductor and pharmaceutical industry by increasing the budgetary allocation.Buoyed by the increasing revenue collection under GST signalling a shift towards a mature tax regime, this Budget has harmonized the timeframes for the issuance of demand notices and adjudication orders for cases involving fraud, suppression or otherwise. Significant amendments to the GST legislations have been introduced reflecting the recommendations proposed by the GST Council such as regularizing non-levy of GST due to general practice which may turn out to be a breather for certain impacted industries reeling under huge tax demands.The Insurance sector has been provided much relief through the GST council recommendations which have been cemented in the present budget thereby ending long standing disputes on their business practices.The Government's efforts to push forward with its reform agenda are evident as plans to incentivize states for their business reform actions plans and digitalization through the Jan Vishwas Bill 2.0 is proposed. Further, setting up of e-commerce export hubs is envisaged to facilitate easier access to international markets for domestic players.The recent implementation of Budget proposals allows the government to maintain momentum in its reform agenda. These policy measures implicitly reaffirm the significance of India Inc as a crucial element in the development of infrastructure. However, there are still some expectations required to be met to march towards a Viksit Bharat 2047.",Union Budget 2024 aims to focus largely towards strengthening the Make in India initiative and ease of doing business.

Budget 2024 : Real estate, a significant contributor to employment generation, has received a fair bit of attention in Budget 2024-25. Recent years have seen the sector transform rapidly, driven by factors such as favourable government policies, Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016, strong economic growth and changing consumer preferences.Added to that, the budgetary focus on job creation, skilling and employment-linked incentives, infrastructure, urban development, rural connectivity, digitalisation and land-related norms, all dovetail to promote growth of the sector.Launched in June 2015, the PMAY aims to provide affordable housing to all eligible beneficiaries. The budget unveiled PMAY Urban 2.0, under which the housing needs of 1 crore urban poor and middle class will be addressed with an investment of Rs 10 lakh crore.The central government’s additional Rs 2.2 lakh crore injection in the next 5 years to make housing more affordable has the potential to revitalise the affordable housing market.Such an approach can play an important role in realising the government's vision of Housing for All and push growth and development. Hence, the significant investment under PMAY Urban 2.0 is expected to alleviate urban housing deficits, spurring construction and economic growth.Steps to introduce technological reforms within the regulatory framework for land, such as digitalisation or GIS mapping of land records, will improve transparency.Rationalisation of stamp duty across states will also be critical to bring in uniformity and initiate land-related reforms such as urban planning, usage and building bylaws.These are steps in the right direction and will boost growth. Moreover, they will improve the ease of property transactions and strengthen municipal finances through increased property taxes. Rationalization of stamp duty with an emphasis on women homebuyers may boost home-buyer sentiment in major cities, too.The budget has also given ample attention to urban and rural development, with rental housing for industrial workers through the public private partnership model, interest subsidies for rental housing, and transit-oriented developments.The proposal to develop investment-ready plug-and-play industrial parks in 100 cities may attract industrial investment, leading to increased demand for industrial real estate and support the growth of ancillary services and residential developments in these regions.Initiatives for industrial parks and rental housing for industrial workers align with the country’s manufacturing goals and addresses worker accommodation needs.These steps are expected to promote industrial growth and stability in labour-intensive sectors, while also creating new opportunities for real estate developers specialising in rental and affordable housing.The changes in long-term capital gains (LTCG) tax, however, have evoked a mixed reaction. The government lowered the long-term capital gains tax from 20% to 12.5%, which is a welcome step. However, this came with the removal of the indexation benefit.The changes could encourage more liquidity in property transactions and potentially increase the effective tax burden depending on the property’s acquisition date.The launch of Phase IV of the PM Gram Sadak Yojana in 25,000 rural habitations will improve connectivity in rural areas, promoting rural development and making these regions more accessible for investment. The primary objective of PMGSY is to build robust, all-weather roads in rural habitations. This initiative focuses on enhancing connectivity and supporting economic development in rural areas.In essence, the budget is geared towards stimulating growth and investment in the real estate sector , fostering a more transparent and investor-friendly environment, and contributing to overall development. It aims to create a balanced and inclusive growth environment by addressing the needs of various segments, including affordable housing, industrial workers and urban infrastructure.The effectiveness of the initiatives, however, hinges on their implementation and continued support of complementary reforms.",The central government’s additional Rs 2.2 lakh crore injection in the next 5 years to make housing more affordable has the potential to revitalise the affordable housing market.

New Budget 2024 rule: Why Income Tax Department is likely to issue a huge number of tax notices this month,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/new-budget-2024-rule-why-income-tax-department-is-likely-to-issue-a-huge-number-of-tax-notices-this-month/articleshow/112186079.cms,"Taxing Times

Income Tax Notice on the way? The Income Tax Department is gearing up to send out a large number of notices in the coming month, as there are concerns that many taxpayers might escape the tax net due to the impending implementation of the new reassessment law on September 1, 2024.According to the amended regulation announced in Budget 2024 , the tax authorities can only go back a maximum of five years to reassess a taxpayer's records if the escaped income is at least Rs 50 lakh, and three years for an amount less than Rs 50 lakh.Previously, they could reassess cases up to 10 years old.According to an ET report, tax officials are now faced with the challenge of compiling and corroborating data on tax and income mismatches for the financial years 2013-14 to 2017-18 within the next few weeks, as these years will become time-barred for reassessment from September 1, 2024.The I-T department relies on information from various sources, such as banks, property registrars, and search findings from the investigation wing, to build reassessment cases.A tax officers' body has raised concerns about the feasibility of issuing notices under Section 148 (or 148A) in a large number of cases within a single month, given the overburdened nature of the jurisdictional assessing officers and the time-consuming process of obtaining sanction from the chief commissioner, who is the specified authority for such notices.Moreover, the law provides taxpayers with the right to explain their position before reassessment orders are finalized, a process that most believe cannot be completed by the end of August.Also Read | ITR refund status for FY 2023-24: How to check income tax refund status online - here’s a step-by-step guide for incometax.gov.in & NSDL websites The Central Board of Direct Taxes ( CBDT ) has been urged by its officers to postpone the effective date of the proposed amendment. However, this suggestion is unlikely to be well-received by corporations and high net worth individuals.""Capping the reassessment period at five years was a great decision as it would reduce hassles and litigation. But if the department fears there could be a genuine loss of revenue as it may not be possible to wrap up several matters by August 31, the government can think of strict parameters where time-bound cases can be selectively reopened - based on trails of steps taken in identifying escaped income,"" said Mitil Chokshi, partner at CA firm Chokshi & Chokshi.""Taxpayers may expect a rush of reassessment notices in August 2024. These notices are likely to be for the AYs 2018-19 and prior to that. It is pertinent to note that the Bombay High Court in a recent ruling in a case of Hexaware Technologies has taken a view on a proviso introduced in 2021, which can be interpreted to mean that AY 2017-18 (and prior years) got time barred on March 31, 2024. These reassessment notices (for AYs 2017-18 and prior) are likely to rake up new interpretation issues in the already muddled reassessment provisions,"" said Ashish Mehta, partner at law firm Khaitan & Co.The current situation is similar to the conflict between the Income Tax office and taxpayers in 2021. The reassessment law was amended in April 2021, allowing the tax office to reopen 10-year-old tax returns if the total undisclosed income exceeded Rs 50 lakh and reassess 4-year-old matters if the amount was less than Rs 50 lakh.Also Read | Latest NPS rules 2024: How much tax will you save with new NPS contribution benefit under new regime after Budget 2024? However, this change led to over 10,000 writ petitions being filed by companies, arguing that they were not given sufficient time to explain and that the notices were issued without considering the carve-out that cases which couldn't be reopened earlier couldn't be reassessed under the new law.The Supreme Court invoked its extraordinary powers under Article 142 of the Constitution on May 4, 2022, to uphold all reassessment notices issued after March 31, 2021. However, the court left room for judicial proceedings based on the merits of each case, and several such matters are currently pending before the court.","The Income Tax Department is gearing up to send out a large number of notices in the coming month.

How NPS will increase tax savings

NPS and EPF: Overlapping services

What is NPS Vatsalaya?

Latest NPS rules, news: In the Union Budget 2024 speech, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced two new initiatives with regard to National Pension Scheme (NPS) - extension of NPS 14% employer contribution benefits to private setcor and the intended launch of NPS Vatsalya.Budget 2024 announced the hiking of the tax deduction limit on private sector employers’ contributions to NPS from 10% to 14% of employees’ basic salaries, bringing it at par with the provisions available for government employees.Sriram Iyer, CEO, HDFC Pension Management told ET that with this move the “ground rules have been harmonised among government and non-government employees, which is a positive step.”Effectively, this means that now, private-sector employees can choose to reduce the taxable portion of employers’ contribution to their NPS corpus, thereby paying less tax and leaving greater funds in their pension deposits.“Employees will benefit from tax savings . More importantly, the 40% increase in contribution will have a significant impact on the terminal value of the retirement corpus,” remarked Iyer. The extended savings will “help in retirement planning, working as an option that is at par with the Provident Fund,” Dinesh Rohira, CEO & Founder, 5nance.com was quoted as saying.Moreover, the endeavour aims to increase NPS penetration by increasing tax incentives for the private sector, providing them a social security-cushion post-retirement.The scheme’s motive to widen the NPS subscriber base may not prove to be flawlessly effective, however. This is explained by Agrees Mrin Agarwal, Founder, Finsafe India: “While it’s good that the limit has been raised, it may not increase adoption as employees need to be educated in a big way. Also, the benefit is only for the salaried opting for the new tax regime,” she says.The mandatory contribution to the EPF, too, threatens to relegate the provisions of NPS under the umbrella of near-superfluity. This sentiment is echoed by Varun Sahay, a software engineer in a Delhi-based IT company: “When 12% of my salary is already deducted for the EPF, why should I put in more in the NPS and cut my take-home pay?”Rohira feels otherwise. “There’s no competition between the NPS and EPF as employees can contribute to both and build a 3-4 times bigger corpus while earning 3-4% higher returns via marketlinked options in the NPS,” he counters.Also Check | New Tax Regime 2023 vs 2024 After Budget: How Much Income Tax Will Salaried Taxpayers Save & How Do New Tax Slabs Compare To Old Regime? Top 10 Points You Must Know To jumpstart retirement savings for children, a new initiative called NPS Vatsalya has been unveiled in the Budget. This scheme allows parents and guardians to contribute to a minor's account, which can be converted into a regular NPS account once the child reaches adulthood.""It provides a very long duration for reaping the compounding benefits and accumulating a huge bounty at a later age. This can be a good way to plan a better future for kids who may not opt for a service segment in the future,"" says Rohira. Sriram Iyer agrees, stating, ""It’s a good move to help the child start his retirement journey. Even if a parent starts when the child is 10 years old, by the time he starts working, it can be a solid foundation for the compounding journey after that.""However, some experts question the utility of a product with such a long lock-in period, especially when parents cannot use the funds for essential goals like their child’s education amidst soaring education costs of 11-12%.""Parents are struggling to save for their own retirement, so it might be a bit of a stretch to expect them to save for their kids’ retirement. The need of the hour is a market-linked product that allows withdrawals only for the child’s education,"" says Mrin Agarwal, Founder of Finsafe India.Also Read | Latest NPS rules 2024: How much tax will you save with new NPS contribution benefit under new regime after Budget 2024? Though the NPS permits partial withdrawals, it allows only 25% of the corpus after three years of joining, and this can be done only three times during the entire tenure. A premature exit before 60 years with 100% withdrawal is only possible if the corpus is less than Rs.2.5 lakh, an amount insufficient for most children's goals.""In its current form, there won’t be any uptake,"" asserts Agarwal. Rohira concurs, ""It’s a vanilla product with a lock-in, which does not make it very attractive and it may not take off. However, the government may optimise it and introduce new features later."" Iyer adds, ""This is just a start and there may be more subscriber-friendly features as we take it to the market. The regulator is proactive and open to feedback.""","Budget 2024 announced the hiking of the tax deduction limit on private sector employers’ contributions to NPS from 10% to 14% of employees’ basic salaries.

Gold import duty cut in Budget 2024: The recent reduction in customs duty on gold imports in the Union Budget 2024 is expected to significantly impact the gold shopping habits of Indian consumers who frequently visit Dubai. Indian jewellers with stores in both India and the UAE believe that the narrowed duty differential will result in lower gold prices in India, making it less attractive for Indians to purchase gold in Dubai.The emirate had attracted gold-enthusiast Indians following a steep rise in customs duty in India in July 2022. In the fiscal 2024-25 budget, the duty on gold imports was more than halved.The duty cut is also expected to boost gold jewellery production in India, particularly the popular 'Kolkatti' jewellery from Kolkata, which is favored by Indian expats in Dubai and tourists from various countries. This move will encourage gold artisans to create new designs in both heavyweight and lightweight jewellery, attracting consumers to purchase gold from India.According to an ET report, Joy Alukkas, chairman of Joy Alukkas Group , estimates that nearly 50% of their UAE business will shift to India as Indian tourists who previously bought jewellery in Dubai will now prefer to shop in India. However, Indian expats living in Dubai and other customers may continue to buy from the UAE.Also Read | Gold losing sheen?

Gold trade analyst Bhargav Baidya suggests that the 1% duty differential between gold jewellery in India and Dubai will be offset by Indian jewellers offering discounts to retain and attract customers.Saurabh Gadgil, chairman of PNG Jewellers, notes that Indian import duty is now on par with the US, allowing Indian jewellers to offer competitive prices compared to other countries worldwide.

He also noted that people are uncertain about the potential for further increases in gold prices in the short-to-medium term following a recent rally. Additionally, Galipelli pointed out that savings in rural areas have been impacted by retail inflation and other factors.The gold bond and gold monetisation schemes were introduced by the government in late 2015 to discourage the physical purchase of precious metals and reduce imports, thereby mitigating the negative impact on the current account deficit.The gross collection through these two schemes is now projected to be Rs 20,030 crore in 2024-25, compared to Rs 31,168 crore in the interim budget and Rs 28,240 crore (revised estimate) in the previous fiscal year. Similarly, the net collection is estimated at Rs 16,433 crore, down from Rs 27,571 crore in the interim budget and Rs 26,653 crore in the previous year. However, the estimates for the gold monetisation scheme remain unchanged from the interim budget level.Also Read | Budget 2024: Duty cuts on gold, silver, platinum, and diamonds to make jewellery more affordable The sovereign gold bond scheme targets investors who view gold as an investment, encouraging them to purchase paper gold instead of physical gold.On the other hand, the gold monetisation scheme aims to bring out idle gold held by households, temple trusts, and others to increase domestic supply. Both schemes were designed to curb gold imports, which, along with crude oil, have been significant contributors to India's current account deficit. Gold bond issuances had moderated after reaching Rs 16,049 crore during the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020-21, before experiencing a surge in 2023-24.","The government has reduced its target for issuing gold bonds in the financial year 2024-25 by 38% compared to the previous interim budget goal.

Tata Trusts' head Noel joins Tata Sons board,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/tata-trusts-head-noel-joins-tata-sons-board/articleshow/114991611.cms,"MUMBAI: Noel Tata , who became chairman of Tata Trusts after half-brother Ratan Tata 's death, has officially joined the board of Tata Sons, according to the company's website. TOI first reported Noel's upcoming appointment to the Tata Sons board in its Oct 17 edition.Noel (67) is currently the only member from the Tata Group's founding family to sit on boards of both Tata Trusts and Tata Sons. Noel's half-brother, Jimmy Tata, as well as his three children Leah, Maya, and Neville, serve on various foundation boards within Tata Trusts.Days after Noel's appointment as Trusts' chairman on Oct 11, the Trusts' boards endorsed and approved his name as their third representative on the Tata Sons board. Subsequently, Trusts forwarded their nomination request to Tata Sons. According to rules, the company's board must consider the matter within a fortnight of receiving such a request, with the deadline falling last week. Noel was inducted into the board of Tata Sons last week, within that timeframe. Venu Srinivasan and Vijay Singh serve as the other two nominees of the Trusts. Trusts hold about 66% in Tata Sons and their nominated representatives possess special voting rights.Despite his position, Noel cannot assume the chairmanship of Tata Sons, as Trusts previously established a clear distinction between the leadership roles of Tata Sons and Trusts, ensuring that no single individual leads both organisations. The Shapoorji Pallonji Group, despite holding an 18% stake in Tata Sons, lacks board representation.In 2012, Noel was considered for Tata Sons chairmanship upon Ratan Tata's retirement. However, Ratan Tata's concerns about Noel's insufficient experience led to his rejection. Subsequently, Cyrus Mistry, Noel's brother-in-law, was selected despite similar experience limitations. This arrangement ended in discord, resulting in Mistry's removal from Tata Sons in 2016. In Jan 2017, Noel was again passed over when Ratan Tata selected N Chandrasekaran, who was then heading TCS, as chairman of Tata Sons.As Trusts' chairman and Tata Sons' director, Noel will significantly influence the selection of the next Tata Sons chairman in 2028, when Chandrasekaran's tenure concludes. Tata Sons manages 30 companies across various sectors, including consumer goods, and hotels.","Noel Tata, who became chairman of Tata Trusts after half-brother Ratan Tata's death, has officially joined the board of Tata Sons.

The 2024 US election is expected to be influenced by high voter turnout and a significant increase in mail-in ballots, which could result in vote counts continuing well past election night in various states. While some states are projected to report almost all results by the next day, others may experience delays due to a combination of mail-in ballots, provisional votes, and late-arriving ballots. Each state has different counting processes and deadlines, leading to variations in early vote reporting. This is likely to cause temporary shifts in vote tallies, particularly in swing states, where initial results from mail-in ballots may favour Democratic candidates, while same-day in-person voting could show early leads for Republicans.Moreover, the need for provisional voting in certain states for voters switching from mail-in to in-person voting adds further complexity to the situation. This summary provides anticipated timelines for counting votes across states, including polling hours, the types of ballots expected to be reported first, and policies regarding the acceptance of late-arriving mail ballots.

SINGAPORE: Trading firms will deliver about 5 million barrels of Middle East crude oil to the Shanghai International Energy Exchange (INE) this month, an unusually large volume, after domestic prices rose against global benchmark Brent, trade sources said.The volume of oil to be delivered into the November contract was likely the biggest for the year, one of the sources said, as trade was mostly muted through 2024.Vitol will deliver the most crude to INE, about 3 million barrels, including about 840,000 barrels of Abu Dhabi Murban crude and 2 million barrels of Iraqi Basra Medium crude , the sources said.Private refiner Shenghong Petrochemical sold about 1 million barrels Qatar Marine crude while state Chinese firm Zhenhua Oil will deliver 1 million barrels of Basra Medium crude, they added.The companies typically do not comment on commercial trades. INE did not respond to a request for comment.Some of these trades were conducted last month after INE's November crude futures surged above ICE Brent futures, creating an arbitrage opportunity for traders who can deliver Middle East oil into INE to fetch higher prices, another source said.The price gap was as wide as $3 a barrel at one point, the source added.Brent jumped 4% on Oct. 11 on concerns that Israel may strike Iran's oil infrastructure and disrupt supplies in the Middle East, and as U.S. fuel use spiked before Hurricane Milton barrelled across Florida.The deliveries also reduced supplies held by these traders, creating space for future purchases at lower price levels, the sources said.","The volume of oil to be delivered into the November contract was likely the biggest for the year, one of the sources said.

Investors from stocks to crypto brace for US election volatility,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/investors-from-stocks-to-crypto-brace-for-us-election-volatility/articleshow/114931401.cms,"Once past the election, fundamental market flows are building up support for a rally into the end of the year.

Just before a hotly contested US election considered a toss-up, options traders across markets appear to be reducing risk and bracing for more volatility.Equity options volatility climbed through most of October even as the market’s swings were muted, in anticipation of not just the upcoming election but also earnings season and a Federal Reserve interest-rate decision. The race between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump is too close to call in the final days before the vote.Bond yields have been rising since the Fed cut rates in September, leading investors to pull back on some futures positions and add tail-risk hedges on higher rates. For the most part, currency traders are betting on wider swings, with volatility for the yuan, Mexican peso and euro increasing on uncertainty about trade and tariffs.“Positioning is pretty clean” after some general de-risking the past few weeks into the election and Fed meeting, said Stuart Kaiser, a US equity trading strategist at Citigroup Global Markets Inc. “That is good for risk/reward post election depending on result of course. Bonds seem to be moving more than stocks.”Here’s a look at how options traders are positioning across various asset classes, from equities to crypto :As expected, much of the hedging for the election has showed up at the last minute, as shorter-term options make it easier to position closer to an event. Implied volatility is running well above realized levels, with investors bracing for wider swings even as the S&P 500 Index went 29 sessions without a drop of more than 1%.“We continue to see an interest in trades around the election with a pick up in recent days,” said Daniel Kirsch, head of options at Piper Sandler & Co. “Clients who expect Donald Trump to win the election are adding exposure to financials and crypto stocks, those who are betting on a Harris win buy options on renewable-energy stocks. There’s also a pick up in hedging with traders piling into put options for the S&P 500 and QQQ ETF.”Shorter-term S&P 500 implied volatility has been running hot relative to one-month levels, as the election and Fed bump percolates through the calculation of the shorter-term measure. The Cboe VVIX Index — which measures the volatility of the VIX — is also elevated.“Currently, the options skew is steep and VIX is much higher than realized volatility,” said Zhiwei Ren, portfolio manager at Penn Mutual Asset Management. “These are signs that the market is well hedged at this point.”While volatility has been elevated, it’s pointing to about a 1.7% move for the S&P 500 the day after the election — not an outrageous swing. The implied move has fallen steadily from a peak of around 2% in early October to be about in line with the long-term average for past elections, according to Stefano Pascale, head of US equity-derivatives strategy at Barclays Plc.Beyond the general indexes, some sectors, such as crypto and clean-energy stocks, are seeing a surge in volatility well above their medians. Crypto stocks are pricing almost 10% moves, Morgan Stanley’s trading desk said last week, and those for renewable firms around 6%. That’s playing out in positioning, where, for example, more than 20,000 November call spreads were bought last week in Sunrun Inc.Once past the election, fundamental market flows are building up support for a rally into the end of the year, as hedges are taken off, mutual fund buying kicks in during November, companies repurchase shares and lower volatility draws in systemic buying and rehedging by option dealers.“Assuming a smooth post-election period, we believe these hedges may unwind and we could see a sharp drop of VIX and flatter skew,” said Ren. “If both happen, it could force more buyers into the market and push the market higher.”Short-term currency options that are now pricing in risk around the election have seen an implied volatility jump in anticipation of wider swings after the US vote. One-week dollar-yuan swings hit a record high late last week as traders hedged against the possibility of higher US tariffs that Trump has threatened and a global trade war that could especially hurt China.Volatility in the euro — also vulnerable to any trade tariffs that a victory for Trump could entail — has risen the most since 2020, reaching its highest level since March 2023, while risk reversals remain bearish on the euro versus the dollar. One-week volatility on the peso has climbed to the highest in more than four years, and its premium to expected swings further out in time widened to the highest since Bloomberg began compiling data in 2007.Positioning in the Treasuries market over the past couple of weeks has been focused toward traders de-leveraging positions in futures, skewed toward long liquidations amid rising expectations of a post-election boost to fiscal stimulus, swelling the supply of Treasuries. The result has seen open interest, or the amount of positions held by traders, drop sharply in 10-year note futures since the start of October as yields have climbed.The de-risking, or traders taking chips off the table, has also been reflected in the cash market, where the latest survey from JPMorgan Chase & Co. shows clients reducing both long and short positions, as neutrals rise. In the options market for Treasuries, tail-risk hedges sit at higher yields and a bigger bond market selloff versus current levels. The 109.50 December 10-year put is notably populated, equivalent to a yield of approximately 4.5% and around 25 basis points higher than current levels.“Election volatility premium is most pronounced in the bond market on long-end rates, which we believe reflects concerns over higher fiscal risks on a sweep outcome,” said Tanvir Sandhu, Bloomberg Intelligence’s chief global derivatives strategist. “The skew suggests demand for hedges using payer swaptions against a selloff in long-end rates.”Crypto traders are diverging on the election result, with the options market turning from aggressively bullish to a more hedge-focused approach. The implied volatility for short-term contracts such as the 14-day puts has risen significantly while calls with the same expiration remain stable, according to data compiled by crypto liquidity provider B2C2.While there is no clear directional bias with heightened volatility going into the election, increasing premium for calls across longer tenors and termed Bitcoin futures on CME point to a bullish outlook beyond the election, with more rate cuts and potential positive changes in crypto policies in sight next year.Binary options — in which a payout is triggered if a pair of conditions are met, such as a currency and a stock reaching pre-determined levels — tend to be a popular way to hedge possible outcomes around major events. Such trades have picked up going in the election, according to Esmail Afsah, a derivatives strategist at JPMorgan.“I suspect this is mainly because investors have firm views on how individual assets are likely to behave in the four key permeations of the US election,” Afsah said. “Using hybrid options and betting on the direction of two assets concurrently allows to increase leverage materially and thus improve odds, providing of course that assets do indeed behave as expected.”"," options traders across markets appear to be reducing risk and bracing for more volatility.

OMAHA: Warren Buffett is now sitting on more than USD 325 billion cash after continuing to unload billions of dollars worth of Apple and Bank of America shares this year and continuing to collect a steady stream of profits from all of Berkshire Hathaway 's assorted businesses without finding any major acquisitions. Berkshire said it sold off more Apple shares in the third quarter after halving its massive investment in the iPhone maker last quarter. The stake valued at USD 69.9 billion at the end of September remains Berkshire's biggest single investment, but it has been cut drastically since the end of last year when it was worth USD 174.3 billion.Berkshire said Saturday that investment gains again drove its third quarter profits skyward to USD 26.25 billion, or USD 18,272 per Class A share. A year ago, unrealised paper investment losses dragged the Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate's earnings down to a loss of USD 12.77 billion, or USD 8,824 per Class A share.Buffett has long recommended that investors pay more attention to Berkshire's operating earnings if they want to get a good sense of how the businesses it owns are doing because those numbers exclude investments. Berkshire's bottom-line profit figures can vary widely from quarter to quarter along with the value of its investments regardless of whether the company bought or sold anything.By that measure, Berkshire said its operating earnings were only down about 6% at USD 10.09 billion, or USD 7,023.01 per Class A share. That compares to last year's USD 10.8 billion, or USD 7,437.15 per Class A share.The four analysts surveyed by FactSet Research predicted that Berkshire would report operating earnings of USD 7,335.11 per Class A share.Berkshire's revenue didn't change much at USD 92.995 billion. A year ago, it reported USD 93.21 billion revenue. That number was ahead of the USD 92.231 billion revenue that three analysts surveyed by FactSet predicted.Berkshire owns an assortment of insurance businesses, including Geico, along with BNSF railroad, several major utilities and a varied collection of retail and manufacturing businesses, including brands like Dairy Queen and See's Candy.",Berkshire Hathaway is now sitting on more than USD 325 billion cash after continuing to unload billions of dollars worth of Apple and Bank of America shares this year.

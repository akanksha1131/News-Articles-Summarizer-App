Stock market today: Nifty50 and BSE Sensex , the Indian equity benchmark indices, opened flat in trade on Tuesday. While Nifty50 was near 24,700, BSE Sensex was hovering near 80,900. At 9:19 AM, Nifty50 was trading at 24,690.05, up 9 points or 0.037%. BSE Sensex was at 80,885.66, down 5 points of 0.0066%.Market experts anticipate continued pressure due to varied Q1 results, ongoing FII outflows and stalled progress in India-US trade negotiations as the deadline approaches.VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Investments Limited says, “There are more headwinds than tailwinds for the market now. The major issue weighing on markets is that the expected trade deal between India and the US has not happened so far and the probability of a deal before the August 1 deadline is becoming lower. President Trump’s success in reaching deals with Japan and EU, which were advantageous for the US, may further make the US position harder on deal with India. It remains to be seen what transpires before August 1st deadline.”“Further more, there are threats of more tariffs on countries that trade with Russia if Russia doesn’t reach a deal with Ukraine on stopping the war. The threat of tariffs on pharmaceuticals is another concern.President Trump, having tasted blood in deals so far, is likely to act tough, going forward. This is a concern. Sustained FII selling is impacting the market despite the DII buying. It is better to remain in a wait and watch mode.

Donald Trump Threatens 10% Tariff on 'Little' BRICS: India Among Nations Warned of 'Very Quick End'

US President Donald Trump ’s reciprocal tariff deadline for August 1, 2025 will not be extended, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has said. According to an AFP report, Lutnick said that the new set of tariffs will hit countries effective August 1.""So no extensions, no more grace periods. August 1, the tariffs are set. They'll go into place. Customs will start collecting the money, and off we go,"" Lutnick said during his appearance on ""Fox News Sunday”, according to the AFP report.The earlier deadline of July 9 had been extended to August 1 by Trump. In the last few weeks, the US has sealed trade deals with several countries including the UK, Japan, Indonesia, Philippines.Trump has been on a tariff letter sending spree since earlier this month. He is also planning to impose tariffs of 10-15% on smaller countries.Meanwhile, Trump is meeting European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen on Sunday, pausing his golf activities in Scotland to engage in trade discussions. Both parties are seeking a tariff agreement as the White House's deadline for implementing substantial import duties approaches this week.Trump has consistently warned most nations with hefty tariffs, aiming to reduce significant US trade deficits with major trading partners, including the European Union.Trump recently said ""we have a 50-50 chance, maybe less than that, but a 50-50 chance of making a deal with the EU."" He additionally indicated that any agreement would need to ""buy down"" the currently planned 30% tariff rate on the 27-nation bloc.Despite appearing close to reaching an agreement earlier this month, Trump opted to propose a 30% tariff rate.The EU has indicated its readiness to respond with reciprocal tariffs on numerous American goods, including beef, automotive components, beer and Boeing aircraft, should no agreement be reached.","US President Donald Trump’s reciprocal tariff deadline for August 1, 2025 will not be extended.

"TCS's 12,000 job cuts spark fears of larger IT layoffs",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/tcss-12000-job-cuts-spark-fears-of-larger-it-layoffs/articleshow/122964897.cms,"Representative image

Margin Pressures:

Bench Policy:

Sudden Exits:

Campus Chaos:

BENGALURU: TCS laying off over 12,000 mid- and senior-level employees has sent shockwaves across the tech industry. This move not just challenges the perception of TCS as a company known for job security and stability, but shows that India's IT sector is in the early stages of a significant reset. The industry is undergoing a structural shift, mirroring global trends where major tech firms are streamlining resources, improving cost efficiency, reallocating assets, and shutting down divisions that no longer align with strategic priorities.Industry experts attribute this transformation to mounting margin pressures, prompting companies to control costs by reducing headcount. Many believe that AI is disrupting the traditional workforce pyramid, replacing broad-based hiring models with leaner, more specialised structures which yield higher billing. As a result, the future of services will rely heavily on a blend of newer tech and human ingenuity, where billability is determined by the premium clients are willing to pay for niche skills rather than volume of resources.TCS has said its restructuring efforts are aimed at making the company future-ready. As part of this initiative, sources told TOI the company has begun focusing on employees who have remained unbilled - commonly referred to as being on the ""bench"" - for extended periods, typically ranging from 3 to 18 months.These individuals, many of whom have between 3 and 10 years of experience with the firm, are being either relocated or let go. This has sparked concerns within the industry over the potential for a wave of sudden and unexpected exits.Several employees who spoke to TOI on condition of anonymity said those impacted had been on the bench for anywhere between 3 and 18 months. In one case, an employee claimed she was called into a meeting where three HR representatives handed her a ""discharge letter"" and asked her to resign. ""It was sudden and shocking. There was no prior intimation,"" she said. TCS, however, maintains that it has consistently offered relocation and retraining options to benched employees to enhance their chances of being deployed on projects.Meanwhile, lateral hires awaiting onboarding have reported uncertainty. In response to one such candidate, a TCS HR executive reportedly said, ""Do not wait for TCS. New announcements are going on. We are helpless,"" suggesting that onboarding timelines are unclear amid ongoing changes.Indian campuses are facing a stark dichotomy - freshers without job offers on one side, and large salary packages on the other. The recent layoffs at TCS have sounded an alarm across the industry. Global capability centres (GCCs) continue to lead recruitment efforts as Indian IT companies adapt to a major transformation in the tech landscape.Even as upskilling becomes part of everyday work life, lower net additions are making engineering graduates anxious. Indian campuses today present a stark contrast: while some students receive lucrative offers, many others are left without any. For computer science students, the future is deeply intertwined with AI, offering exciting opportunities but also demanding rapid adaptation.Ramkumar Ramamoorthy, partner at tech growth advisory firm Catalincs, said, ""In the context of digital and AI, there is a crying need for India to reimagine its higher education to stay relevant. Beyond STEM programmes, we must integrate AI across disciplines - liberal arts, law, medicine, management, and social sciences. The only way to do this at scale is through collaboration with experts and practitioners. Otherwise, we risk producing graduates who are misaligned with market needs, potentially leading to serious social implications. ""","TCS has said its restructuring efforts are aimed at making the company future- ready. As part of this initiative, sources told TOI the company has begun focusing on employees who have remained unbilled for extended periods. This has sparked concerns within the industry over the potential for a wave of sudden exits.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122964922,imgsize-33324,width-400,resizemode-4/122964922.jpg"

Global Trends of Layoffs

TCS layoffs have sent shockwaves in India’s IT sector - the decision by India’s largest IT services firm to cut 2% of its workforce has laid bare the increased environment of uncertainty that the IT sector is currently facing. Tata Consultancy Services or TCS announced on Sunday its intent to sack over 12,000 employees - a number never seen before in India’s IT sector.This unprecedented workforce downsizing in the IT sector highlights the challenging market conditions, particularly without substantial contracts such as BSNL. Analysts interpret this development as a harbinger of industry-wide changes, where increased automation implementation and profit margin constraints compel organisations to lower their personnel expenses.According to the statement released by TCS, the layoffs will impact people in the middle to senior level positions.""TCS is on a journey to become a Future-Ready organisation. This includes strategic initiatives on multiple fronts, including investing in new-tech areas, entering new markets, deploying AI at scale for our clients and ourselves, deepening our partnerships, creating next-gen infrastructure, and realigning our workforce model,” the company said.""Towards this, a number of reskilling and redeployment initiatives have been underway. As part of this journey, we will also be releasing associates from the organisation whose deployment may not be feasible. This will impact about 2 per cent of our global workforce, primarily in the middle and the senior grades, over the course of the year,"" it added.TCS CEO K Krithivasan has called the move to lay off over 12,000 employees a ‘difficult’ one. In an interview with Moneycontrol, K Krithivasan said, “It’s a difficult call we have to take to build a stronger TCS.” He also said that the IT company aims to make the process as compassionate as possible.TCS has said that the employees who will be asked to leave will receive comprehensive support, including outplacement services, counselling assistance, and appropriate benefits. The company will provide severance packages and notice period compensation to the staff members who are impacted.The organisation will also extend insurance coverage and offer career transition support to the affected workforce.The company's statement reads: ""We understand that this is a challenging time for our colleagues likely to be affected. We thank them for their service and we will be making all efforts to provide appropriate benefits, outplacement, counselling, and support as they transition to new opportunities.""Employee unions in the IT sector have termed the sackings as illegal and urged TCS workers facing job cuts to stand firm against resignation pressures. The Karnataka State IT/ITeS Employees Union has called upon the industry giant to revoke the workforce reduction plans and reinstate affected personnel.The Forum for IT Employees (FITE) suggested that TCS should refrain from exerting direct pressure on staff members to resign, and instead offer notice period compensation, separation packages and health insurance coverage for one year.Also Read | ‘Don’t resign under pressure….’: TCS layoffs opposed by IT employee unions; IT giant to sack 12,000 employees FITE emphasised that TCS maintains strong financial health and these redundancies during steady business conditions are solely driven by profit considerations. The organisation counselled TCS employees to keep detailed documentation, resist voluntary exits and reach out to either the State Labour Commissioner or FITE if faced with departure pressure, an ET report said.NITES has written to labour minister Mansukh Mandaviya asking for the terminations to be 'halted' for now.K Krithivasan told Moneycontrol that the layoffs are not linked to efficiency improvements from artificial intelligence implementation. He said that the decision to reduce the workforce stems from skill mismatches.""This is not because of AI giving some 20 percent productivity gains. We are not doing that. This is driven by where there is a skill mismatch, or, where we think that we have not been able to deploy someone,” he was quoted as saying.TCS has said the process of transition and layoffs over the year is being planned in a way so as to ensure no disruption in client deliverables. “This transition is being planned with due care to ensure there is no impact on service delivery to our clients,” TCS said.This will be the largest layoff for TCS in its history. In 2015, the IT firm had laid off around 3,000 people, which at that time was around 1% of its workforce.An ET report says that this the biggest ever mass layoff for the Indian IT sector till date.Also Read | TCS layoffs: What will Tata Consultancy Services do for 12,000 employees it will let go this year? What the IT giant said According to an ET report, TCS has not provided any additional details regarding the calculation of the 2% reduction, the implementation process for the staff reductions, or whether additional rounds of job cuts would follow in subsequent periods.The Indian IT sector is facing unprecedented job cuts, mirroring practices commonly seen in US companies, causing widespread concern throughout the industry. The combination of global economic uncertainties and disruptions caused by artificial intelligence technology continues to affect business demand.Based on the data from Layoffs.fyi, a platform monitoring global tech industry redundancies, more than 80,000 technology sector employees have lost their jobs across 169 companies in 2025.2024, witnessed approximately 150,000 job losses spanning 551 technology firms. These figures reflect both worldwide economic challenges and ongoing discussions within the technology sector regarding artificial intelligence's influence on employment opportunities and workforce requirements.Microsoft, currently ranked as the world's second most valuable listed company after Nvidia, has dismissed over 15,000 staff members in 2025, which is 7% of its worldwide staff count.Also Read | TCS layoffs: 12,000 employees to lose their jobs; Tata Consultancy Services plans 2% workforce cut over the year - what you should know","Tata Consultancy Services or TCS announced on Sunday its intent to sack over 12,000 employees.

Tech Rally Drives Momentum

Commodities and currency moves

Asian markets broadly declined on Tuesday, as initial optimism surrounding newly proposed trade agreements with Japan and the European Union by US President Donald Trump began to fade.Japan’s Nikkei 225 slipped nearly 0.7 per cent to 40,725.23, while Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 edged down 0.3 per cent to 8,670.50. South Korea’s Kospi managed to recover from earlier losses, ending flat with a marginal gain of less than 0.1 per cent at 3,212.59.In China, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index dropped 1.1 per cent to 25,276.36, and the Shanghai Composite fell 0.3 per cent to 3,586.93.Analysts said investors turned cautious as attention shifted to ongoing trade discussions between the US and China. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent met with Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng in Sweden, though no major breakthroughs were reported. Bessent suggested that existing tariff levels would likely remain in place.“Aside from addressing economic imbalances, tariffs are also now well entrenched in the geo-political arena,” said Tan Boon Heng of Mizuho Bank’s Asia & Oceania Treasury Department.Trump recently unveiled a new trade framework with Japan, proposing a 15 per cent import tax- lower than the previously floated 25 per cent. Under the deal, Japan agreed to invest $550 billion in the US and expand access to its automotive and rice markets, though finer details are still pending.Meanwhile, the US and the EU struck a deal to impose 15 per cent tariffs on cars and other goods, again lower than earlier threats. Despite the announcements, many trade details remain unresolved, keeping investors on edge. US markets ended Monday relatively stable, with investors awaiting the Federal Reserve’s upcoming interest rate decision on Wednesday. Wall Street broadly expects the Fed to delay any rate cuts until September, although some Trump-appointed officials could dissent. The Fed has held rates steady throughout 2025 following a series of reductions late last year.Technology and AI-linked stocks continued to lead the market. Tesla shares jumped 3 per cent after it announced a potential $16.5 billion semiconductor deal with Samsung Electronics. Samsung's stock in Seoul surged 6.8 per cent.Chipmakers saw broad gains following Alphabet’s announcement of an $85 billion investment in AI chips and related initiatives. Advanced Micro Devices climbed 4.3 per cent, while Super Micro Computer surged 10.2 per cent.However, not all earnings updates impressed. Revvity shares plunged 8.3 per cent despite beating quarterly earnings expectations, as its full-year forecast fell short of analyst estimates. The result weighed on broader sentiment.Investors are watching closely as nearly one-third of S&P 500 companies are due to report quarterly results this week. Strong earnings are seen as critical to justifying recent stock rallies, which have been partly fuelled by tariff relief hopes. Some analysts, however, remain sceptical about elevated valuations without corresponding profit growth.In energy markets, US crude edged up by 1 cent to $66.72 per barrel, while Brent crude added 6 cents to $70.10.On the currency front, the US dollar strengthened slightly to 148.56 Japanese yen from 148.54 yen. The euro ticked up to $1.1600 from $1.1593.","Japan’s Nikkei 225 slipped nearly 0.7 per cent to 40,725.23, while Australia's S&P/ASX 200 edged down 0.3 per cent.

Morgan Stanley maintained its overweight rating on Kotak Mahindra Bank but cut target price to Rs 2,600 from Rs 2,650 earlier. Analysts said that the April-June quarter was a soft quarter for the bank in a tough macro environment. While growth was stronger than the sector’s, net interest margin (NIM) decline and non-performing loan (NPL) formation were higher than expected. They expect the current quarter to remain tough due to further margin decline. They also expect earnings to accelerate thereafter, led by lagged repricing of deposits, cash reserve ratio (CRR) cut benefits, and improvement in loan mix.Jefferies maintained its hold rating on Cipla with the price target hiked to Rs 1,690 from Rs 1,610. Analysts said during April-June quarter, Cipla’s key markets disappointed and they expect new drug launches in the US to start reflecting from the first half of FY27. It also showed a tepid growth in the Indian market. The numbers in the US market were lower than expected but were offset by strong sales in the rest of the world markets and higher other income. Analysts expect the US sales could reach $1 billion in FY27 or after.Nuvama has a hold rating on IDFC First Bank with the target price at Rs 68. Analysts said that in the April-June quarter the lender reduced stress in its micro-finance (MFI) portfolio with lower slippages and special mention accounts during the same period. However, they said that the bank’s overall slippages went up due to a Rs 108 crore slippage from an ATM service provider which has been fully provided for and an uptick in other non-MFI slippages. Analysts feel IDFC First Bank’s growth momentum remains ahead of peers.Macquarie maintained its outperform rating on Titan with the target price at Rs 4,150. Analysts said they liked the strong brand position of Damas and large growth headroom in the UAE and Kuwait. They also have a positive view of the company’s ability to experiment and learn lab grown diamonds/premium designs through Damas. They are also positive on the stock after the company clarified about no further acquisitions in international geographies in the near term. However, they were negative on the company’s slower-than-expected path to EPS (earnings per share) accretion.Citigroup has a buy on Bank of Baroda with the target price at Rs 310. Analysts said that the lender’s April-June net profit of Rs 4,540 crore was in line with their estimates. They said that only 7 bais points NIM decline and Rs 1,880 crore of treasury gains neutralized higher credit cost at 66 basis points and modest fee growth. They expect FY26 NIMs to settle near April-June level and build higher credit over FY26-27.","Morgan Stanley maintained its overweight rating on Kotak Mahindra Bank but cut target price to Rs 2,600.

That won’t affect telecom services.”However, considering that the company’s global customer footprint is to the tune of 50 lakh users, the Indian number will still be highly significant for the company if it hits peak. Satcom services are expected to target rural and remote areas, where BSNL is known to have a significant presence.A govt official mentioned that the limit on Starlink connections will be due to its existing network capacity. Starlink has a lowearth orbit constellation of 4,408 satellites, which orbit the earth at a distance of about 540-570 km. It is expected to have a 600 Gbps throughput over India. The company’s authorisation is valid for five years or until constellation end.After receiving a satcom licence from DoT and satellite authorisation from INSPACe, Starlink will now begin to build ground infrastructure. It is planning to import equipment for which it will approach DoT for permissions.","The company is likely to opt for a monthly consumer broadband plan that may cost around Rs 3,000.

AHMEDABAD: Eight-month-old Dhyaansh is all smiles today, his rosy cheeks glowing as he grins widely. After receiving skin grafts on his face, head and hands from his mother, Manisha, 30, the infant has recovered from what could have been fatal injuries. The son and wife of Dr Kapil Kachhadiya, a urology resident at Civil Hospital, were recently discharged from a city hospital after five weeks of treatment for severe burns they suffered in the aftermath of the AI 171 airplane crash on June 12.The mother-son duo was in the BJ Medical College hostel and residential quarters in Meghaninagar when the tragedy unfolded.Everything went black for a moment and then heat engulfed their residence. Manisha grabbed Dhyaansh and ran from the building through thick smoke and flames that made it nearly impossible for her to see anything. The hot air left the mother and child with serious burns. ""There was a moment I thought we would not make it out. But I had to, for my child. We have both been through pain I cannot put into words,"" Manisha said.While Manisha suffered 25% burns, affecting her hands and face, eight-month-old Dhyaansh's condition was worse with 36% burns on his face, both arms, abdomen and chest.The duo was shifted to KD Hospital for treatment where Dhyaansh was immediately admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). He needed a ventilator to breathe, fluid resuscitation, blood transfusion care and specialised treatment for burns.Dr Adit Desai, managing director of KD Hospital, said the case moved everyone involved. ""It was deeply touching because of the mother's instinctive courage to save her child. From a medical standpoint, every department came together to ensure the best possible outcome.""Dr Desai added that the hospital provided free treatment to six patients who were affected by the AI 171 airplane crash.Dr Rutvij Parikh, plastic surgeon at KD Hospital, said that the child's own skin and mother's skin grafts were used to treat the burn wounds. ""The patient's age was a major factor. We had to make sure the wounds did not get infected and that his growth would be normal. The recovery of the child and mother has been satisfactory.""""Dr Kapil's involvement as a father helped enormously. As a medical professional himself, he often made sure the dressings were done properly, even in the middle of the night,"" he added.The treatment involved several specialists: Dr Snehal Patel, neonatologist and pediatrician; Dr Tushar Patel, pulmonologist and critical care specialist; and Dr Mansi Dandnaik, critical care and transplant intensivist.Dr Snehal Patel described a serious complication that Dhyaansh faced. ""Due to the incident, blood rushed into one side of the child's lungs. He was kept on ventilatory support, and an intercostal drainage tube was inserted until we achieved good lung expansion.""","Dhyaansh Kachhadiya, 8 months, and his mother, Manisha, 30, suffered severe burns after the AI 171 crash on June 12.

Motorists fume as Telangana RTA drives up service charges,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/motorists-fume-as-telangana-rta-drives-up-service-charges/articleshow/122939847.cms,"10k applicants to be impacted

Move to increase revenue: RTA





HYDERABAD: Applicants attempting to book slots for various transactions at the Regional Transport Authority (RTA) woke up to a rude shock on Sunday as they found a sudden increase in charges across several services. The revision came into effect at 2 am.The new rate-card shows that RTA has revised fees anywhere from Rs 100 to Rs 1,000 — with a fourfold jump in rates for a no-objection certificate (NOC). Available for Rs 100 until now, every NOC will now cost a motorist Rs 435. The cost for terminating vehicle agreements for four-wheelers has also been substantially increased from Rs 2,135 to Rs 3,135. Even commonly availed costs, right from learners’ licence to vehicle hypothecation, have been brought under the new price umbrella. Motorists applying for any licence will have to cough up an additional Rs 100.The only exemptions: Permits, vehicle fitness assessments, taxes on vehicles from other states, permit cancellations, life taxes, and quarterly taxes.This revision — brought in three years after a hike on life taxes — is likely to impact at least 10,000 daily applicants at all RTA offices across the state. In 2022, the Telangana govt had raised life taxes under the Telangana Motor Vehicles Taxation Act, 1963, with increases ranging from 9% to 19% based on vehicle cost and category.Many applicants, while ruing the sharp rise, also complained about the current revision being implemented surreptitiously without prior public announcement or notification. In fact, the RTA website: www.transport.telangana.gov.in is yet to be updated with these new charges.Speaking to TOI, some said that they realised that the fees had been hiked only when they went to their RTA office to avail of a service.“I tried to secure a learner’s licence slot two days ago, when the fee displayed was Rs 450. However, I encountered technical issues and couldn’t complete the booking. When I tried again on Sunday, I was surprised to see that the total amount had risen to Rs 550, with the service charge component having increased from Rs 100 to Rs 200,” said K Venkatesh, an applicant from Uppal.RTA officials said that the revision was aimed at enhancing revenue. “Only service charges, which have remained unchanged for several years, have been increased. However, we need to monitor the situation for at least one month to assess how these increased charges contribute to revenue enhancement,” MM Chandrasekhar Goud, joint transport commissioner (IT & Vigilance), told TOI.Sources, on the other hand, hinted at the move being designed to accommodate tax exemptions being offered to EV buyers. Incidentally, since the Telangana govt implemented its EV policy on Nov 16, 2024, Rs 400 crore (approx) tax has been exempted through sales of more than 50,000 EVs.“The govt’s actions are unfair, as they offer complete tax relief to electric vehicles while parallelly raising service charges,” said M Dayanand, general secretary, Telangana Auto and Motor Welfare Union.“The facilities at their offices lack essential amenities for the public, and applicants are forced to wait in long queues for their turn. It is disappointing that despite these ongoing service deficiencies, the RTA has implemented increased service charges. I urge the govt authorities to reinstate the previous fee structure, in the interest of the public.”","Regional Transport Authority revises fees anywhere from Rs 100 to Rs 1,000.

CHANDIGARH: The special cell of Delhi Police has made another arrest in connection with the April 7 RPG attack at Qila Lal Singh police station in Punjab's Batala, nabbing 22-year-old Karanbir alias Karan from Gurdaspur in an Arms Act case registered at the special cell police station.An officer said he had confessed to his involvement in the rocket-propelled grenade (RPG) attack, which traces its roots to masterminds and handlers in the US, Greece, and Armenia. Karan, according to the special cell of Delhi Police, has allegiance with the banned terror group Babbar Khalsa International (BKI). His arrest came four days after another accused and alleged BKI operative, Akashdeep Singh alias Baaz (22), was arrested by the special cell from Indore on April 22.Both are residents of Chananke village in Amritsar district. Karan is the brother of Gursewak, who was among those already arrested by Punjab Police, an officer privy to the case details revealed.The Delhi Police officer said Karan spent three months in Armenia in 2024. He is accused of providing shelter to the perpetrators of the Qila Lal Singh police station attack and receiving funds sent by the handlers for the attack.The officer also said two-three shooters of this syndicate have fled to Armenia, where one of the key components of this syndicate is based. The officer said Karan was also involved in other criminal activities carried out by the syndicate.Delhi additional commissioner of police Pramod Singh Kushwah said over the phone that after the arrest of Akashdeep from Indore, they learnt about Karanbir's involvement in the Qila Lal Singh police station attack case. ""He was arrested in Gurdaspur on Sunday. He was part of the conspiracy and played a key role in the grenade attack,"" Kushwah said.The RPG attack case was initially probed by Punjab Police before it was handed over to the National Investigation Agency (NIA) earlier this month. The special cell of Delhi Police had also started working on the BKI module allegedly involved in the attack after United States-based Happy Passia (arrested by the FBI in the US on April 17), Manu Agwan (who police believe is in Greece), and Gopi Nawanshahria (who police suspect to be in North America) claimed responsibility and threatened to carry out an attack in Delhi as well.Among others, Punjab Police have named Armenia-based Shamsher Singh aka Shera aka Honey as an accused in the Qila Lal Singh police station attack. According to Punjab Police, the associates of Shera were responsible for the retrieval and disposal of the RPG under his directions in the attack.Batala senior superintendent of police Suhail Qasim Mir said before giving the case to NIA, Punjab Police arrested a dozen accused, and Gursewak was one of them. ""Armenia-based Shamsher Singh Shera is one of the accused,"" he said.Closely linked to now-arrested Happy Passia and Pakistani-based BKI terrorist Harwinder Singh Rinda, Shera, as per a police dossier, is described as a foreign-based active node of the Rinda-Passia terror network. The dossier reads, ""He plays a key role in supporting the terror network by providing manpower, logistics, and financial aid for their nefarious activities."" Shera is wanted by Punjab Police in FIRs linked to terrorism, organised crime, and anti-national acts, reads the dossier.Shera, a native of village Mann in Gurdaspur district, according to the police dossier, facilitated the targeted killing of Hardeep Singh, a resident of Jouria Kalan, Batala. He also tasked his local associates, Kuldeep Singh and Avtar Singh of Jalandhar, with carrying out target killings in the Ludhiana area.

Boeing’s Recent Troubles

Boeing New Order Book

Trump’s Role Overstated?

US President Donald Trump’s trade war seems to be benefitting one aviation sector giant in America - Boeing! As Trump seals trade deals with countries around the world, he is also bringing in deals, and Boeing is reaping the rewards.Boeing is bagging new orders through these trade deals which could prove advantageous for the company as it recovers from recent difficulties, according to a New York Times report. Additionally, these deals enable Trump to demonstrate the effectiveness of his distinctive trade strategies in supporting American industry.The US aerospace giant has globally been in the news for all the wrong reasons - the biggest being the recent crash of Air India ’s AI-171 aircraft which was a Boeing 787 Dreamliner. Investigations on the cause of the crash, which killed all but onboard, are ongoing.Additionally, Boeing faces critical challenges before it can convert its new orders into revenue. The manufacturer lags significantly in obtaining regulatory clearance for key aircraft models, including both the smallest and largest versions of the 737 Max, as well as the 777-9, which initiated FAA certification test flights twelve months ago.Boeing's operational difficulties have created significant setbacks. Following two tragic crashes, its bestselling 737 Max was suspended from service for approximately 24 months.A recent Reuters report quoted FAA Administrator Bryan Bedford saying that Boeing hasn't requested the removal of the 38-plane monthly production limit for 737 MAX aircraft. The agency will conduct a thorough assessment of the manufacturer's supply chain before reaching any conclusions.The production restriction was established by the FAA following a January 2024 incident where an Alaska Airlines 737 MAX 9 aircraft experienced an emergency situation mid-flight due to missing crucial bolts.In June this year, The National Transportation Safety Board issued a stern critique regarding Boeing's inadequate safety measures, which led to the cabin panel blowout incident on a 737 MAX 9 aircraft in January 2024. The incident triggered a significant crisis for the aircraft manufacturer.According to a Reuters report, the safety board delivered a scathing assessment of Boeing's safety protocols and highlighted the company's oversight failure in installing four crucial bolts during the production of an Alaska Airlines MAX 9.Meanwhile, Boeing's suppliers may face financial strain due to Trump's imposed tariffs, whilst potential retaliatory measures from trading partners, particularly the European Union, could adversely affect the aircraft manufacturer's business.Industry experts suggest that the trade agreements could lead to additional orders, as potential buyers might feel compelled to secure their positions now to avoid future delays. Aircraft ordered at present will be delivered in subsequent years.Recent announcements include orders for numerous Boeing aircraft from Indonesia and Japan this month, following earlier agreements with Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Qatar.However, aviation industry experts express doubt about the necessity of US trade negotiators' intervention in securing Boeing aircraft orders. The procurement of aircraft involves meticulous planning by airlines, including state-owned carriers, spanning several months to years. The limited choice between Boeing and Airbus, the sole manufacturers of large commercial aircraft, further influences purchasing decisions.Nevertheless, analysts acknowledge the strategic emphasis placed by Trump's administration on Boeing contracts within trade agreements. This focus aligns with Boeing's significant role as a major American employer and prominent export contributor.The financial markets have responded positively to the new order announcements, with Boeing's stock value showing consistent growth since April, coinciding with Trump's introduction of tariffs.The company's CEO Kelly Ortberg accompanied Trump during his Middle East visit in May when the Qatar agreement was disclosed.""If the president of the country says, 'Come with me and be certain that we sign something big that says there will be many jobs in the US,' what will you do?"" said Adam Pilarski, president of Avitas, an aviation consulting firm, according to the New York Times report.However, Pilarski and additional industry specialists advised that these orders might not be as significant as they appeared.The specifics of these agreements remain largely undisclosed, indicating ongoing complex discussions between the aircraft manufacturer and various airlines.A case in point from this month shows Trump's announcement of Indonesia's commitment to 50 Boeing aircraft, whilst an Indonesian official later clarified that negotiations were still ongoing between Garuda, their state carrier, and Boeing.""I suspect these orders are, as we used to joke at air shows, MOUTHLs — memoranda of understanding to have lunch,"" said Richard Aboulafia, a managing director at AeroDynamic Advisory, a consulting firm. ""The real hard work of contract negotiation and finance package negotiation takes place after the president's plane has left the country,” he said according to the New York Times report.Industry analysts suggest that many of these orders would likely have materialised regardless of Trump's involvement. In May, Qatar Airways, a significant international carrier, confirmed a substantial order of 150 Boeing wide-body aircraft. This particular announcement was notably comprehensive in its details.Whilst political influence may drive some orders, circumstances can shift substantially before aircraft delivery. Both Boeing and Airbus maintain extensive order books spanning multiple years of manufacturing.Airlines retain the option to withdraw from agreements, albeit potentially losing deposits. Additionally, carriers can request delivery postponements or order reductions. Manufacturers might accommodate such adjustments, particularly if it enables them to redirect aircraft to other airlines with urgent requirements for new aircraft.","US President Donald Trump’s trade war seems to be benefitting one aviation sector giant in America - Boeing.

In a high-stakes, hastily arranged meeting at President Donald Trump’s golf resort in Turnberry, Scotland, Trump and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced a trade deal that will impose a 15% baseline tariff on most EU goods entering the US: a compromise designed to stave off Trump’s threatened 30% tariff if no agreement had been reached by August 1.Trump hailed the agreement as “the biggest-ever,” while von der Leyen called it “the best we could get.” But behind the triumphant rhetoric lies a deal many in Brussels quietly acknowledge as a strategic retreat.The deal, struck in under an hour, came after months of threats, stalled talks, and tariff escalations that rattled European markets and unnerved EU leaders. According to CNN, the US president had threatened tariffs as high as 50%, pushing the EU to the negotiating table under mounting economic pressure and fears of NATO destabilisation.Trump’s administration insisted on a 15% blanket tariff, covering cars, semiconductors, pharmaceuticals, and more. Although von der Leyen claimed some strategic products such as aircraft, select chemicals, and agricultural goods would see zero tariffs, many sectors remain exposed. The AP reported that energy and defence purchases sweetened the deal — with the EU agreeing to spend $750 billion on US energy and invest a further $600 billion in American industries.Yet steel and aluminium will still be hit with 50% tariffs. Trump was blunt: “Steel stays the way it is.” Von der Leyen maintained that a quota system would eventually moderate those terms, but no final text has been released.EU countries must now ratify the agreement. Ireland said it “regrets” the baseline tariff, and Germany’s powerful BDI industry group warned of “considerable negative repercussions.” The VCI chemicals association simply called the tariffs “too high.” As CNN noted, while markets responded positively with the Dow rising 0.3% few in Europe are celebrating.Multiple reports, including from Financial Times and BBC, paint a picture of a bloc outmanoeuvred. Trump’s early-April “Liberation Day” tariffs sent markets reeling, forcing Brussels to suspend retaliation and enter talks under duress. FT reported that EU diplomats believe the bloc’s fragmented stance — especially Germany’s desire to shield its car industry — prevented a stronger response.One EU diplomat told FT, “He’s the bully in the schoolyard and we didn’t join others in standing up to him.” Former Commission negotiator Georg Riekeles said the EU “would have been better off answering the US vigorously in April in a one-two combo with China.”The Commission had originally drawn up a strategy to offer purchases and tariff reductions. But the Trump administration moved faster, levying 25% tariffs on steel, aluminium, and vehicles. Meanwhile, internal divisions saw some states pushing for tough retaliation and others urging caution. Irish Trade Minister Simon Harris was reportedly a vocal advocate for protecting Irish pharmaceuticals and spirits, according to FT.The Trump camp saw opportunity in these divisions. He rejected a July proposal for a 10% “reciprocal” tariff, demanding instead 15% across the board. As BBC pointed out, Trump viewed the EU as exploiting US openness while restricting access to its own markets — a sentiment echoed by his claim that the union was “nastier than China.”The final deal delivers predictability and avoids escalation — but at a cost. Most European exports now face higher tariffs than under the previous regime, where the US average was around 1.6%, FT found. The 15% rate, while lower than Trump’s threats, is still a substantial barrier and could erode the EU’s export competitiveness.Car manufacturers are particularly exposed. Volkswagen has already taken a $1.5 billion hit this year, and Mercedes-Benz warned of “significant increases” in US prices. While Trump said pharmaceuticals were not part of the deal, von der Leyen later insisted they were “on a separate sheet of paper” — hinting at continuing negotiations.Still, there’s relief that a deeper trade war was averted. BBC noted that Brussels’ chief concern was avoiding Trump’s wrath spilling over into security cooperation, especially in Eastern Europe and Ukraine. The EU is now betting that stability is worth the compromise.In Trump’s words: “This was the big one.” For von der Leyen and EU officials, the deal may mark not a victory, but the moment the US president “worked out exactly where our pain threshold is.”","The United States and the European Union have averted a full-scale trade war, but the price of peace is steep.

Donald Trump tariffs: Which countries have made trade deals & which are still waiting?

EU secures relief, others still in talks



South Korea under pressure after Japan’s success



Taiwan working ‘almost 24 hours’ to seal deal



No clear path for Canada and Mexico



Brazil faces political hurdle



With a couple of days left before a major tariff hike kicks in, the US is in a flurry of trade negotiations with several key economies aiming to avoid steep new duties.The new US tariffs are set to take effect on August 1 after being delayed twice. Some will go from 10% up to 50%, based on how much a country sells to the US. Donald Trump has repeatedly vowed to protect the ‘dominance of the dollar’ in his speeches, while mocking the Brics group on July 19.Over the past week, Washington has made agreements with the European Union, Britain, Japan, Vietnam, Indonesia and the Philippines. Other negotiations remain in their final stages.Commerce minister Piyush Goyal said Thursday he was “optimistic” about reaching an agreement to avoid a 26 per cent duty.Goyal said there were “not any sticking points” in trade talks and clarified that H-1B visa rules had not come up, according to Bloomberg Television.On Sunday, the US and the European Union signed a new deal that limits tariff levels on European exports to 15 per cent. This duty is far lower than the 30 per cent previously threatened by US President Donald Trump. Meanwhile, attention has shifted to nations still on the edge of Trump’s tariff regime.Seoul is scrambling to reach its own deal with Washington after Tokyo secured an agreement.“Japan's success has amped up the pressure for South Korea,” a government source was quoted as saying to news agency AFP.Seoul may offer more than $100 billion in investment, possibly involving tech giants like Samsung and Hyundai, according to a report cited by AFP. The government has not confirmed this, but officials have highlighted proposals to boost cooperation in areas such as shipbuilding, semiconductors and batteries.National security advisor Wi Sung-lak said talks are now in “the final and most crucial phase of negotiations” to stop the proposed 25 per cent tariffs.Taiwanese officials are also racing against the clock. Premier Cho Jung-tai confirmed that his team is “working hard” to protect the island’s economic interests. vice president Hsiao Bi-khim added that negotiators were “working almost 24 hours a day to achieve trade balance and Taiwan's industrial interests.”Canada and Mexico were initially exempt from Trump’s April tariffs but still face duties outside their North American trade pact. Mexico’s rate could rise to 30 per cent on August 1, while Canada may see a jump to 35 per cent. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said she is prepared to speak directly with Trump to avert the hike. However, Trump said on Friday, “there was no deal with Canada so far.”Brazil may be hit hardest, with the US threatening a 50 per cent tariff on goods including planes and grain. Though the US holds a trade surplus with Brazil, Trump openly linked the decision to politics. He accused Brazilian courts of pursuing a “witch hunt” against former president Jair Bolsonaro.Furthermore, Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has vowed that the nation will not take orders from Trump.","New US tariffs are set to take effect on August 1 after being delayed twice.

'Good deal for everybody'



'Market-friendly' agreement



Big week for tech giants



Stock markets gained along with the Euro on Monday after the recent European Union and United States deal to resolve a potential trade war that could have caused severe damage.US President Donald Trump on Sunday said that both powers have ‘reached a deal’ on trade and called it a ‘good deal’. He announced that a 15 per cent baseline tariff would be imposed on EU exports to the US.EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and Donald Trump reached a trade deal on Sunday.

These flights are part of a broader pattern of increasing engagement between the two countries.As per news agency AP, over 400 passengers were aboard the inaugural flight. Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov, who recently visited North Korea’s Wonsan-Kalma coastal resort, has promised to promote tourism between the two countries.The newly developed beach resort is central to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un’s strategy to revive the country's economy through tourism.North Korea, which had sealed its borders during the Covid-19 pandemic, has gradually resumed travel links. Train services between the two countries resumed on June 17, and air travel between Pyongyang and Russia’s Vladivostok had already restarted in 2023.The resumption of direct flights comes amid deepening military cooperation between Moscow and Pyongyang. North Korea has supplied weapons and troops to support Russia’s operations in Ukraine, according to AP.In 2024, North Korea confirmed it had deployed its soldiers to fight alongside Russian forces. The two nations also signed a mutual defence pact during Russian President Vladimir Putin’s visit to Pyongyang last year.The renewed air link, symbolic of their strengthening alliance, signals not only increasing military coordination but also a push for broader economic and tourism ties between the heavily sanctioned nations.","The first flight departed from Moscow’s Sheremetyevo airport at 16:25 GMT on Sunday.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume.

Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021.

Startups will play important role in helping India become 3rd largest economy: CEA Nageswaran,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/startups-will-play-important-role-in-helping-india-become-3rd-largest-economy-cea-nageswaran/articleshow/105332523.cms,"Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor ( CEA ) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran Udaan until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.Udaan built an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business still accounts for a very small part of India’s overall retail market but can balloon to $150 billion in sales and yield a 100% return on capital invested in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co. estimates published in the Mint newspaper.Bengaluru-based Udaan has also ventured into financing through its fintech unit which helps shopkeepers get working capital loans to buy inventory. That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says.

How India's GDP has been growing

What SBI report said on savings and investment

Incremental capital output ratio

NEW DELHI: India's gross domestic product (GDP) data for the third quarter (October-December 2022) received a word of caution from the former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan In an interview with news agency PTI, Rajan that India is ""dangerously close"" to the Hindu rate of growth in view of subdued private sector investment, high interest rates and slowing global growth.India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying"".However, a report released by the State Bank of India (SBI) economists on Tuesday dismissed arguments that India is dangerously close to Hindu rate of growth saying such statements are ""ill-conceived, biased and premature"".The term 'Hindu growth rate' was coined by late economist Raj Krishna in 1978 to describe the slow growth in the country.It basically refers to the low pace of economic growth rates during 1950s to 1980s. During this period, the Indian economy averaged 3.5%.A former lecturer at the Delhi School of Economics (DSE), Krishna noted that only if the rate of growth is persistently slow and accompanied by low per-capita GDP, then it will be known as Hindu rate of growth but it has to factor in population growth as well.Before economic reforms of 1991, India's economic growth remained stagnant and low, while per capita income averaged around 1.3%. Krishna termed this low growth situation to be a result of socialist policies of state control and import substitution.However, the economic situation changed when liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation (LPG) reforms came into effect in the year 1991, at a time when India faced balance of payment crisis.Over the years, many economists have strongly opposed the idea of 'Hindu growth rate' and the term never had universal acceptance.The Indian economy plunged into its very first technical recession in FY21 due to the impact of Covid-19 pandemic and the related nationwide lockdowns. GDP shrunk by an unprecedented 23.8% in the first quarter of the financial year 2020-21. However, due to spurt in economic activities in the subsequent quarters, the GDP decline started to narrow.However, if we look at the period before Covid-19 as well, India's growth curve shows a declining trend.From 8.26% in FY17, GDP growth plunged to 3.74% in FY20. Shutdown of economic activities in FY21 in wake of Covid-19 only made matters worse.As lockdowns started to ease and business activities resumed, India's GDP also started rising. In Q1 of FY22, growth jumped to 20.1% mainly on account of low base effect. By the fourth quarter of FY22, growth came down to 4.10%.Similarly, the new financial year 2022-23 brought fresh economic challenges in the form of Russia-Ukraine war that impacted almost all major economies of the world, slowed the pace of growth, pushed inflation to record highs.As a result, the central banks of all advanced economies spurred into action and opted for monetary policy tightening to curb the soaring inflation.With persistently rising interest rates, India's economy grew by 4.4% in Q3 of FY23, as the Centre revised upwards GDP growth for previous year to 9.10% from 8.7% earlier.The report weighed recent GDP numbers against the available data on savings and investments for the past decade and highlighted some interesting points.""Quarterly growth numbers are noisy and should be best avoided for any serious interpretation (on an average, India's GDP growth has witnessed Rs 2 lakh crore upward revision for the 3 year ended FY23),"" the report said.Gross capital formation (GCF) by the government touched a high of 11.8% in 2021-22, up from 10.7% in 2020-21.""This also had a domino effect on private sector investment that jumped from 10 per cent to 10.8% over the same period,"" it said.In fact, Ecowrap added that the trends in GCF to gross output ratio or the plough back of funds for creation of fresh capacity shows that for public administration the ratio attained fresh peak in 2021-22 owing to the emphasis on capital expenditure in recent budgets.At the aggregate level, gross capital formation is supposed to have crossed 32% in 2022-23, the highest level since 2018-19.According to the report, in 2021-22, gross savings have risen to 30% from 29% in 2020-21.""The ratio is supposed to have crossed 31 per cent in 2022-23, the highest since 2018-19. The household savings increased sharply during the pandemic period on account of sharp accretion in financial savings such as deposits,"" said the report by SBI's Economic Research Department.While household financial savings have since then moderated from 15.4% in 2020-21 to 11.1% in 2022-23, savings in physical assets have grown sharply to 11.8% in 2021-22 from 10.7% in 2020-21.The report further analysed Incremental Capital Output ratio (ICOR) -- which measures additional units of capital (investment) needed to produce additional units of output. It said that the ratio has been improving.""ICOR which was 7.5 in FY 12 is now only 3.5 in FY22. Clearly, only half of capital is now needed for next unit of output,"" the report noted.Such reducing ICOR in the current years reflects a relatively increasing efficiency of capital and shows that the economy is on a sound footing, the report said.""From that point of view, future GDP growth rates even at 7% could still mean a decent number by any standards!,"" it added.","India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.

An employee is entitled for a 50 per cent amount of the last drawn salary as pension.OPS was discontinued by the NDA government in 2003 with effect from April 1, 2004.Under the new pension scheme (NPS), employees contribute 10 per cent of their basic salary towards pension while the government contributes 14 per cent.Governments of Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand have informed the central government/ Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA about their decision to restart OPS for their employees.The government of Punjab on November 18, 2022, issued a notification regarding implementation of OPS for the state government employees who are being covered under NPS. Jharkhand too has decided to revert to OPS.",Former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan has expressed his concern over the decision of some states to restart the old pension scheme.

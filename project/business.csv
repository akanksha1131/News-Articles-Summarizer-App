MPC meeting: RBI's three day monetary policy discussions begin today,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/mpc-meeting-rbis-three-day-monetary-policy-discussions-begin-today-another-repo-rate-cut-coming/articleshow/125732317.cms,"Another rate cut? Here's what experts say



The RBI’s three-day monetary policy committee meeting opens in Mumbai on Wednesday, marking the start of the central bank’s latest policy review. Over the course of the discussions, members of the six-member panel is set to hold discussions on how the central bank should navigate policy, in accordance with the newest growth and inflation readings.The meeting will be conducted from December 3 to 5 and the results of the monetary discussions will be announced by RBI governor Sanjay Malhotra at 10 AM on Friday.The review is taking place during a phase in which the economy is showing considerable resilience while prices are cooling at an unprecedented pace.As the Reserve Bank of India prepares to announce its decision this week, the latest economic data has presented a contrasting backdrop — rapid economic expansion on one hand, and historically low inflation on the other.India’s GDP expanded by 8.2% in the second quarter of FY26, a pace of growth that has encouraged expectations of stability in policy action. Economists say the momentum may have extended into the October–December period as well, supported by firm rural demand and improving urban consumption patterns.At the same time, inflation has fallen sharply. Consumer price inflation dropped to a series low of 0.25% in October, driven largely by a decline in food prices.Forecasts suggest this softness could persist and even settle below the Reserve Bank’s own earlier projections.Commenting on the conflicting economic signals, Mehul Pandya, MD and Group CEO of CareEdge Ratings, highlighted how they complicate rate decisions. ""Both these developments (of a continued strong GDP growth and multi-year low inflationary levels) are mutually opposing forces from an interest rate perspective. Central banks usually do not tend to cut interest rates during the periods of strong economic activity, represented by GDP growth. At the same time, the central banks usually respond to a low inflationary environment by cutting interest rates,"" ANI quoted Pandya as saying.Some industry voices believe the data now gives the central bank enough headroom to ease policy. Taking an optimistic view, Mayur Modi, Co-founder and Co-CEO of Moneyboxx Finance Limited, argued that robust growth has widened the RBI’s scope for action. He said, ""With inflation easing to multi-year lows and remaining comfortably within the RBI's tolerance band, the probability of a repo rate cut has strengthened meaningfully. Softening price pressures give the MPC more room to prioritise growth without risking macroeconomic stability."" Modi added that a well-timed reduction could help lift consumption cycles and stimulate credit demand across key segments.Despite growing speculation of a cut, an assessment by Bank of Baroda suggests that the central bank will keep the repo rate unchanged at 5.50% and maintain its neutral stance. The report pointed out that economic performance has continued to beat expectations, with urban spending and a resilient rural economy expected to sustain momentum into the third quarter. It also flagged signs of recovery in private investment, supported by a rise in credit demand.","The RBI’s three-day monetary policy committee meeting opens in Mumbai on Wednesday.

Support is at $4160/$4100. Intermediate resistance is at $4245/$4300. (AI image)

Gold price prediction

:

Gold prices are likely to rise in the near-term, says Praveen Singh, Senior Fundamental Research Analyst- Currencies and Commodities at Mirae Asset Sharekhan. The analyst shares his views on gold and silver price outlook and what levels investors should watch out for:

Gold Performance: Huge weekly gain

On December 1, spot gold traded between $4206 and $4264. The yellow metal at the time of writing this article was trading nearly 0.2% lower at $4230.

The MCX February gold contract at Rs 130,499 was up by 0.77%.

In the week ending November 28, the metal surged 4.25% for the week.

As the Fed leaders including the Governor Waller and NY Fed President Willaims have called for December rate cut, rate cut probability has surged sharply. Kevin Hassett emerging as the leading candidate for the Fed Chair post has further boosted easy monetary policy expectations in near future as he is closely aligned with Trump's economic policies and has called for rate cuts.

Gold advanced for the fourth straight month in November as it registered a gain of 5.75% for the month.

ETF holdings and COMEX inventory: ETF holdings rise

Total known global gold ETF holdings stood at 97.503 MOz as of November 28, the highest level since October 30 and roughly around 3-year high. Holdings rose 0.20 MOz (6.22 tons) in the week ending November 28.

Eligible COMEX gold inventory at 18.2 MOz is down by 18.75% from the cycle peak of 22.45 MOz noted on April 14 in the wake of Trump's 'Liberation Day'. Total COMEX gold inventory stands at 36.35 MOz, down 19.34% from the record peak of 45.07 MOz reached on April 4.

Goldman Sachs gold survey: 36% see gold topping $5K

Data roundup: US and Chinese data weak

S&P Global US manufacturing PMI final data released on December 1 at 52.20 topped the forecast of 51.90 (prior 51.9). However, US ISM manufacturing PMI fell from 48.70 in October to 48.20 in November Vs the forecast of 49 as ISM prices paid rose from 58 to 58.50. ISM manufacturing Index fell to one-year low as manufacturing contracted for the ninth consecutive month. New orders shrank and lagged the forecast., while ISM employment fell to 3-month low of 44 and contracted faster than the forecast 46.

US ADP reported that for the four weeks ending Nov. 8, 2025, private US employers shed an average of 13,500 jobs/week.

China’s official NBS Manufacturing declined for the eighth straight month in November: Although the PMI increased from 49 in October to 49.20, matching the forecast, it remained stuck in the contraction zone. China’s NBS nonmanufacturing PMI came in at 49.50 in November Vs the forecast of 50 (prior 50.10), while China’s RatingDog manufacturing PMI unexpectedly contracted as the PMI came in at 49.90 Vs the estimate of 50.50

US data released last week were mostly disappointing/soft. The Fed Beige book reflected soft consumer spending and a cooling labour market. University of Michigan sentiment came in at 51 in its November final reading, remaining around record low, though inflation expectations eased. US Retail sales advance rose by 0.2% m-o-m in September Vs the forecast of 0.4%. Retail sales control group unexpectedly contracted. PPI final demand was up by 0.3% m-o-m in September that matched the estimate (prior -0.1%) but core PPI increased by 0.1% Vs the forecast of 0.2% (prior -0.1%). Conference Board Consumer Confidence fell from 95.50 in October to 88.70 in November, the lowest since April.

US Dollar Index and yields: Dollar under pressure

Geopolitics watch: Venezuela also in focus

A US delegation led by President Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff will start negotiations over the Ukraine war this week. The situation remains tense as EU's diplomats have expressed concerns that the US may push Ukraine into a skewed peace plan with Russia which may ultimately encourage Russia's war mongering.

US President Trump will hold a meeting tonight on next steps on Venezuela. On November 30, President Donald Trump said airlines should consider the airspace above and around Venezuela to be closed while he pushes for more aggressive steps against President Nicolas Maduro’s government.

December Fed rate cut probability: Almost certain

Upcoming data and events: Focus on ADP, ISM services and PCE Price Index

Major US data on tap this week include ADP employment change (Dec. 3), ISM services (Dec. 3), Import and export price indices (Dec. 3), ISM services (Dec. 3), weekly job report (Dec. 4), PCE Price Index (Dec. 5) and University of Michigan sentiment and inflation expectations (Dec. 5).

European data include Eurozone's unemployment rate (Dec. 2), CPI (Dec. 2), services and composite PMIs (Dec. 3) and 3Q third GDP reading and 3Q final employment reading (Dec. 5). UK's services and composite PMIs will be released on Dec. 3 respectively.

Fed Chair Powell will speak briefly on George Shultz and his economic policy contribution at Memorial Event on Dec. 2.

Michelle Bowman, Vice Chair for Supervision of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, will testify before the House Committee on Dec. 2 and will speak on Bank Supervision and regulation on Dec. 4.

Gold Price Outlook

: Positive

Spot gold is expected to rise further on the Fed rate cut expectations and economic concerns as PMIs out of China and the US disappoint.

Vanke, a leading Chinese property developer, has asked for a 12-month extension to pay its 2 billion yuan note originally due on Dec. 15 along with interest. China Real Estate Information Corp. and China Index Academy withheld monthly home sales figures of the nation’s 100 largest developers for November on Sunday.

Gold may reach all-time high of $4381 in near-term. Support is at $4160/$4100. Intermediate resistance is at $4245/$4300.

Silver: Surges more than 3%

At the time of writing, spot silver was changing hands at $58.28, up 3.18% for the day as the US Dollar Index fell.

In the week ending November 28, spot silver surged nearly 13% on huge ETF inflows and Fed rate cut hopes.

Silver is also benefitting on inventory dislocation as Chinese silver inventory at SGE and SHFE warehouses have plummeted to almost decade-lows.

Gold/Silver ratio has plunged below the strong 200-month support at 73.25, which can boost silver further.

However, as US and Chinese economic indicators do not portray strong economies, investors need to be careful at the current levels.

Overall, silver can extend its rally to $62-$65 level in the coming weeks/months unless risk appetite weakens.

Buying the dips with stop-loss below $54 is the preferred strategy.

Note: Domestic precious metals prices are getting an additional boost from exchange rate moves as the USD-INR surged to a fresh record high on December 1 due to uncertainty over the US-India trade deal.

In a recently concluded survey by Goldman Sachs, nearly 70% of its investors expect gold prices to rise further by the end of 2026. A survey of more than 900 clients revealed that 36% of them see gold topping $5,000 a troy ounce by 2026-end on continued central bank demand (38%) and fiscal worries (27%)At the time of writing this article, the US Dollar Index was seen 0.26% lower at 99.10. Ten-year US yields at 4.09% were up by nearly 8 bps, while 2-year yields rose approximately 1.1% to 3.53%. The US bonds fell on a surge of new corporate bond supply to begin in December. Bonds came under additional pressure on a possibility of Bank of Japan hiking rates in December that pushed the 10-year JGB to its highest level since 2008, while 2-year borrowing costs climbed above 1% for the first time since 2008.December Fed rate cut probability has surged to 88% from 24% on November 20.","Gold prices are likely to rise in the near-term, says Praveen Singh, Senior Fundamental Research Analyst- Currencies and Commodities at Mirae Asset Sharekhan.

Stock market today: Nifty50 and BSE Sensex , the Indian equity benchmark indices, opened flat in trade on Wednesday on weak global cues. While Nifty50 was above 26,000, BSE Sensex was near 85,100. At 9:16 AM, Nifty50 was trading at 26,010.65, down 22 points or 0.083%. BSE Sensex was at 85,116.06, down 22 points or 0.026%.Analysts believe that In the near term, major resistance for the Nifty is placed at 26,325. Until the index persists below this level, any bounce should be used for profit booking, they say.Dr. VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Investments Limited says, “Nifty’s correction of about 300 points from the record high can be seen as a correction driven by technical factors like rejig in the Bank Nifty and the concerns arising from the continued depreciation of the rupee. Rejig in the Bank Nifty and the consequent reduction in the weight of HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank are pure technical factors that have nothing to do with the fundamentals of these stocks. With improving credit growth in the economy and strong fundamentals of these banking majors, they will bounce back in due course. A real concern now, which has contributed to the slow drifting down of the market, is the continued depreciation in the rupee and fears of further depreciation since the RBI is not intervening to support the rupee.This concern is forcing the FIIs to sell despite the improving fundamentals of rising corporate earnings and strong rebound in GDP growth.”“The rupee depreciation will halt and even reverse when the India-US trade deal materialises. This is likely this month. A lot, however, will depend on the details of the tariffs to be imposed on India as part of the deal. The ideal strategy for investors in this period of uncertainty is to remain invested in high quality growth stocks in the large and midcap segments. Smallcaps, as a segment, continue to be overvalued and are, therefore, best avoided. ”US equities finished higher, marking their sixth positive close in seven sessions during quiet trading on Tuesday. Technology shares led the advance amid strong expectations for Federal Reserve rate cuts next week.Asian stocks were flat on Wednesday, reflecting similar patterns on Wall Street, as investors sought new market drivers whilst cryptocurrency recovery lost momentum.Gold prices stayed flat following a 1% decline in the previous session, as rising equities and stable Treasury yields continued to affect the metal whilst traders awaited crucial US economic indicators for insights on potential rate reductions later this week.Foreign portfolio investors recorded net sales of Rs 3,642 crore on Tuesday. Domestic institutional investors registered net purchases of Rs 4,646 crore.","Nifty50 was trading at 26,010.65, down 22 points or 0.083%. BSE Sensex was at 85,116.06, down 0.026%.

HSBC has a buy on Dr Reddys Labs with the target price at Rs 1,430. Analysts said that the semaglutide opportunity is intact for Dr Reddy’s in Canada, and it has replied to Health Canada’s queries on its application.

India is largest selling market globally for Pernod,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/india-is-largest-selling-market-globally-for-pernod/articleshow/125731487.cms,"Premiumisation push to help co target faster growth in India, says India chief executive

NEW DELHI: India has emerged as the biggest volume-grosser for French spirits giant Pernod Ricard, led by strong sales of local whisky brands, such as Royal Stag, Blenders Pride and 100 Pipers, as well as its premium portfolio of products like Chivas Regal, Jameson and Glenlivet.India has also scored strongly in value as it has edged past China to emerge as the second-largest market for Pernod globally, behind only the US, led by rapid premiumisation in market. The company expects demand to stay strong, which is now contributing 13% to its overall global revenues, India CEO Jean Touboul told TOI as the company launched a new locally-made mainstream brand — Xclamat!on — which will have whisky, vodka, gin, brandy and rum under its fold.“It is the fastest growing (market) for sure. And, the one which has the best growth perspective for years to come — I mean for the mid- and long-term. The tailwinds that we are observing in India are structural. So, it’s about the demographic dividend as we like to call it.”The company closed fiscal FY25 (ending June 30) at overall volumes of 67.4 million cases, overtaking the US and China. In value terms, the company has crossed Rs 27,000 crore in revenues in FY25 (ending March 31).Asked about legal cases in Delhi and restrictions on sale in Delhi, he said, “We remain confident in the strength of our legal position and look forward to resume operations in Delhi at the earliest.”Touboul, under whom Pernod also surpassed Diageo to become the biggest spirits company in India, said a younger population is pushing demand. “Population is young. And, so we have every year approximately 20 million of new legal drinking age people. So, it’s 20 million potential new consumers. Of course, not all of them will choose to drink, or drink our brand. But, we are here to propose good offers for them to come in. ”Also, growth in Indian economy has been fuelling demand as well as disposable incomes. “This is something that is working in favour of our strategy of premiumisation. We cater to the higher end of the market. So, when people have a growing revenue (income), they aspire to consume better products.”He said unlike India, the Chinese market is in a “difficult situation” from the macroeconomic standpoint. Not only that, India’s size is now bigger than the earnings from the ‘global travel retail’ category that Pernod makes across brands.Touboul said he sees India emerging as the top revenue market for Pernod globally in the coming years. “In all logic, we will be a number one market for Pernod at some stage. Is it in two, five, or ten years? I don't know. It also depends how fast the US will grow.”","India has also scored strongly in value as it has edged past China to emerge as the second-largest market for Pernod globally, behind only the US.

Situation is ripe for a rate cut: Ficci chief,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/situation-is-ripe-for-a-rate-cut-ficci-chief/articleshow/125731360.cms,"NEW DELHI: While asserting that Indian macroeconomic fundamentals are strong and tax cuts will help boost private sector investment, Anant Goenka, the newly elected Ficci president and vice-chairman of the RPG Group, on Tuesday suggested that the Reserve Bank of India should lower interest rates.“The situation is ripe for a rate cut. Inflation was better than expected. RBI should continue its momentum on rate cutting and pushing towards growth,” he said. Goenka mentioned that there was not much risk to Indian businesses as inflation was under control, the fiscal parameters were healthy, bank and corporate balance sheets were clean and the economy was growing fast. “Macro risks are minimal… The only stress point was the US trade agreement, but should be resolved soon, as both sides have indicated. ”Goenka noted that the impact of US tariffs on Indian businesses was confined to a few sectors such as gems and jewellery, garments, and shrimp. “Diversification to other geographies helped, FTAs may have played a part, and general industry outreach also helped. In fact, the newer FTAs are seeing very good utilisation,” he said.When asked about private investment, he said, a pickup was expected soon as capacity utilisation is improving.“There were some challenges on demand for a few years like high debt, Covid drying up demand, inflationary pressures, and global shocks. But things now look far more stable. With income-tax and GST changes putting nearly Rs 2.5 lakh crore into consumers’ hands, we’ve seen demand pick up strongly since Oct, which should largely sustain. ”While promising to work with govt for smooth implementation of the labour codes, Goenka suggested that there was a need to work on easier rules for land acquisition, cheaper power, and uniformity in rules across states.In the Budget, he said, govt should focus on further indigenisation of defence production, a 30% increase in defence capex, along with a dedicated Rs 10,000-crore allocation for DRDO. A mega electronics and IT park that clusters OEMs and assemblers in a plug-and-play ecosystem and the inclusion of tailings (industrial waste) from mining under the Critical Minerals Mission were the other items on his budget wish list.“Exports should be an area of focus,” Goenka said regarding Ficci’s budget recommendations. “RoDTEP outlay can be on the higher side. Rs 18,000 crore was allocated, but we feel more can be done there, as done with the exports promotion mission.”Goenka also stated that a core focus area for Ficci would be to increase manufacturing from 15% of GDP to 25%, which will require the industry to push harder on R&D, quality, sustainability, women’s participation, and MSME capability, as well as leveraging FTAs to make the industry more resilient in a changing global scenario. “We are not asking the govt to do everything… Indian industry has to up our game further. And I think on trade, particularly a global push by Indian companies is important. I think we need to be much more global in our outlook as an industry rather than focusing just on India,” he said.","Anant Goenka, the newly elected Ficci president and vice-chairman of the RPG Group, on Tuesday suggested that the Reserve Bank of India should lower interest rates. “The situation is ripe for a rate cut.

SC upholds 30L fine on RIL over lapse in disclosing Jio-FB deal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sc-upholds-30l-fine-on-ril-over-lapse-in-disclosing-jio-fb-deal/articleshow/125731282.cms,"Supreme Court

RIL should’ve clarified to stop speculation: SC

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Tuesday endorsed an order of Securities Appellate Tribunal that had upheld SEBI’s Rs 30-lakh fine against Reliance Industries (RIL) and its compliance officers for failing to make prompt disclosures on the Rs 43,000-cr Reliance Jio-Facebook deal in 2020 despite it being reported in media.A bench of CJI Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi told RIL counsel that for a fine of Rs 30 lakh, RIL cannot be seen burdening the court with litigation. For RIL, Senior advocate Ritin Rai said it is not Rs 30 lakh that bothers the petitioner. The question is the impact of SAT finding on all listed companies.Rai said when a London-based newspaper reported about the ongoing negotiations between Jio and Facebook, the agreement had not been finalised.Senior advocate Ritin Rai said, “RIL has paid the penalty amount. But the question is should a listed company report to Sebi about negotiations or on fructification of an agreement? Moreover, it is impossible for listed companies to respond to every speculative report by the media. Today’s media is not what it used to be in the past.”Supreme Court said if unverified reports are appearing in media, it becomes a duty under Sebi Prohibition of Insider Trading (PIT) Regulations for listed companies to respond with particulars.“When the report first disclosed about the Jio-Facebook negotiations on March 24, 2020, RIL shares registered a 15% increase, and when the announcement was made by RIL about the deal on Apr 22, 2020, the share prices again increased by 10%,” the bench said.Rai said there is no allegation of insider trading by anyone. The bench said PIT Regulation is a set of ethical norms and there cannot be any leniency about its compliance. “Bigger the entity, bigger the responsibility to scrupulously adhere to PIT Regulation,” the bench said.“The very fact that you chose to remain silent after the Financial Times, London, reported about Jio-Facebook negotiations is a breach of the regulations. The moment such news appears in the media, speculative trade is bound to happen given the magnitude of the deal. RIL should have clarified that the agreement is in the negotiation stage. Selective and speculative media reports require entities to mandatorily clear the air to stop speculation in the market,” the bench said.Dismissing RIL’s appeal against May 2 SAT order, the bench said the conclusions drawn by Sebi regarding violations of PIT regulations does not warrant any interference from the SC. “That apart, the issue dealt by SAT is substantially based on facts and no question of law arises which may warrant consideration by the SC,” the bench said.","Supreme Court said if unverified reports are appearing in media, it becomes a duty under Sebi Prohibition of Insider Trading (PIT) Regulations for listed companies to respond with particulars.

‘Tesla is ridiculously overvalued’: Big Short investor Michael Burry warns Musk’s $1 trillion payout will erode value,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/tesla-is-ridiculously-overvalued-big-short-investor-michael-burry-warns-musks-1-trillion-payout-will-erode-value/articleshow/125727364.cms,"Michael Burry says dilution is eating into Tesla’s real worth

A broader critique of tech’s accounting habits

Market reaction and mixed sentiment

Big Short investor Michael Burry has cast doubt on Tesla’s lofty valuation and warned that CEO Elon Musk ’s newly approved $1 trillion compensation package could place even more strain on shareholder returns. In a weekend post on his Substack newsletter, Burry wrote that the electric-vehicle maker’s market value is “ridiculously overvalued” and has been “for a good long time”. His critique focuses largely on how Tesla and other tech firms account for stock-based compensation, which he believes distorts the way investors perceive true profitability.Burry explained that Tesla’s share count increases by roughly 3.6% each year because the company routinely awards employees significant amounts of stock. Since Tesla does not buy back shares to counterbalance these awards, existing shareholders effectively own a smaller slice of the company each year.He shared a chart with his subscribers to illustrate how this steady dilution can erode a company’s present value, especially over long periods. According to Burry, when the real cost of stock-based compensation is fully considered, Tesla’s valuation looks much less defensible than its headline numbers suggest.He also pointed to Musk’s newly approved pay package as a major accelerant. The plan, which passed with 75% shareholder support, could give Musk tens or even hundreds of millions of new Tesla shares if performance targets are met. This could take Musk’s personal stake from 15% to roughly 29%, reducing the ownership percentage of every other shareholder.“Dilution is certain to continue,” Burry wrote, adding that this structural issue is a core reason he believes Tesla’s market value is disconnected from reality.Burry directed part of his criticism at the wider technology industry. He said many tech companies remove stock-based compensation from their “adjusted” earnings results, creating a version of profitability that overlooks a major recurring expense. He argued that companies such as Tesla, Amazon and Palantir routinely benefit from this practice because it makes their financial performance appear healthier than it truly is.He reinforced his point by referencing Warren Buffett, who has long argued that stock-based pay is a real cost to shareholders and should never be treated as an optional footnote.Tesla’s share price dipped slightly after Burry’s comments circulated, although the stock is still up more than 6% this year. Tesla remains valued at about $1.43 trillion.Burry also commented on Tesla’s shifting identity. He said the company’s strongest supporters have changed their narrative repeatedly over the years, moving from electric vehicles to autonomous driving and now to humanoid robots. In his view, this frequent repositioning reflects a company that is constantly searching for its next big justification for growth.The remarks were published on Burry’s newly launched Substack, Cassandra Unchained, which he started after deregistering Scion Asset Management. Many of his recent posts focus on what he believes are emerging bubbles in multiple sectors, particularly artificial intelligence.","Big Short investor Michael Burry says Tesla’s market value is ‘ridiculously overvalued’ His critique focuses largely on how Tesla and other tech firms account for stock-based compensation, which he believes distorts the way investors perceive true profitability.

Philanthropy boost: Michael and Susan Dell pledge $6.25bn for ‘Trump Accounts’ launch; major gift aims to spur families to sign up,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/philanthropy-boost-michael-and-susan-dell-pledge-6-25bn-for-trump-accounts-launch-major-gift-aims-to-spur-families-to-sign-up/articleshow/125721819.cms,"Photo credit- AP

Billionaires Michael and Susan Dell on Tuesday announced a $6.25 billion commitment to encourage American families to open the new children’s investment accounts created under President Donald Trump’s tax and spending legislation, according to AP. The pledge is intended to reach 25 million children under the age of 10 by seeding each eligible account with an initial deposit.The Dells’ gift stands out globally for its size, with few single philanthropic contributions in the last 25 years surpassing even $1 billion, let alone several billion. Announced on GivingTuesday, they believe it is the largest single private commitment ever made to support US children.The contribution will operate through investment accounts administered by the US Department of the Treasury and managed by private firms. The accounts — dubbed “Trump Accounts” in the legislation — are part of a programme passed into law on July 4 and scheduled to launch on July 4, 2026.“We believe that if every child can see a future worth saving for, this program will build something far greater than an account. It will build hope and opportunity and prosperity for generations to come,” said Michael Dell, whose net worth is estimated at $148 billion, AP reported.Through their pledge, the Dells will deposit $250 into each qualifying child’s account. Dell said they chose the launch date to coincide with the 250th anniversary of US independence. “We want these kids to know that not only do their families care, but their communities care, their government, their country cares about them,” said Susan Dell.Under the new law, the Treasury will automatically deposit $1,000 for children born between Jan. 1, 2025 and Dec. 31, 2028, with all funds invested in a stock-market index fund. Families of other children will need to contribute themselves, and the accumulated balance can be used at 18 to pay for education, housing or to start a business.The Dells hope their contribution will push families to claim the accounts and add even small deposits over time while also encouraging companies and philanthropists to participate.“It’s hard to give effective dollars away at scale, particularly to the country’s neediest kids in a way that you have confidence that those dollars are going to compound with the upside of the U.S. economy,” said venture capitalist Brad Gerstner, who supported the legislation and is founder of the Invest America Charitable Foundation, which is helping the Treasury launch the accounts.Gerstner said the initiative aims not only to give young people a financial start but also to ensure they share in the gains of the economy. “Fundamentally, we need to include everybody in the upside of the American experiment. Otherwise, it won’t last,” he said.AP noted that only 58% of US households held stocks or bonds in 2022, with the wealthiest 1% owning nearly half the value of all stocks, while the bottom 50% held about 1%. In 2024, about 13% of US children and young people lived in poverty, according to the Annie E. Casey Foundation, reflecting the lack of social supports such as paid parental leave.The Dells’ contribution will be directed to children living in ZIP codes with median family incomes of $150,000 or less. While the Trump Accounts may help young adults with long-term saving, the initiative will not immediately reduce child poverty. Cuts to Medicaid, food stamps and child-care benefits in the spending package are expected to diminish short-term support for low-income families.Ray Boshara, senior policy adviser with both the Aspen Institute and Washington University in St. Louis, welcomed the multi-sector contribution model. He said the concept resembles other landmark programmes that improved over time. “The ACA, Social Security – they start off fairly flawed, but get much better and more progressive and inclusive over time,” he said. “It’s a down payment on a big idea that deserves to be improved and there’s bipartisan interest in improving them. ”Through the Michael & Susan Dell Foundation, the couple has reported giving $2.9 billion since 1999, with a strong focus on education. Michael Dell said they had not initially expected to commit so much to the new accounts, but Susan Dell said the scale grew as they assessed the programme’s long-term potential. “We’re thrilled to be spearheading this in the philanthropy sector and are so excited because we know that more people are going to jump on board,” she said.",Billionaires Michael and Susan Dell announced a $6.25 billion commitment to encourage American families to open the new children’s investment accounts.

The Nasdaq composite gained 0.6%. MongoDB surged 24.6% after the New York-based database company reported stronger quarterly results than analysts expected. United Natural Foods of Providence, Rhode Island, also advanced 8.4% following a better-than-anticipated profit.Those moves helped offset a 5.6% slide in Signet Jewelers. The company issued a holiday-season revenue forecast that missed market expectations and said it anticipates “a measured consumer environment.”US economy has held up comparatively well, though widening divides persist. Lower-income households remain under pressure from inflation that is still running above preferred levels, while higher-income households benefit from an equity market near the all-time high set in late October.In the bond market, yields were mixed after the previous day’s sharp moves. The 10-year Treasury yield nudged up to 4.10% from 4.09%, while the two-year yield eased to 3.52% from 3.54%. Higher yields can weigh on valuations across asset classes, particularly for sectors considered expensive.Bitcoin, which had fallen below $85,000 on Monday, recovered toward $89,000.Monday’s climb in yields followed comments from the Bank of Japan hinting it may raise interest rates soon. Market expectations still point to another US Federal Reserve rate cut at next week’s meeting in Washington. The Fed has already reduced its overnight rate twice this year to support a slowing job market, though inflation remains above the 2% target, leaving the subsequent policy path uncertain.Overseas, markets moved modestly across much of Europe and Asia.

Turning to ChatGPT



SoftBank Group founder Masayoshi Son revealed that he “was crying” when he sold the company’s stake in Nvidia, highlighting how reluctant he was to part with the fast-rising chipmaker. This emotional exit raises a key question — what compelled Japan’s second-richest man to give up the shares despite not wanting to?Speaking at the FII Priority Asia forum in Tokyo on Monday, Son addressed SoftBank’s November disclosure that it had sold its full Nvidia holding for $5.83 billion. He said that the move was driven purely by the need to raise capital for AI investments and not lack of confidence in Nvidia.He acknowledged the emotional difficulty of the sale and stressed that the shares would not have been offloaded if SoftBank did not need the money.“I don’t want to sell a single share. I just had more need for money to invest in OpenAI and other projects,” Son said during the event, as cited by CNBC.“I was crying to sell Nvidia shares.”His comments reflect the explanation provided by analysts and SoftBank executives in November, when they described the sale as part of broader efforts to bolster the SoftBank Vision Fund’s cash resources for AI.SoftBank has intensified its focus on artificial intelligence this year through a series of projects, including plans for Stargate Project data centres and the acquisition of US chip designer Ampere Computing.SoftBank’s AI push also includes a substantial bet on OpenAI. The Japanese company could “potentially” increase its investment in the ChatGPT maker depending on performance and the valuation of further rounds, according to a person familiar with the matter who spoke to CNBC.Earlier this year, Son said SoftBank was “all in” on OpenAI and predicted that the AI startup would one day become the most valuable company in the world. The bet has already delivered financial benefits, with SoftBank reporting last month that its second-quarter net profit more than doubled to 2.5 trillion yen ($16.6 billion), driven by valuation gains in its OpenAI holdings.Questions around the scale of investment going into AI have fuelled market concerns about the possibility of an AI bubble. Son pushed back against that view during his speech on Monday, arguing that critics are underestimating the sector.He said that those who talk about an AI bubble are “not smart enough” and predicted that “super [artificial] intelligence” and AI robots will generate at least 10% of global gross domestic product over the long term, which he said would outweigh trillions of dollars of investment in the technology.",SoftBank Group founder Masayoshi Son revealed that he “was crying” when he sold the company’s stake in Nvidia.

Trade reset: China issues rare earth licences; questions persist over wider access,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/trade-reset-china-issues-rare-earth-licences-questions-persist-over-wider-access/articleshow/125719367.cms,"‘Good Policy In Place’: Rare Earth Expert On India’s National Critical Minerals Mission

Auto-linked suppliers receive clearances

Gap remains between Beijing and Washington

China’s rare earth industry is set for faster shipments to select buyers after authorities issued the first batch of new export licences, a step that follows months of disruption caused by Beijing’s tighter controls earlier this year. The move reflects a key outcome of the Donald Trump–Xi Jinping summit, according to Reuters.The approvals mark a shift from a system that forced companies to apply for each shipment individually, a process that created shortages across the auto supply chain and strengthened Beijing’s leverage in trade talks with Washington. Reuters reported that the new “general licences” were designed to ease those pressures and allow exports under year-long permits for specific customers.A source told Reuters that China has now granted these licences to several major suppliers, including JL Mag Rare Earth, Ningbo Yunsheng and Beijing Zhong Ke San Huan High-Tech, though some clients are still awaiting approval.JL Mag has received general licences for nearly all its customers, while Ningbo Yunsheng and Beijing Zhong Ke San Huan High-Tech have secured approvals for part of their client base, the source said, declining to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter.The three companies and China’s Ministry of Commerce did not immediately respond to questions.All three firms serve the automotive industry among others, according to their websites. JL Mag operates a subsidiary in Europe, and Ningbo Yunsheng says it supplies clients in Europe and the Americas.The new permits will add to, rather than replace, the existing licensing system. For now, only large Chinese rare earth companies qualify for general licences, though eligibility could widen if the rollout proceeds smoothly, the source added.The development narrows, but does not close, differences in how Washington and Beijing described the leaders’ summit in South Korea. The White House portrayed the general licences as effectively ending China’s rare earth controls, while Beijing has offered little public commentary and no indication its broader regime will be dismantled.It also remains unclear how widely the new licences will be granted or whether certain customers — including defence, aerospace or semiconductor-linked sectors — may be excluded.European companies, meanwhile, again raised concerns on Monday about delays and limited transparency in the existing export-control framework.","China's rare earth industry is set for faster shipments to select buyers after authorities issued the first batch of new export licences.

Bitcoin meltdown: Strategy stock tanks over 60%; retail ETF wipe-outs spark fresh fears for major benchmarks,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/bitcoin-meltdown-strategy-stock-tanks-over-60-retail-etf-wipe-outs-spark-fresh-fears-for-major-benchmarks/articleshow/125718058.cms,"Leveraged bets unravel

Funding strain and index threat

Retail investors who chased Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin vision are now confronting heavy losses, as the turmoil around Strategy Inc.’s stock intensifies and leveraged products tied to it unwind sharply.The rout has erased gains built during the crypto mania and left funds tracking the company’s volatile bets struggling to retain assets. The developments were reported by Bloomberg.Strategy -- once seen as a simple route to hold Bitcoin through a listed stock — has dived more than 60% from recent highs. The company said on Monday that it had created a $1.4 billion reserve to manage dividend and interest payouts, a step meant to ease concerns it might be forced to sell Bitcoin if prices fall further.For many investors, that reassurance came too late. MSTX and MSTU, two funds offering double the daily return on Strategy’s stock, have each fallen more than 80% this year, placing them among the 10 worst performers in a US ETF universe of more than 4,700 products. A third fund, MSTP, launched in June, has dropped by a similar amount. Together, the trio has shed about $1.5 billion in assets since early October.Retail interest had originally surged when firms such as Defiance and Tuttle Capital Management rolled out these high-octane products to mirror one of Wall Street’s most visible Bitcoin-proxy trades.Strategy shares slid 34% in November. Bitcoin, down roughly 30% from its October peak, trades near $87,000, while the stock closed Monday 3.3% lower after falling as much as 12% during the day. Bitcoin advanced 0.5% as of 6.20am in London on Tuesday.“The recent pullback in Bitcoin has hit Strategy’s stock hard, and 2x leveraged plays like MSTX and MSTU turn that into even larger losses,” said Roxanna Islam, head of sector and industry research at ETF shop TMX VettaFi. “It’s a reminder that leveraged single-stock ETFs can look great on the way up, but can erase gains very quickly when the underlying trade goes the other way.”Defiance declined to comment. Tuttle Capital and GraniteShares, which is behind MSTP, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.At the centre of the market’s worries is mNAV, a metric comparing Strategy’s enterprise value with its Bitcoin holdings. The premium embedded in that ratio has largely evaporated, pulling it to about 1.15, a level executives have described as a caution zone. CEO Phong Le said on a podcast that slipping below 1.0 could force the firm to sell Bitcoin to meet payout obligations, though only as a last resort.The new reserve, financed through recent equity sales, covers at least 21 months of dividend and interest payments. But it has not quelled concerns over Strategy’s dependence on leverage, its reliance on retail flows, and the strain on its capital model.To keep buying Bitcoin, Strategy has repeatedly issued common stock — a move that dilutes existing shareholders. With its valuation premium narrowing, the company has shifted towards preferred shares and other costlier capital to sustain its crypto strategy.The ETF ecosystem linked to Strategy is also struggling. At least 15 products tied to the stock are currently trading, many down double digits this year. Combined assets for MSTX, MSTU and MSTP have fallen from more than $2.3 billion in early October to about $830 million, Bloomberg data show.The broader crypto slump — despite increased institutional participation and political support from the Trump White House — has dragged down miners, altcoins and firms with token-heavy treasuries. Leveraged ETFs, popular with at-home traders earlier this year, are among the hardest hit.These funds aim to deliver double Strategy’s daily move. In volatile markets, compounding returns — known as volatility decay — can steadily erode performance even if the underlying stock ends flat. When Strategy’s shares dropped and whipsawed, the ETFs amplified the losses.“Leveraged ETFs are generally a dangerous investment. A leveraged ETF on shares of a stock that levers up to buy a highly speculative asset is a risk profile of its own,” said Michael O’Rourke, chief market strategist at Jonestrading.Strategy may now face removal from key benchmarks. Analysts at JPMorgan warned that the stock could be excluded from indices such as the MSCI USA and the Nasdaq 100, a shift that could unleash billions in passive outflows. The reversal is striking for a firm once viewed as a potential S&P 500 entrant.","Strategy shares slid 34% in November.

"Omnicom to slash 4,000 jobs: Media giant consolidates key agencies; AI disruption shapes industry landscape",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/omnicom-to-slash-4000-jobs-media-giant-consolidates-key-agencies-ai-disruption-shapes-industry-landscape/articleshow/125713117.cms,"Biggest Tech Layoffs of 2025: Job Cuts at TCS, Intel, Microsoft, Google and more

Omnicom will lay off more than 4,000 employees and merge several prominent advertising agency brands following its $13 billion acquisition of rival Interpublic Group.The job cuts will primarily affect administrative roles, with some leadership positions also impacted, reported the Financial Times on Monday, citing company executives.Omnicom CEO John Wren said. “The financial benefits would surpass the $750 million in annual cost savings initially projected to investors,” he added. Wren will remain chair and chief executive of the combined entity.The move comes as the advertising industry undergoes a major transformation, with artificial intelligence reshaping creative production and tech companies like Meta enabling businesses to produce ads faster and at scale. Omnicom’s acquisition of IPG is part of a strategy to regain momentum amid fierce competition from French ad giant Publicis and UK-based WPP.As part of the integration, creative agency DDB, founded in 1949, and marketing agency MullenLowe will be merged into Omnicom’s TBWA network. FCB, one of IPG’s largest global agency networks with roots dating back to 1873, will be absorbed into Omnicom’s BBDO, the report said.Executives noted that Omnicom’s restructuring should be seen in the context of similar changes at rivals such as WPP, which is also expected to reduce staff under new CEO Cindy Rose, according to the Financial Times.Interpublic Group had already cut about 3,200 employees in the first nine months of 2025, while Omnicom itself reduced its workforce by 3,000 last year, bringing total staff to roughly 75,000, the report added.","Omnicom will lay off more than 4,000 employees and merge several prominent advertising agency brands.

"Asian stocks today: Markets climb amid US rate cut hopes, Japan bond jitters; Kospi nears 2%, Nikkei up over 56 points",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/asian-stocks-today-markets-climb-amid-us-rate-cut-hopes-japan-bond-jitters-kospi-nears-2-nikkei-up-over-56-points/articleshow/125709502.cms,".

Asian markets mostly rose on Tuesday as investors focused on hopes of United States rate cuts and nerves around rising Japanese bond yields eased slightly.In Hong Kong, HSI rose 0.11%, rising 28 points to reach 26,061. Nikkei also rose 56 points to trade at 49,360 at 10:30 AM IST.South Korea's Kospi added 1.81% to 3,991.Meanwhile in China, Shanghai and Shenzhen were down 0.55% and 0.77%, respectively.The latest lift in stocks followed a muted trading session on Monday, but sentiments turned after another batch of weak US economic numbers strengthened confidence that the Federal Reserve is moving closer to cutting interest rates. Hopes of rate relief have repeatedly buoyed equities over recent weeks, helping markets erase the slump triggered earlier in November by jitters over a possible tech bubble.Expectations of a third straight cut gained further traction after multiple Fed officials indicated that preserving employment now takes priority over pushing down elevated prices. Recent figures have offered support for that shift in stance, with the broader economy, particularly the labour market, showing signs of softening while inflation appears largely stable for the moment.A fresh survey from the Institute for Supply Management revealed that US factory activity contracted for a ninth month in a row, reinforcing that narrative.With the macro signals favouring risk assets again, Asia entered Tuesday on firmer footing. Hong Kong, Sydney, Seoul, Singapore, Taipei, Wellington, Manila and Jakarta all traded higher. Shanghai bucked the trend with a dip. Tokyo also managed to climb after suffering heavy losses the previous day, when Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda unsettled global markets by hinting at the possibility of an interest rate increase this month.Ueda’s remarks sent the yen sharply higher and pushed yields on Japanese two-year government bonds beyond the one percent mark, a level not seen since the 2008 global financial crisis. Although the Japanese currency steadied on Tuesday, the effects of the shock lingered. The comments contributed to a pullback on Wall Street following last week’s Thanksgiving rally and reduced appetite for risk, dragging the cryptocurrency market lower as well.Markets are now keeping a close watch on a scheduled auction of 10-year Japanese government bonds later on Tuesday, seen as a key test of sentiment following the recent spike in yields.Meanwhile in corporate news, one of the biggest moves in the region came from Seoul. Shares of Samsung Electronics jumped more than two percent after the tech heavyweight unveiled its first triple-folding smartphone. The company acknowledged that its price, more than $2,400, is likely to put the device beyond the reach of most consumers, but investors appeared enthusiastic nonetheless.","Hong Kong, Sydney, Seoul, Singapore, Taipei, Wellington, Manila and Jakarta all traded higher.

"Starbucks settlement: Coffee chain to pay $35 mn to 15,000 NYC workers; Mamdani and others join striking baristas",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/starbucks-settlement-coffee-chain-to-pay-35-mn-to-15000-nyc-workers-mamdani-and-others-join-striking-baristas/articleshow/125708715.cms,"Starbucks, one of the world’s biggest coffee chains, has finally agreed to hand over about $35 million to more than 15,000 New York City workers after claims that shifts were slashed without warning and schedules kept in constant flux. The announcement landed on Monday, just hours before Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani and US Senator Bernie Sanders walked onto a Brooklyn picket line to visit protesting baristas.The settlement comes in the middle of a union-led strike that began last month across dozens of stores nationwide. Workers argued that their demands are simple: better staffing and more stable hours. But frustration only grew as almost four years passed since baristas at a Buffalo branch first came together to strike against the organisation, and a contract has still not materialised. Since then, unionisation has spread to around 550 of Starbucks’ 10,000 company-owned outlets. A further 7,000 stores operate under licence in airports, supermarkets and other venues.Both the company and union workers dispute the scale of the strike’s impact. Even so, Mamdani, Sanders and a group of state and city officials added political firepower to the movement on Monday, joining scores of baristas and supporters outside a Brooklyn Starbucks.“These are not demands of greed — these are demands of decency,” Mamdani said. Some workers held oversized cut-outs of Starbucks takeaway cups, swapping the company’s branding with the union’s. Sanders said, “Starbucks has refused to sit down and negotiate a fair contract.”Strikers described a workplace buckling under pressure, understaffed shifts, unpredictable scheduling and online orders so complex that the list of ingredients sometimes stretches beyond the height of the cup. “It is the company's issue to give us the labor amount to schedule partners fairly, and they are not scheduling us fairly, no matter how much money we are making them,” said Gabriel Pierre, 26, a shift supervisor at a suburban Bellmore shop.Meanwhile, the Seattle-based chain has been trying to regain its financial footing. Cost-conscious customers have been pressing pause on premium coffees, questioning whether they still justify the price. Starbucks recently recorded its first rise in same-store sales in nearly two years, but restructuring costs, store redesigns and other changes dragged on profits in the July–September quarter.The settlement announced by New York City’s Department of Consumer and Worker Protection further requires Starbucks to pay $3.4 million in civil penalties in addition to the $35 million earmarked for workers. Additionally, the company agreed to follow the city’s Fair Workweek law from here on.Starbucks said that it is committed to responsible operations and compliance with local laws, while acknowledging the difficulty of the rules in question. “This is notoriously challenging to manage,"" spokesperson Jaci Anderson said.Most hourly employees affected will receive $50 for each week worked between July 2021 and July 2024, the department confirmed. Staff who experienced violations after that window can still seek compensation by filing a complaint.The deal also guarantees reinstatement opportunities for employees laid off during recent store closures in the city.For many baristas, the fight continues. “I sure hope that it gives Starbucks an awakening,” said Kaari Harsila, 21, a shift supervisor from Brooklyn who joined the picket line.",The settlement comes in the middle of a union-led strike that began last month across dozens of stores nationwide.

It reaffirms our commitment to developing advanced anti-infective solutions for the world and demonstrates what Indian science and innovation can achieve on the global stage.”Analysts expect the formal NDA approval to come through over the next six to nine months, with Zaynich to be reviewed under the fast track process.It will be interesting to watch how the company markets the drug in the US, and whether it enters into a licensing deal for the purpose, analysts told TOI.A novel β-lactam enhancer mechanism based Zaynich has garnered international attention for its potent activity against highly resistant Gram-negative pathogens—microbes responsible for prolonged hospitalizations and significant mortality worldwide.","Mumbai-based pharma firm Wockhardt announced that the United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) has accepted its New Drug Application (NDA) for its novel, first-in-class antibiotic Zaynich.

US markets today: Wall Street falls as Bitcoin sinks; manufacturing slowdown and tariff pressures deepen concerns,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-markets-today-wall-street-falls-as-bitcoin-sinks-manufacturing-slowdown-and-tariff-pressures-deepen-concerns/articleshow/125699059.cms,".

US markets moved lower on Monday, giving back part of last week’s gains as bitcoin and other once-popular assets continued to weaken. The S&P 500 was down 0.4% in morning trading, putting its five-day winning run at risk. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 204 points, also 0.4%, and the Nasdaq composite edged down 0.5%.Earlier rally had been fueled by optimism that the Federal Reserve may cut interest rates at its meeting next week to support a cooling labor market. Those expectations remain strong, with CME Group data showing traders see almost an 88% chance of a rate cut, reported AP.Even so, yields on long-term US government bonds moved higher. This followed a rise in global yields after the Bank of Japan’s chief suggested that interest rates there could increase. When bond yields rise, they often draw investors away from riskier markets, putting pressure on stocks and cryptocurrencies in particular.Bitcoin, which had been around $125,000 in October, slid below $86,000 — a 5% more drop than yesterday. The decline weighed on crypto-linked companies: Coinbase Global fell 3.7% and Robinhood Markets dropped 4.6%.Strategy, previously known as MicroStrategy, tumbled 8% after saying it had raised $1.44 billion in US dollars through stock sales to help cover dividends on preferred shares and pay interest on its debt.Synopsys was among the strongest performers, rising 3.9% after revealing that Nvidia will invest $2 billion in the company as part of a deepened partnership. Nvidia, now the most influential stock on Wall Street, recovered from early losses to close 0.9% higher.Investors also reacted to early reports from the holiday shopping weekend. Spending during Black Friday and Cyber Monday appeared to exceed projections despite ongoing concerns about the broader US economy. Amazon inched up 0.4%, while Best Buy slipped 1.9%.Global markets showed mixed results. France’s CAC 40 index eased 0.3%, partly due to a 5.1% decline in Airbus. The company said that most of its 6,000 A320 aircraft had been updated after a software issue discovered over the weekend that could affect flight controls. Airlines faced minor disruptions as they rushed to apply the fix during one of the busiest travel periods of the year.In Japan, the Nikkei 225 dropped 1.9% amid worries that the country’s long-standing near-zero interest rates may soon rise as inflation remains above the Bank of Japan’s 2% target.In the US, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note climbed to 4.08% from 4.02% at the end of last week. It briefly went past 4.09% before easing after a report showed US factory activity declined more than expected. Manufacturers reported weak hiring conditions and said they are “still more focused on managing headcount than on hiring,” as quoted by AP.Several companies also mentioned ongoing challenges related to tariffs, with one saying, “Conditions are more trying than during the coronavirus pandemic in terms of supply chain uncertainty.”","The S&P 500 was down 0.4% in morning trading, putting its five-day winning run at risk.

Bitcoin fell sharply on Monday, slipping below $86,000 in early Asian trade as renewed selling hit the cryptocurrency market at the start of December.The world’s largest digital asset dropped by 6%. Ether also declined more than 7% to around $2,800, while other major tokens, including Solana also registered steep losses. Traders said that the broader slump signals a fresh risk-off mood among investors, according to a report by Bloomberg.The crypto market has been struggling since a wave of leveraged positions. The market worth nearly $19 billion was wiped out in early October, shortly after Bitcoin touched a record high of $126,251. The token shed nearly 17% in November, although a brief recovery last week had lifted prices above $90,000.“It’s a risk-off start to December,” said Sean McNulty, APAC derivatives trading lead at FalconX.“The biggest concern is the meager inflows into Bitcoin exchange-traded funds and absence of dip buyers. We expect the structural headwinds to continue this month. We are watching $80,000 on Bitcoin as the next key support level,” McNulty added.Sentiment weakened further after comments from Strategy Inc. CEO Phong Le, who said the company could sell some of its massive Bitcoin holdings if required to support dividends.Strategy holds about $56 billion worth of Bitcoin.Adding to market jitters, S&P Global Ratings last week downgraded its stability assessment of USDT, the world’s largest stablecoin, citing the risk of under-collateralization if Bitcoin prices continue to fall.Meanwhile, the People’s Bank of China issued fresh warnings over the risks of virtual currencies and urged tighter action against illegal crypto activities.Market participants are now watching key US economic data due this week, which could influence expectations on future interest-rate cuts by the Federal Reserve.US President Donald Trump on Sunday said that he had finalized his choice for the next Fed chair, fueling further speculation over policy direction in 2026.Crypto traders caution that volatility may remain high in the near term as global financial markets react to shifting rate expectations and regulatory signals.","The world’s largest digital asset dropped by 6%.

Stock markets in Asia opened on a steady note on Monday as optimism over a possible US interest rate cut supported risk appetite at the start of the final month of 2025.Investors also kept a close watch on the Japanese yen, which strengthened amid expectations of a near-term policy shift in Tokyo.The yen advanced to 155.64 per US dollar as Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda delivered a speech in Nagoya. Ueda said the central bank would weigh the “pros and cons” of raising interest rates at its next policy meeting in December, a comment that investors parsed for signals on the timing of a long-awaited hike.MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was steady at 703.19, up 23.5% so far this year and on track for its strongest annual performance since 2017. Japan’s Nikkei, however, slipped 1.3% in early trading.Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index climbed more than 1%, helping support broader Asian stocks, though US futures traded lower during Asian hours.“The risk bulls roll into December feeling positive about directional bias,” said Chris Weston, head of research at Pepperstone. As earlier concerns faded, he said, investors were now driven by the fear of missing out and underperforming benchmarks.Markets will be guided this week by US economic releases on manufacturing, services and consumer sentiment. Analysts say volatility could rise as traders weigh whether the economy is cooling without slipping into recession.“With the US data void finally being filled and a busy economic calendar ahead, December looks set to be a merry one for volatility hunters,” said Matt Simpson, senior market analyst at StoneX in Brisbane.He added that a controlled slowdown would likely keep sentiment upbeat while weakening the US dollar, which typically softens at year-end.The dollar index was little changed at 99.414, after falling 8% so far this year, most of the losses coming in early 2025.Investors will also track remarks from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell later on Monday, as dovish signals have increased confidence that a rate cut could come this month. Traders are now pricing an 87% probability of a cut.Holiday shopping trends remain another key indicator. US online spending on Black Friday hit a record $11.8 billion, up 9.1% from last year, according to Adobe Analytics.In commodities, oil prices rose after OPEC+ decided to keep output unchanged for the first quarter of 2026 amid worries about a potential supply glut. Brent crude futures gained 1% to $63.03 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude added 0.99% to $59.16.Meanwhile, Japan’s finance minister issued yet another warning against sharp foreign-exchange swings, saying recent yen moves were “clearly not driven by fundamentals.”Authorities have struggled to slow the currency’s slide as traders weigh doubts over the timing of the next rate hike and fiscal risks under Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi.","MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was steady at 703.19.

Rich Dad Poor Dad author’s advice to investors: ‘The biggest crash in history starts and the best option is to…’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/rich-dad-poor-dad-authors-advice-to-investors-the-biggest-crash-in-history-starts-and-the-best-option-is-to/articleshow/125664878.cms,"Rich Dad’s Prophecy revived



A history of dramatic and contested predictions

Rich Dad Poor Dad author Robert Kiyosaki has reignited debate over his long-running market warnings after posting on X that “the biggest crash in history” has already begun. His message paints a picture of an economy under pressure from rapid technological change and widening global instability. Citing an AI-driven erosion of jobs and deepening stress in real estate markets, Kiyosaki argues that the financial landscape is shifting far faster than most expect, and that only those who prepare for a more turbulent era will be able to shield themselves from the heavy losses he believes lie ahead. In the latest post, he adds that the “best option” for investors is silver, while also urging them to consider gold during volatility.Kiyosaki’s latest message draws directly from his 2002 book Rich Dad’s Prophecy, reprinted in 2013, where he predicted a historic market meltdown. His new post links the downturn to artificial intelligence, claiming job losses across the US, Europe and Asia are now triggering the market spiral he warned about more than two decades ago. He maintains that silver remains the “best option” for investors looking to protect themselves.Silver prices have continued climbing. As of 29 November 2025, the metal sits at about $56.70 per ounce, a 13 percent increase from the $50 level Kiyosaki referenced on 23 November. Yet major market indicators tell a more measured story. The S&P 500 has dipped roughly 5 percent from recent highs, suggesting turbulence but not the total global crash Kiyosaki describes.Kiyosaki has made bold crash forecasts repeatedly, including several in 2025 that did not unfold as predicted. His latest warning has sparked scepticism and online pushback, with figures like Grant Cardone publicly dismissing the claims. Still, the post taps into a broader and unresolved debate over AI’s economic impact and whether today’s volatility is a temporary shock or the beginning of something far more severe.","Robert Kiyosaki has reignited debate over his long-running market warnings.

India Says US Trade Deal Is 'Only Matter Of Time' As Tariffs Reshape Bilateral Trade Negotiations

US President Donald Trump on Saturday defended his sweeping tariff regime, saying the duties had made the country “Rich, Strong, Powerful, and Safe,” in a post on his Truth Social account.Trump argued that because of the tariff framework he “set in place,” the United States now holds “all the cards,” asserting that the measures had stopped wars, strengthened alliances and prevented other nations from “ripping off the United States anymore.”He claimed the stock market and retirement savings had surged, adding that “Inflation, Prices and Taxes are down,” and that education was “being brought back to the States.”Trump also said the US military and southern border were “the strongest they have ever been,” contending that the country is “respected again, respected like never before.”He attributed these outcomes to what he described as “Strong leadership and tariffs.”The president’s remarks come at a sensitive moment, as the Supreme Court is preparing to rule on the extent of presidential authority to impose duties without congressional approval.Tariff revenues have climbed sharply in recent months, as per Fox Business, reaching a record $34.2 billion in October.Total duty collections were $215.2 billion in fiscal year 2025, and the Treasury has reported $41.6 billion in revenue so far in fiscal 2026.Since Trump unveiled his “Liberation Day” tariffs in April, collections jumped from $23.9 billion in May to $29 billion in July, with August and September together bringing in $62.6 billion, reported Fox Business.US businesses pay these import taxes but often pass on the costs to consumers, though Trump has recently lifted some duties to ease price pressures.Trump has pledged that tariff revenues could finance a one-time $2,000 dividend for low- and middle-income households.As per Fox Business, US trade representative Jamieson Greer recently said that the payments would not fuel inflation, stressing they would provide “welcome relief” without altering the broader economic outlook.Trump ended his post by urging Americans to “pray to God” that the Supreme Court “do the right thing for America.”","US President Donald Trump on Saturday defended his sweeping tariff regime.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Explainer: What is 'Hindu rate of growth' and why Raghuram Rajan's remarks may be 'premature',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/explainer-what-is-hindu-rate-of-growth-and-why-raghuram-rajans-remarks-may-be-premature/articleshow/98482598.cms,"What is meant by Hindu growth rate

How India's GDP has been growing

What SBI report said on savings and investment

Incremental capital output ratio

NEW DELHI: India's gross domestic product (GDP) data for the third quarter (October-December 2022) received a word of caution from the former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan In an interview with news agency PTI, Rajan that India is ""dangerously close"" to the Hindu rate of growth in view of subdued private sector investment, high interest rates and slowing global growth.India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying"".However, a report released by the State Bank of India (SBI) economists on Tuesday dismissed arguments that India is dangerously close to Hindu rate of growth saying such statements are ""ill-conceived, biased and premature"".The term 'Hindu growth rate' was coined by late economist Raj Krishna in 1978 to describe the slow growth in the country.It basically refers to the low pace of economic growth rates during 1950s to 1980s. During this period, the Indian economy averaged 3.5%.A former lecturer at the Delhi School of Economics (DSE), Krishna noted that only if the rate of growth is persistently slow and accompanied by low per-capita GDP, then it will be known as Hindu rate of growth but it has to factor in population growth as well.Before economic reforms of 1991, India's economic growth remained stagnant and low, while per capita income averaged around 1.3%.Krishna termed this low growth situation to be a result of socialist policies of state control and import substitution.However, the economic situation changed when liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation (LPG) reforms came into effect in the year 1991, at a time when India faced balance of payment crisis.Over the years, many economists have strongly opposed the idea of 'Hindu growth rate' and the term never had universal acceptance.The Indian economy plunged into its very first technical recession in FY21 due to the impact of Covid-19 pandemic and the related nationwide lockdowns. GDP shrunk by an unprecedented 23.8% in the first quarter of the financial year 2020-21. However, due to spurt in economic activities in the subsequent quarters, the GDP decline started to narrow.However, if we look at the period before Covid-19 as well, India's growth curve shows a declining trend.From 8.26% in FY17, GDP growth plunged to 3.74% in FY20. Shutdown of economic activities in FY21 in wake of Covid-19 only made matters worse.As lockdowns started to ease and business activities resumed, India's GDP also started rising. In Q1 of FY22, growth jumped to 20.1% mainly on account of low base effect. By the fourth quarter of FY22, growth came down to 4.10%.Similarly, the new financial year 2022-23 brought fresh economic challenges in the form of Russia-Ukraine war that impacted almost all major economies of the world, slowed the pace of growth, pushed inflation to record highs.As a result, the central banks of all advanced economies spurred into action and opted for monetary policy tightening to curb the soaring inflation.With persistently rising interest rates, India's economy grew by 4.4% in Q3 of FY23, as the Centre revised upwards GDP growth for previous year to 9.10% from 8.7% earlier.The report weighed recent GDP numbers against the available data on savings and investments for the past decade and highlighted some interesting points.""Quarterly growth numbers are noisy and should be best avoided for any serious interpretation (on an average, India's GDP growth has witnessed Rs 2 lakh crore upward revision for the 3 year ended FY23),"" the report said.Gross capital formation (GCF) by the government touched a high of 11.8% in 2021-22, up from 10.7% in 2020-21.""This also had a domino effect on private sector investment that jumped from 10 per cent to 10.8% over the same period,"" it said.In fact, Ecowrap added that the trends in GCF to gross output ratio or the plough back of funds for creation of fresh capacity shows that for public administration the ratio attained fresh peak in 2021-22 owing to the emphasis on capital expenditure in recent budgets.At the aggregate level, gross capital formation is supposed to have crossed 32% in 2022-23, the highest level since 2018-19.According to the report, in 2021-22, gross savings have risen to 30% from 29% in 2020-21.""The ratio is supposed to have crossed 31 per cent in 2022-23, the highest since 2018-19. The household savings increased sharply during the pandemic period on account of sharp accretion in financial savings such as deposits,"" said the report by SBI's Economic Research Department.While household financial savings have since then moderated from 15.4% in 2020-21 to 11.1% in 2022-23, savings in physical assets have grown sharply to 11.8% in 2021-22 from 10.7% in 2020-21.The report further analysed Incremental Capital Output ratio (ICOR) -- which measures additional units of capital (investment) needed to produce additional units of output. It said that the ratio has been improving.""ICOR which was 7.5 in FY 12 is now only 3.5 in FY22. Clearly, only half of capital is now needed for next unit of output,"" the report noted.Such reducing ICOR in the current years reflects a relatively increasing efficiency of capital and shows that the economy is on a sound footing, the report said.""From that point of view, future GDP growth rates even at 7% could still mean a decent number by any standards!,"" it added.","India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.

An employee is entitled for a 50 per cent amount of the last drawn salary as pension.OPS was discontinued by the NDA government in 2003 with effect from April 1, 2004.Under the new pension scheme (NPS), employees contribute 10 per cent of their basic salary towards pension while the government contributes 14 per cent.Governments of Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand have informed the central government/ Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA about their decision to restart OPS for their employees.The government of Punjab on November 18, 2022, issued a notification regarding implementation of OPS for the state government employees who are being covered under NPS. Jharkhand too has decided to revert to OPS.",Former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan has expressed his concern over the decision of some states to restart the old pension scheme.

Pay via UPI in Qatar! India expands digital payment network; here's where you can use it,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/pay-via-upi-in-qatar-india-expands-digital-payment-network-heres-where-you-can-use-it/articleshow/124351206.cms,"



Shopping in Qatar but concerned about the payment method in a foreign land? Now you can use UPI to pay for your spree in this mall.India has expanded its digital payment network overseas, with the launching of the Unified Payment Interface (UPI) in Lulu Group’s Stores in Qatar.The move comes after its roll out at the duty-free outlets in Hamad International Airport.Commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal inaugurated the service at a Lulu store on Monday, calling it a key step in boosting financial flows between the two nations. He said that the integration will make transactions between the two nations smoother and more cost-effective.The launch follows a partnership between NPCI International Payments Ltd (NIPL), Qatar National Bank (QNB), and Japanese payment gateway NETSTARS.Earlier in September, NIPL and QNB introduced UPI at point-of-sale terminals across Qatar for merchants acquired by QNB.Goyal urged more financial institutions in Qatar to adopt the system.“The launch of UPI and UPI transactions is not just a digital payment solution, but has the potential to revolutionise trade between Qatar and India. It's an opportunity to expand our trust between the two nations because as we seamlessly integrate the payment systems of Qatar and India, our people will be able to trade more, trade smarter at lower cost,” he said.He also noted that the system enables near real-time transfers at a “very-very low” cost, which will make the movement of money and capital much faster.“Expanded trade will further be strengthened with the adoption of UPI ... I thank QNB for taking up UPI as part of their payment systems,” he added, describing the official launch as a milestone in the partnership.The new facility is also expected to benefit the 8.3 lakh (830,000) Indians living in Qatar by making their remittances quicker and cheaper.With this launch, Qatar has become the eighth country to accept UPI payments. The system will allow Indian travellers to pay in real time without using foreign currency or international cards, while also helping local Qatari businesses accept digital payments seamlessly.Goyal highlighted how UPI has transformed India’s payments landscape since its launch nine years ago.“85% of Indian digital payments go through UPI and nearly 50% of global digital payments are now made by UPI,” he said, adding that the platform processes around 640 million transactions daily.He further praised QNB for linking NIPL, the developer of the UPI platform, with Lulu Group, which is now offering UPI payments to all its customers in Qatar.","India has expanded its digital payment network overseas, with the launching of the Unified Payment Interface (UPI) in Lulu Group’s Stores in Qatar.

Gold prices are expected to maintain their bullish streak in the coming days with any dips offering an opportunity to buy, says Manav Modi, Senior Analyst, Commodity Research at Motilal Oswal Financial services Ltd. Here is his outlook for gold prices in the coming days:Gold prices are extending their impressive rally, briefly breaching the $3,900 mark for the first time, supported by robust safe-haven demand amid intensifying geopolitical and economic uncertainty. Silver followed closely, trading just shy of its all-time high on COMEX.Despite a slight uptick in the dollar index near 98, precious metals remained resilient, as markets fixated on the deepening US government shutdown, weaker labor data, and a rising probability of Federal Reserve rate cuts—now priced in at over 50% for both October and December. Physical demand was mixed; while China showed signs of softness, other Asian markets saw steady buying.Investor appetite remained strong, reflected in rising SPDR holdings, even as some profit-taking occurred. Political instability in Japan, where the yen plunged following the election of fiscal dove Sanae Takaichi, added to global risk sentiment. With the US shutdown now in its sixth day and key data releases at risk of delay, focus turns to next week’s FOMC minutes, Fed Chair Powell’s speech, and China’s post-holiday market movements.US shutdown is creating an unrest supporting safe haven buying. President Trump will have to convince and push through in parliament before major spill over effect on economy. Fed officials mixed comments regarding interest rates and rising rate cut expectations kept market on edge.Also, in the FOMC meeting minutes of September meeting where first rate cut was announced after eight months and dot plot was released will be interesting to see.","Gold prices are expected to maintain their bullish streak in the coming days with any dips offering an opportunity to buy, says Manav Modi, Senior Analyst, Commodity Research at Motilal Oswal Financial services Ltd.

"Bitcoin reaches all-time high! Largest crypto surpasses $125,000 mark; 'debasement’ trade spurs risk rally",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/bitcoin-reaches-all-time-high-largest-crypto-surpasses-125000-mark-debasement-trade-spurs-risk-rally/articleshow/124317019.cms,"



Bitcoin soared to a new all-time high on Sunday, breaking past the $125,000 mark as safe-haven demand surged.The world’s largest cryptocurrency reached $125,689 in Asia, driven by investor concerns over the US government shutdown. The cryptocurrency smashed its previous record of $124,514 set on August 14, boosted by gains in US stocks and fresh inflows into Bitcoin-linked exchange-traded funds.Investors believe that the government shutdown, which began on Wednesday, could push money into safe-haven assets, a trend market participants are calling the “debasement trade.”“With many assets including equities, gold and even collectibles like Pokemon cards hitting all time highs, it’s no surprise Bitcoin is benefitting from the dollar debasement narrative,” Joshua Lim, co-head of markets at crypto prime brokerage firm FalconX told Bloomberg.October is traditionally a strong month for Bitcoin, often referred to as “Uptober,” with the token gaining in nine of the past ten years. The surge this year has lifted Bitcoin’s value by more than 30%.The rise has also been fuelled by growing corporate adoption. Public companies, led by Michael Saylor’s Strategy, have been stockpiling Bitcoin, a move that has inspired other firms and even boosted interest in smaller digital assets like Ether.US equities hit record highs on Friday, driven by major artificial intelligence deals and partnerships, easing concerns about a prolonged shutdown and weak business activity.Meanwhile, treasuries and the dollar fell, and gold was on track for a seventh consecutive weekly gain, supported by central bank buying amid low interest rates and persistent inflation worries.“The shutdown matters this time around,” said Geoff Kendrick, global head of digital assets research at Standard Chartered Plc, as quoted by Bloomberg.He added that Bitcoin is likely to rise during this period and noted that the cryptocurrency was “in a different place” during the previous shutdown in 2018-2019, when it did not move in line with traditional risk assets.","World's largest cryptocurrency smashed its previous record of $124,514 set on August 14.

The TOI correspondent from Washington:

Pak PM Sharif And Munir Face Backlash After Rare Earth Shipment To US, Ex-PM's Party Questions Deal





In a shifty effort to put on a solid footing a relationship with Washington that was on the rocks for almost two decades, Pakistan has exported the first consignment of minerals purportedly containing rare earths to the US.The Pakistan government revealed over the weekend that in a “historic milestone for bilateral cooperation,” it has “successfully delivered its first batch of enriched rare earth elements and critical minerals” to US Strategic Metals (USSM), a private company in Missouri with which one of its state-owned entities had signed a $ 500 million partnership early September.The export follows a presentation the Pakistan’s hybrid military-civilian leadership made to President Trump in the White House late last month. China has a near monopoly over export of rare earth elements, vital in a range of industries from automobiles to rocketry to advanced computing, and the US is trying to overcome Beijing’s stranglehold.""Today, Pakistan steps forward as a credible and trusted partner in building secure and diversified supply chains for the future of our two nations."" Pakistan’s Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif was quoted as saying by the PR Newswire, an agency that distributes content for a fee.It disclosed that “In this first shipment, Pakistan has indigenously sourced and prepared: Antimony, Copper concentrate; and rare earth elements with neodymium and praseodymium. ”However, the PR appeared to be more optics than based on reality. Neodymium and praseodymium are primarily present in the form of compounds within specific minerals. They are almost never found as pure, free metals. It takes years, even decades to separate, and refine rare earth elements (REEs) from their mineral ores (which is what Pakistan has sent).Even the US does not have full self-sufficiency in the entire rare earth supply chain. Only one American company, MP Materials, which operates the Mountain Pass Mine in California, is reported to run an active rare earth mine in the country, and even it exports concentrates to China for final processing. Only after the current tariff fiasco which resulted in China cutting off rare earths to America has the US embarked on a ""mine-to-magnet"" domestic supply chain, and even that is expected to take years to develop. Some estimates put this at 10 to 20 years.Still, the press release talked up the “strategic and economic significance,” for Pakistan’s from its entry into the global minerals supply chain, with the potential to generate billions in revenues, large-scale job creation, and technology transfer, adding that Pakistan’s natural resources are estimated at around 6 Trillion USD making it one of the largest precious metals and rare earth minerals on the world.For the United States, it is a strategic safeguard ensuring resilience and independence from external monopolies, while securing vital inputs for its defense, energy, and high-tech sectors, Pakistan said through the PR agency.""We see this as the first step in our exciting journey together with the Frontier Works Organisation (FWO) of Pakistan, to provide critical minerals to the United States and bolster economic trade and friendship between our two countries,"" Stacy W. Hastie, CEO of USSM, was quoted as saying.The agreement between USSM and FWO creates a framework for joint development of the entire mineral value chain—including exploration, beneficiation, concentrate production, and eventual establishment of refineries in Pakistan, it said, adding that “with this first delivery completed and a multi-phase investment framework underway, Pakistan is now positioned as a rising force in the global critical minerals economy—and a long-term partner to the United States. ”","Pakistan has exported the first consignment of minerals purportedly containing rare earths to the US.

Tariff refund nightmare

More than half of tariff revenue at risk of refund

Tariff collections: Trump admin may not let go easily





Donald Trump administration’s tariff collections - running into billions of dollars - is threatened in case the Supreme Court decides to strike down the US President’s tariff policies. Trump himself has warned that any decision against his tariff policies would spell disaster.Businesses, which have paid huge amounts in the last few months due to country-based tariffs, believe that getting back refunds in case the tariffs are deemed illegal by the Supreme Court, would be a nightmare.To begin with, this would create administrative challenges involving extensive refund processing. If these nation-specific tariffs are ruled unlawful, the United States might need to return most of the $165 billion in customs duties collected in the current fiscal year to the businesses that paid them, according to a Bloomberg report.However, obtaining refunds will be complicated; reimbursements typically come via paper cheques through a slow process, and whilst the government could expedite mass repayments, experts believe this is doubtful.""The customs authorities won't simply distribute refunds to importers freely,"" Lynlee Brown, global trade partner at EY was quoted as saying by Bloomberg.The uncertainty surrounding the potential refund process exemplifies the broader confusion that businesses and financial markets have experienced since the implementation of Trump's tariff policies.Several importers have abandoned expectations of receiving reimbursements, even if the court rules in their favour.""I have zero faith we'd ever get anything. Just zero,"" expressed Harley Sitner, who owns Peace Vans, a Seattle-based classic camper van repair and restoration business.Sitner told Bloomberg that the unpredictability of Trump's trade policies is more problematic than the actual tariff payments, which he views as irretrievable expenses. Following unexpected tariff charges ranging from $221 to $17,000, sometimes arriving months after receiving goods, Sitner has discontinued importing international inventory.""Just yesterday we got a small shipment from Germany worth $2,324 and it came with a $1,164 tariff charge. We can't back out,"" Sitner stated.Various customs brokers report being approached by Wall Street organisations interested in purchasing rights to potential refunds, offering importers an opportunity to recover a portion of their possible entitlements.The significant increase in customs duties - a rise of $95 billion compared to the previous year - is primarily attributed to Trump's import tariffs affecting multiple economies, which became effective in August, as analysed by Bloomberg Economics. Two lower judicial bodies have ruled that Trump lacked the authority to implement tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.Should the Supreme Court uphold these earlier decisions, approximately 50% of the customs duties collected by the United States this year could be subject to refund. However, the process for businesses to reclaim these funds remains uncertain. Despite the government shutdown, tariff-related operations have largely continued uninterrupted.The United States Customs and Border Protection regularly processes refunds for importers in cases of overpayment or regulatory changes, with the Treasury Department issuing the payments. However, this reimbursement process is not automatically initiated.In line with statutory requirements, importers and their customs brokers must adhere to precise timelines and documentation procedures to maintain eligibility for refunds. Currently, the system predominantly relies on paper cheques for disbursement.Despite the Treasury's directive from the Trump administration to discontinue cheque payments by September 30, the Customs and Border Protection (CBP) only initiated its first phase last Tuesday in what will be an extended implementation process. The system's completion before any court decision appears unlikely without accelerated efforts.Tom Gould, a customs consultant from Seattle, suggests that potential refunds might result in ""it's possible that we'll see millions and millions of paper checks being mailed out because each shipment, each customs entry, will have its own.""The process could be problematic. According to the Bloomberg report, due to regulatory requirements, customs refunds are exclusively sent to sanctioned domestic banks in dollars, requiring foreign importers to receive their refunds through international postal services or utilise a broker's account within the United States.Worryingly, there has been a series of stolen cheque incidents in recent years. According to Gould, refund cheques were intercepted during postal delivery and traded on the dark web before being encashed.The administration possesses various options to expedite refunds, including automated processing of claims using existing system data. CBP has previously implemented refund rationalisation measures.Customs officials developed a framework to facilitate refund disbursement for items eligible under duty exemptions through the Generalised System of Preferences. Despite Congress allowing this programme to expire multiple times since the 1980s, it was subsequently renewed retroactively.Importers would input specific codes indicating GSP eligibility, even during programme inactivity. Gould suggested that the agency could similarly analyse internal data to identify IEEPA code-related tariff payments.Alternative procedures exist, though they might be complex. Legal experts indicate individual importers could be compelled to initiate separate legal proceedings to recover their funds.The authorities might require submission of protests or post-summary amendments, accompanied by comprehensive payment documentation and importer records, despite the government already possessing this information.EY's Brown recommends importers maintain complete records from CBP's Automated Commercial Environment platform, documenting entry dates and deadlines systematically to enhance refund possibilities.Despite potential simplified procedures by CBP, the complex nature of financial transactions within supply chains presents additional challenges.For shipments managed through commercial carriers like FedEx Corp. and United Parcel Service Inc., who handle documentation and tariff payments, CBP would direct refunds to the registered importer - the courier service rather than the goods' owner.This arrangement could generate complications between the actual importers and courier services, creating another obstacle for businesses seeking reimbursement.Trump has valued the tariff income, declaring it has restored national wealth. He and his supporters have suggested various uses for these funds, including reducing national debt, supporting struggling agricultural sectors, and potentially distributing payment cheques to US citizens.This suggests the Trump administration will be reluctant to release these funds if the tariffs are invalidated, and they are likely to swiftly implement new levies using alternative legal frameworks should this occur. The Supreme Court is scheduled to review arguments in November regarding this matter.","Businesses have paid huge amounts in the last few months due to country-based tariffs.

US stock markets began the trading day on a positive note this Monday, extending the previous week's upward momentum. The rally was primarily driven by AMD's artificial intelligence partnership with OpenAI , which helped overshadow worries about an extended US government shutdown.At market opening, the Dow Jones Industrial Average edged up by 17.8 points, reaching 46,776.04, a 0.04% increase. The S&P 500 advanced by 18.1 points to 6,733.86, marking a 0.27% gain, whilst the Nasdaq Composite climbed 113.8 points to 22,894.352, representing a 0.50% rise.Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and OpenAI announced a multi-year partnership to develop AI data centers, a deal AMD says could generate tens of billions of dollars in new revenue over the next five years. AMD share prices soared, rising from the previous close of $164.67 to Monday opening of $226.32, a surge of around 37 per cent, after the announcement of its multi-year partnership with OpenAI, following the news, which involves supplying OpenAI with six gigawatts of GPUs critical for AI development.The move allows OpenAI to diversify its semiconductor supply beyond US rival Nvidia, which signed a $100 billion equipment contract with the AI company in late September. Analysts note that AMD faces competition from Nvidia, China’s Huawei, and tech giants Amazon and Google. As part of the agreement, AMD will issue OpenAI 160 million warrants, financial instruments that can be converted into shares under specific conditions.This surge comes despite economic concerns remain over the shutdown of the US government since October 1.","Dow Jones Industrial Average rose by 17.8 points, reaching 46,776.04.

"Crude oil: Opec+ to raise production by 137,000 bpd from November; group stays cautious amid supply glut fears",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/crude-oil-opec-to-raise-production-by-137000-bpd-from-november-group-stays-cautious-amid-supply-glut-fears/articleshow/124321345.cms,"



Saudi Arabia, Russia and six other members of Opec+ on Sunday decided to raise their oil production quotas by 137,000 barrels per day (bpd) for November, continuing efforts to reclaim market share amid cautious demand projections, AFP reported.“In view of a steady global economic outlook and current healthy market fundamentals, as reflected in the low oil inventories, the eight participating countries decided to implement a production adjustment of 137 thousand barrels per day from October’s levels,” Opec+ said in a statement after an online meeting.The increase was lower than many analysts had anticipated, with the group seeking to avoid exerting downward pressure on prices amid weak global demand. “Opec+8 stepped carefully after witnessing how nervous the market had become in light of rumours that production could be hiked by 500,000 barrels a day,” said Jorge Leon, analyst at Rystad Energy. “The group is walking a tightrope between maintaining stability and clawing back market share in a surplus environment. ”Since April, the eight members — Saudi Arabia, Russia, Iraq, the UAE, Kuwait, Kazakhstan, Oman, and Algeria — have already raised their quotas by more than 2.5 million bpd.The initial focus of Opec+ this year was to support high prices by limiting supply, but the strategy shifted in April to prioritise regaining market share from competitors including the US, Brazil, Canada, Guyana and Argentina.Global oil demand projections are modest. The International Energy Agency expects consumption to rise by only 700,000 bpd between 2025 and 2026, while Opec forecasts higher growth of 1.3 million bpd in 2025 and 1.4 million bpd in 2026.Brent crude, the global benchmark, traded below $65 per barrel on Friday, down about 8% in a week amid concerns over a potential surge in Opec+ production.Russia, the cartel’s second-largest producer after Saudi Arabia, relies on high oil prices to fund its war effort in Ukraine but has limited capacity to increase output due to US and European sanctions. “The increase decided Sunday is manageable for Russia,” said Leon. The country currently produces around 9.25 million bpd, close to its maximum capacity of 9.45 million bpd, down from roughly 10 million before the conflict, analysts said.Ukrainian strikes on Russian refineries since August have intensified exports, as domestic utilisation of crude has declined, making Russia even more dependent on foreign markets, said Arne Lohmann Rasmussen, analyst at Global Risk Management","Saudi Arabia, Russia and six other members of Opec+ on Sunday decided to raise their oil production quotas by 137,000 barrels per day for November.

US To Abandon H1-B Visa Lottery System, Trump Floats More Changes To Rules | Detailed Report





The Indian diaspora is actively discussing the first lawsuit filed recently against President Trump’s proclamation, which has slapped an entry fee of $ 100K on all new H-1B visa petitions filed after the specified date of September 21.Also read: Cross section of organisations sue to halt Trump’s $100K entry fee for new H-1B applications In social media forums, the Indian plaintiff who is a party to the first lawsuit to challenge the entry fee is being hailed as a hero for stepping forward to challenge Trump’s proclamation. The clock is ticking for this post-doctoral researcher at a US university, as her employer has paused her H-1B cap-exempt sponsorship.As TOI had reported earlier, while the entry fee kicks in for new H-1B cap applications in the next lottery season (Spring 2026), the immediate impact will be felt by those employers (such as Universities, non-profit entities affiliated with universities, non-profit research organisations) that are eligible to hire cap-exempt employees – many of whom cannot afford this steep fee.Also read: Relief for current H-1B employees but a blow to future hiring She is one of the many plaintiffs, others include a cross section of organisations representing health care providers, academicians, educational institutions, and religious organisations. The only other individual who is contesting this joint lawsuit is a UK national.The woman has filed the lawsuit under a pseudonym ‘Phoenix Doe’. She has been identified in the lawsuit only as “a citizen of India residing in the Northern District of California”.Her work explores the genetic and epigenetic causes of vision loss from ageing, diabetes and rare inherited disorders, aiming to improve diagnosis and treatment of blinding conditions.According to the lawsuit, she is the lab’s first post-doctoral scholar and is critical to building its research programme; her project requires at least two more years. Valued for her combined expertise in computational biology and bench research, she had been approved for H-1B sponsorship and expected to finalise the process by December — which would have allowed her to visit India for the first time in six years.Instead, the university has indefinitely paused her H-1B application, leaving her in limbo. In the lawsuit, she submits that the uncertainty has caused her severe stress and anxiety, aggravating her post traumatic stress disorder. Without judicial relief she will have to leave her position within four months. Her exit, it points out, would derail crucial eye-disease research, disrupt the lab’s funding prospects and delay progress toward new treatments.The lawsuit submits that by slapping an unlawful $100K price tag on every new H-1B petition, the government has effectively barred many US employers from sponsoring foreign professionals like her.The Indian plaintiff’s ordeal is emblematic of the toll the proclamation and shifting immigration policies take on families and communities.The lawsuit seeks an injunction halting the fee’s enforcement, a declaration that the order is unlawful, and a return to the original statutory H-1B framework (without imposition of the entry fee).The case has drawn attention in India — home to the largest share of H-1B talent — as it could determine whether professionals like the unnamed plaintiff can continue contributing to the US workforce without prohibitive costs hanging over their visas.","The Indian diaspora is actively discussing the first lawsuit filed against President Trump’s proclamation, which has slapped an entry fee of $ 100K on all new H-1B visa petitions filed after the specified date of September 21.

Why is Musk not watching Netflix?

Profits





Shares of streaming platform Netflix have tumbled almost 5% over the past 5 trading sessions ever since Tesla CEO Elon Musk has started urging his followers to boycott the company and cancel their subscriptions.Netflix shares fell on Friday, marking their biggest weekly decline since April, even as the broader market rallied. Though major indices rose about 2% to new highs, the streaming giant lagged behind tech peers like Amazon (AMZN) and Meta (META), according to Yahoo Finance.Musk has used his platform on X to call on consumers to cancel their Netflix subscriptions, criticising the company for including alleged transgender messaging in children’s programming.This week, Elon Musk urged his followers to cancel their Netflix subscriptions amid a controversy surrounding an animated show and its creator.Musk posted on X, “Cancel Netflix for the health of your kids.” His post responded to an image claiming Netflix was promoting a “transgender woke agenda.”The backlash centres on the animated Netflix series Dead End: Paranormal Park, which featured a transgender character and was cancelled in 2023 after two seasons.In addition to sharing several anti-trans posts, Musk also reacted to a post criticising alleged statements by the show’s creator, Hamish Steele, which a prominent conservative X account said “mocked” the murder of activist Charlie Kirk.The post came after Libs of TikTok shared screenshots from a Netflix report showing a rise in non-white directors and lead actors across its programmes.Netflix is preparing to release its third-quarter earnings later this month. The short-term effect of the boycott may be hard to gauge, as the company no longer reports subscriber numbers every quarter.In its most recent report, Netflix beat Wall Street expectations and raised its full-year revenue forecast. The company expects third-quarter revenue of $11.53 billion and earnings per share of $6.87, above analysts’ initial estimates. For the full year, Netflix now projects revenue between $44.8 billion and $45.2 billion, boosted by ad-supported tier growth, favourable foreign exchange movements, and steady user engagement.Executives have said ad sales are on track to roughly double to $3 billion next year, with new seasons of hit shows such as Wednesday, Stranger Things, and Squid Game, alongside expanded live sports offerings, expected to maintain momentum.Netflix has weathered similar controversies in the past. In 2020, the film Cuties sparked bipartisan outrage over alleged sexualisation of children, leading to a surge in cancellations. Yet the company managed to maintain its subscriber base and continued growing in the following years.","Netflix shares fell on Friday, marking their biggest weekly decline since April.

H-1B visa fee hike: Businesses warn changes would harm US economy; urge Trump admin for employer friendly reforms,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/h-1b-visa-fee-hike-businesses-warn-changes-would-harm-us-economy-urge-trump-admin-for-employer-friendly-reforms/articleshow/124315755.cms,"H-1B Visa Shock Explained: $100K Annual Fee Announced by Donald Trump





Business groups have raised concerns over US President Donald Trump ’s decision to impose a $100,000 fee on H-1B visa applications, warning that the move could hurt the US economy. They also called on the administration to avoid changing the skilled worker program that would add even more burden to companies.In a letter to Donald Trump on Friday, nearly a dozen trade associations representing chipmakers, software firms, and retailers warned that the hefty fee could disrupt a crucial flow of foreign talent and leave essential positions vacant.“We ask the administration to work with industry on necessary reforms to the H-1B visa program without increasing the significant challenges US employers face recruiting, training, and retaining top talent,” they wrote.The signatories included the Business Software Alliance, SEMI, the National Retail Federation, the Entertainment Software Association and the Information Technology Industry Council, according to Bloomberg.The letter came two weeks after Trump’s proclamation on H-1B changes and also acknowledged his efforts to boost investment in the US.The H-1B fee announcement marked one of the first major confrontations between the new administration and corporate America.Trump unveiled the change at the White House last month, saying the hefty charge would curb misuse of the visa programme and encourage companies to rely more on American workers.A White House spokesperson defended the decision, claiming it would strengthen the programme by allowing companies to hire top talent and reducing “fraudulent practices by bad-faith actors.”“Widespread visa abuse not only undermines American workers, but undermines the companies” that need to recruit first-class talent, White House spokesman Kush Desai said, as quoted by Bloomberg.Sharp rise in costs will hit sectors ranging from technology and healthcare to finance, where companies such as Microsoft, Amazon and Walmart have long depended on foreign professionals to fill technical roles.They warned that fast-growing fields like artificial intelligence and biomedical engineering rely on highly skilled workers to maintain their pace of development. Members of SEMI’s board include Intel, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., Samsung Electronics, Applied Materials and KLA.“The new approach to H-1B visas, as it stands, will harm the Administration’s goals to ensure the US remains a leader in AI, revitalizes manufacturing growth, and propels US-developed energy,” the letter said, as cited by Bloomberg.Retail giants Walmart, Target and Macy’s are represented on the NRF’s executive committee and board. Following the announcement, several large companies advised H-1B visa holders not to travel abroad to avoid complications.Copies of the letter were also sent to homeland security secretary Kristi Noem, commerce secretary Howard Lutnick and secretary of state Marco Rubio.The policy faced its first legal challenge on Friday, when a nurse-staffing agency and several unions filed a lawsuit in federal court seeking to block the fee.

Wall Street rally: US market surging despite US gov shutdown concerns; here is what to look for,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/wall-street-rally-us-market-surging-despite-us-gov-shutdown-concerns-here-is-what-to-look-for/articleshow/124316557.cms,"Stocks get costlier!

What to look for



Corporate profits

Interest rate cuts

AI optimism





Investors were bracing for turbulence on Wall Street as the US government shutdown delayed key economic reports. Yet, defying expectations, the stock market surged on Friday, with both the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average hitting record highs.The rally isn’t just driven by Big Tech. Though companies like Nvidia, riding the AI boom, are still performing strongly, gains are widespread across the US stock market, according to AP.Smaller companies are also thriving: the Russell 2000 index has hit a record after taking nearly four years to recover its previous peak. Gold has reached new highs, and the most popular US bond fund is on track for its strongest year in at least five.Historically, shutdowns have had little impact on markets or the broader economy, and investors expect a similar outcome this time. Many professional investors believe the market could continue to rise, even after a 35% increase since April.But if the shutdown is not hitting the market, what may impact it?Despite the optimism, some experts worry that stocks are getting expensive. Though stock prices follow the company’s profit, lately they have surged much faster than corporate profits, and the S&P 500 is now close to its priciest level since the 2000 dot-com bubble, according to the Shiller price-to-earnings ratio, which measures valuations over the past decade.Ann Miletti, head of equity investments at Allspring Global Investments, says she’s concerned about speculative stocks, especially smaller, unprofitable companies. “It’s these little bubbles that are concerning to me. When you see things like this, it’s generally not a good thing,” she said, though she remained relatively optimistic about 2026.It is worth noting that indicators of an overvalued market are notoriously unreliable in predicting downturns. Stocks can remain pricey for some time as long as investors are willing to pay the premium, AP reported.Looking ahead, the upcoming earnings season will be closely watched. PepsiCo and Delta Air Lines will release results on Thursday, followed by major banks like JPMorgan Chase.Analysts expect the S&P 500 to report an 8% growth in earnings per share compared with last year, with companies needing to show continued growth through 2025 and into 2026 despite inflation, tariffs, and economic uncertainty.Another factor behind the rally is the expectation of interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. Lower rates make borrowing cheaper for businesses and households, boost spending, and make investors willing to pay more for stocks and bonds.Traders expect at least three more rate cuts by mid-next year, with Fed officials signalling a possible easing as the job market slows. But Chair Jerome Powell has warned that the Fed may adjust plans if inflation, which remains above the 2% target, persists.“I feel like interest rates and expectations of what the Fed is going to do are driving everything right now,” said Miletti. “If the Fed doesn’t cut as much as people are expecting, any of these areas that look a little speculative, because they’re not based on fundamentals, those areas will have some real problems.”Yung-Yu Ma, chief investment strategist at PNC Asset Management Group, calls AI “the question of the decade.” He believes AI-related stocks are fairly valued as long as the sector continues strong growth and sales, as cited by AP.The AI boom is also helping to ease concerns about long-term interest rates and inflation. But for the benefits to last, AI must improve productivity enough to counter the rising debt levels in the US and globally.“If we do achieve these benefits for companies and for people's lives, everything can go well for years,” said Ma. “I think everyone is tying their fortunes to that ship, whether they realize it or not.”",The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average hit record highs on Friday.

US government to auction 600 million tonnes of coal: Who will buy? Climate concerns also loom,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-government-to-auction-600-million-tonnes-of-coal-who-will-buy-climate-concerns-loom/articleshow/124308141.cms,"Image used for representative purposes

Who will buy the coal?





In the coming days, US authorities will conduct the nation’s largest coal auctions in over a decade, offering 600 million tonnes from state-owned reserves adjacent to strip mines in Montana and Wyoming. The leases, located in the Powder River Basin—the country’s most productive coal region—were expedited following a January executive order by President Donald Trump.While the auctions align with Trump’s goal of increasing coal extraction from federal lands for power generation, an Associated Press analysis shows that many power stations served by these mines plan to stop using coal within a decade.The forthcoming sales will go ahead despite the government shutdown, as workers handling fossil fuel permits and leases are exempt from furlough. Then-President Biden had attempted to block future coal leases in the region last year, citing climate change concerns. According to the Department of Energy, burning coal from these leases could generate over 1 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide.Interior Secretary Doug Burgum announced that more than 20,000 square miles of federal lands would be opened for mining—an area larger than New Hampshire and Vermont combined.The administration has also reduced federal coal royalty rates, extended a Michigan coal plant’s operation, and allocated $625 million for plant modernisation, citing rising electricity demand from AI and data centres. ""We're putting American miners back to work,"" Burgum said. ""We've got a demand curve coming at us in terms of the demand for electricity that is literally going through the roof.""The key question remains: who will actually purchase this coal? Data from the US Energy Information Administration and Global Energy Monitor indicate declining demand for the mines slated for expansion or new leases, as power stations reduce coal consumption or plan to cease operations entirely.The administration’s aggressive push for coal—a major driver of climate change—raises pressing questions. It also points to the uncertainty of implementing such policies in markets where energy producers make long-term decisions with significant consequences, not only for their own operations but for the planet’s future, amid a constantly shifting political landscape.Montana and Wyoming sales were requested by Navajo Transitional Energy Co. (NTEC), which acquired several Powder River Basin mines in a 2019 bankruptcy auction. These mines supply 34 power stations across 19 states, but 21 of these stations plan to stop using coal within a decade, including all five served by NTEC’s Spring Creek mine in Montana.In government filings, NTEC valued 167 million tonnes of federal coal near Spring Creek at around $126,000—less than one-tenth of a penny per tonne, far below historical prices. NTEC justified the low valuation, citing forecasts of declining coal demand:""The market for coal will decline significantly over the next two decades. There are fewer coal mines expanding their reserves, there are fewer buyers of thermal coal and there are more regulatory constraints.""The government will auction 440 million tonnes near NTEC's Antelope Mine in central Wyoming on Wednesday. Over half of the 29 power stations served by this mine plan to cease coal use by 2035, including Colorado’s Rawhide plant, which is scheduled to switch from coal to natural gas and 30 megawatts of solar power by 2029.Peabody Energy, the largest US coal company, offers a more optimistic outlook. They estimate coal demand could increase by 250 million tonnes annually, nearly 50 per cent above current levels, citing delays in new nuclear and gas facilities. ""US coal is clearly in comeback mode,"" said Peabody president James Grech. ""The US has more energy in its coal reserves than any nation has in any one energy source.""Energy specialists remain sceptical. Umed Paliwal, an electricity market specialist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, said:""Eventually coal will get pushed out of the market. The economics will just eat the coal generation over time.""No major coal power stations have opened in the US since 2013, and most existing facilities are over 40 years old. Experts suggest the administration’s $625 million modernisation fund may be insufficient, with a single boiler component costing up to $25 million, according to GridLab energy consultant Nikhil Kumar.","US authorities will conduct the nation’s largest coal auctions in over a decade.

Billion dollar boost loading? Why Taylor Swift’s The Life of a Showgirl album may be just what US Fed & Powell needed,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/billion-dollar-boost-loading-why-taylor-swifts-the-life-of-a-showgirl-album-may-be-just-what-us-fed-powell-needed-explained/articleshow/124294382.cms,"The Life of a Showgirl (Image courtesy: Taylor Swift Instagram)

Taylor Swift’s new album - Booster shot loading for the US economy?

US Federal Reserve’s challenges





The US economy is faced with the twin conundrum - growth challenges are mounting, and inflation is not in the US Federal Reserve’s comfort zone. At such a time, the release of Taylor Swift ’s latest album, The Life of a Showgirl, may spell good news for the central bank!Now, what does the release of a music album by a famous singer have to do with the economic decisions of the US Federal Reserve and its chair Jerome Powell? Confused? We explain.Taylor Swift has released her latest studio album, marking her twelfth record. Should this launch lead to another extensive concert tour, it would positively impact the economic objectives of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and fellow policymakers.According to a report by Barron’s, the last time Taylor Swift did a mega-tour, it resulted in a possible boost for the US economy. The economic influence of the Eras Tour, comprising 149 performances across five continents, remains challenging to quantify precisely. Nevertheless, various analyses indicate substantial economic effects. Nomura's economists calculated that the initial US portion of the tour stimulated consumer expenditure of $5 billion, including ticket sales and accommodation costs, the Barron’s report said.The Life of a Showgirl was unveiled early Friday. According to music analytics platform Chartmetric, the album achieved an unprecedented milestone by surpassing 5 million pre-saves on Spotify.Those attempting to capitalise on the release through stock investments might face disappointment, the report said. Universal Music Group, which owns Swift's label Republic Records, receives a portion of streaming and publishing earnings. However, the company's potential earnings might be restricted as Swift maintains ownership of her master recordings.Despite Target keeping numerous stores open until midnight for fans to purchase both regular and exclusive CD versions, their shares increased by merely 0.1% on Friday. The S&P 500 index recorded a 0.2% rise.However, Barron's report notes that the market cannot disregard The Life of a Showgirl entirely. The crucial consideration for investors centres on whether Swift will launch another extensive tour following this album.A multi-billion dollar economic stimulus, brought on as a result of a mega tour like last time, would be beneficial in the current climate, the report said.With employment figures declining whilst inflation exceeds 2%, the Federal Reserve faces significant challenges. Market analysts anticipate the central bank will implement interest rate reductions this month, followed by additional cuts in December, aiming to support employment levels.“The Committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate and judges that downside risks to employment have risen,” the FOMC statement said.Should The Life of a Showgirl generate a touring schedule comparable to Eras, Powell may have Swift to thank!","Taylor Swift has released her latest studio album, marking her twelfth record.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor ( CEA ) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran Udaan until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.Udaan built an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business still accounts for a very small part of India’s overall retail market but can balloon to $150 billion in sales and yield a 100% return on capital invested in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co. estimates published in the Mint newspaper.Bengaluru-based Udaan has also ventured into financing through its fintech unit which helps shopkeepers get working capital loans to buy inventory. That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says.

SAR imagery provides much higher resolution than other forms of remote sensing technology such as hyperspectral and multispectral. SAR is a critical technology for strategic reconnaissance and planning as well as for disaster management.According to Misra, winning the challenge in just over a year of floating the company is a major booster.He said L and P band SAR have an advantage over other frequencies (like X band) when it comes to penetration capabilities through rain, clouds, foliage and vegetation in a tropical country like India, and underground penetration capabilities in dry terrain.Continuing further, he said the L band SAR will provide 1 metre resolution, spotlight resolution in Stripmap mode. The current industry standard is 5-10 metre in L band. Misra said both the L and P band will operate simultaneously from a satellite borne SAR.

Explainer: What is 'Hindu rate of growth' and why Raghuram Rajan's remarks may be 'premature',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/explainer-what-is-hindu-rate-of-growth-and-why-raghuram-rajans-remarks-may-be-premature/articleshow/98482598.cms,"What is meant by Hindu growth rate

How India's GDP has been growing

What SBI report said on savings and investment

Incremental capital output ratio

NEW DELHI: India's gross domestic product (GDP) data for the third quarter (October-December 2022) received a word of caution from the former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan In an interview with news agency PTI, Rajan that India is ""dangerously close"" to the Hindu rate of growth in view of subdued private sector investment, high interest rates and slowing global growth.India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying"".However, a report released by the State Bank of India (SBI) economists on Tuesday dismissed arguments that India is dangerously close to Hindu rate of growth saying such statements are ""ill-conceived, biased and premature"".The term 'Hindu growth rate' was coined by late economist Raj Krishna in 1978 to describe the slow growth in the country.It basically refers to the low pace of economic growth rates during 1950s to 1980s. During this period, the Indian economy averaged 3.5%.A former lecturer at the Delhi School of Economics (DSE), Krishna noted that only if the rate of growth is persistently slow and accompanied by low per-capita GDP, then it will be known as Hindu rate of growth but it has to factor in population growth as well.Before economic reforms of 1991, India's economic growth remained stagnant and low, while per capita income averaged around 1.3%.Krishna termed this low growth situation to be a result of socialist policies of state control and import substitution.However, the economic situation changed when liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation (LPG) reforms came into effect in the year 1991, at a time when India faced balance of payment crisis.Over the years, many economists have strongly opposed the idea of 'Hindu growth rate' and the term never had universal acceptance.The Indian economy plunged into its very first technical recession in FY21 due to the impact of Covid-19 pandemic and the related nationwide lockdowns. GDP shrunk by an unprecedented 23.8% in the first quarter of the financial year 2020-21. However, due to spurt in economic activities in the subsequent quarters, the GDP decline started to narrow.However, if we look at the period before Covid-19 as well, India's growth curve shows a declining trend.From 8.26% in FY17, GDP growth plunged to 3.74% in FY20. Shutdown of economic activities in FY21 in wake of Covid-19 only made matters worse.As lockdowns started to ease and business activities resumed, India's GDP also started rising. In Q1 of FY22, growth jumped to 20.1% mainly on account of low base effect. By the fourth quarter of FY22, growth came down to 4.10%.Similarly, the new financial year 2022-23 brought fresh economic challenges in the form of Russia-Ukraine war that impacted almost all major economies of the world, slowed the pace of growth, pushed inflation to record highs.As a result, the central banks of all advanced economies spurred into action and opted for monetary policy tightening to curb the soaring inflation.With persistently rising interest rates, India's economy grew by 4.4% in Q3 of FY23, as the Centre revised upwards GDP growth for previous year to 9.10% from 8.7% earlier.The report weighed recent GDP numbers against the available data on savings and investments for the past decade and highlighted some interesting points.""Quarterly growth numbers are noisy and should be best avoided for any serious interpretation (on an average, India's GDP growth has witnessed Rs 2 lakh crore upward revision for the 3 year ended FY23),"" the report said.Gross capital formation (GCF) by the government touched a high of 11.8% in 2021-22, up from 10.7% in 2020-21.""This also had a domino effect on private sector investment that jumped from 10 per cent to 10.8% over the same period,"" it said.In fact, Ecowrap added that the trends in GCF to gross output ratio or the plough back of funds for creation of fresh capacity shows that for public administration the ratio attained fresh peak in 2021-22 owing to the emphasis on capital expenditure in recent budgets.At the aggregate level, gross capital formation is supposed to have crossed 32% in 2022-23, the highest level since 2018-19.According to the report, in 2021-22, gross savings have risen to 30% from 29% in 2020-21.""The ratio is supposed to have crossed 31 per cent in 2022-23, the highest since 2018-19. The household savings increased sharply during the pandemic period on account of sharp accretion in financial savings such as deposits,"" said the report by SBI's Economic Research Department.While household financial savings have since then moderated from 15.4% in 2020-21 to 11.1% in 2022-23, savings in physical assets have grown sharply to 11.8% in 2021-22 from 10.7% in 2020-21.The report further analysed Incremental Capital Output ratio (ICOR) -- which measures additional units of capital (investment) needed to produce additional units of output. It said that the ratio has been improving.""ICOR which was 7.5 in FY 12 is now only 3.5 in FY22. Clearly, only half of capital is now needed for next unit of output,"" the report noted.Such reducing ICOR in the current years reflects a relatively increasing efficiency of capital and shows that the economy is on a sound footing, the report said.""From that point of view, future GDP growth rates even at 7% could still mean a decent number by any standards!,"" it added.","India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.

An employee is entitled for a 50 per cent amount of the last drawn salary as pension.OPS was discontinued by the NDA government in 2003 with effect from April 1, 2004.Under the new pension scheme (NPS), employees contribute 10 per cent of their basic salary towards pension while the government contributes 14 per cent.Governments of Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand have informed the central government/ Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA about their decision to restart OPS for their employees.The government of Punjab on November 18, 2022, issued a notification regarding implementation of OPS for the state government employees who are being covered under NPS. Jharkhand too has decided to revert to OPS.",Former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan has expressed his concern over the decision of some states to restart the old pension scheme.

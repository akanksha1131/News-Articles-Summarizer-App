"Catch, Australian online retailer owned by Wesfarmers, to shut down; 190 jobs to be axed",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/catch-australian-online-retailer-owned-by-wesfarmers-to-shut-down-190-jobs-to-be-axed/articleshow/117415907.cms,"Catch expects an operational deficit reaching $40million in the initial half of 2024-25.

Australian e-commerce platform Catch is looking to shut down, resulting in approximately 200 job losses due to heightened rivalry from Amazon and Temu.Wesfarmers , which acquired the online retailer for $230million in 2019, issued a closure announcement on Tuesday.According to a Daily Mail report, the company expects an operational deficit reaching $40million in the initial half of 2024-25.“While Catch's financial performance has been challenging, we have gained valuable insights and capabilities that have accelerated the group's digital transformation and supported the development of the OnePass membership program,” Daily Mail quoted Wesfarmers managing director Rob Scott as saying.The company cited intense rivalry from international online retailers such as Temu, Shein, and Amazon.“The recent increase in competitive intensity in the Australian e-commerce sector has affected Catch's financial performance and growth prospects,” according to the announcement.Whilst 100 positions will be preserved and transferred to other Wesfarmers subsidiaries like Kmart, 190 positions will be eliminated.The logistics centres will transition to Kmart's control during the final quarter of 2024-25.Kmart Group Managing Director Ian Bailey indicated the arrangement would enhance customer service through access to Catch's Moorebank warehouse in Sydney's south-west.“Kmart Group can better utilise Catch's fulfilment centres, which are currently less than 50 per cent utilised. The transition will result in faster deliveries to customers at a lower unit cost, while relieving pressure on our busy stores,” he explained.Established by Gabby and Hezi Leibovich as Catch of the Day in 2006, the business gained popularity amongst value-conscious Australian shoppers but ultimately struggled against competitors who faced fewer operational costs and taxes.","Australian e-commerce platform Catch is looking to shut down, resulting in approximately 200 job losses.

2) Significant Losses in Zomato and Other Major Stocks

3) Earnings

4) Realty, consumer stocks

5) Foreign Investment Outflow

Stock market crash today: BSE Sensex and Nifty50, the Indian equity benchmark indices, tanked in trade on Tuesday. While BSE Sensex crashed over 1,300 points, Nifty50 went below 23,000 briefly. BSE Sensex ended the day at 75,838.36, down 1,235 points or 1.60%. Nifty50 closed at 23,045.30, down 299 points or 1.28%.Major index constituents, including Reliance Industries, ICICI Bank and Zomato, registered substantial losses. The downturn intensified following U.S. President Donald Trump's announcement of trade tariffs on neighbouring countries after assuming office, which adversely affected investor confidence.The collective market value of BSE-listed firms decreased by Rs 7.48 lakh crore, reaching Rs 424.11 lakh crore.Investors remained cautious following U.S. President Donald Trump's inconsistent position on trade duties, with participants concerned about potential policy alterations. His latest statements about implementing tariffs on neighbouring nations have further disturbed global market sentiment.Trump's administration is evaluating a 25% tariff on Mexico and Canada beginning February 1, reducing expectations of postponement despite initial positive reactions to his inauguration address. This ambiguity has triggered worries about inflation, possible U.S. economic overheating, and dollar appreciation, potentially affecting bond markets.Zomato's shares fell by more than 11% after announcing a 57% year-on-year reduction in its December quarter net profit, contributing 150 points to the Sensex decline. Additional significant contributors to the Sensex's fall included Reliance, ICICI Bank, SBI, and M&M, collectively accounting for 490 points of the decrease.For the third quarter, Nifty50 companies are projected to show merely 3% year-over-year EPS growth, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. Sectors such as capital goods, healthcare and telecom are anticipated to deliver robust profit growth.

IT Fresher Hiring Targets

Looking ahead to FY26, industry leader Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) plans to exceed its typical recruitment numbers, targeting more than 40,000 campus freshers, according to an ET report.

Infosys, their primary competitor, remains committed to hiring over 15,000 freshers in FY25 and anticipates increasing this figure to exceed 20,000 in the following year.

Wipro, despite falling short of its FY25 commitment to hire 10,000 freshers, has announced plans to recruit between 10,000-12,000 new graduates in the upcoming fiscal year.

India’s top IT services firms like TCS and Infosys have set higher fresher recruitment goals for fiscal 2026, encouraged by indicators of renewed technology investment. The six largest IT organisations in the country collectively aim to recruit approximately 82,000 new graduates in the period beginning April 2025, despite reduced hiring in the current fiscal year.Whilst similar targets were set for FY25, actual recruitment numbers are expected to be lower, according to most companies. The third quarter ending December saw a collective workforce reduction of 225 employees, following positive recruitment figures in the second quarter after seven quarters of stagnation.The Indian IT sector, valued at $254 billion, experienced a significant reduction of over 70,000 employees in FY24, as clients reduced technology expenditure during a worldwide economic slowdown.Also Read | L&T Chairman, under fire for 90-hour work week comments, received Rs 51 crore pay in FY24 The banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI) sector and North American market have shown promising signs of increased discretionary technology spending during the traditionally slow third quarter (Q3), indicating positive growth prospects for IT companies in FY26.According to Infosys managing director and CEO Salil Parekh, recruitment expansion reflects the revival in discretionary spending, though subject to seasonal variations in revenue.The Bengaluru-based technology firm demonstrated robust Q3 performance with 7.6% year-on-year and 1.9% quarter-on-quarter revenue growth, leading to an upward revision of revenue guidance to 4.5-5% for the fiscal year.Also Read | No company for coders! Why Salesforce, among world's most-valued software companies, won’t hire more engineers The December quarter saw Infosys add approximately 5,600 personnel to its workforce.Recent financial earnings reports indicate that HCLTech and LTIMindtree each added more than 2,000 employees to their respective workforces during the December quarter.HCLTech, based in Noida, has reduced its FY25 fresher recruitment target from 10,000 to 7,000, citing enhanced productivity and reduced attrition. However, chief people officer Ramachandran Sundararajan confirmed higher hiring projections for FY26.The company anticipates recruiting more university graduates in FY26 compared to FY25.Sundararajan emphasised the company's commitment to specialisation-focused hiring, noting consistent success in meeting demand through recruitment efforts over the past four quarters.The December quarter saw significant workforce reductions, with TCS recording the largest decrease of 5,370 employees, whilst Tech Mahindra and Wipro reduced their staff by 3,785 and 1,157 respectively.During this traditionally quiet period, marked by furloughs and reduced working days, outsourcing companies implemented cost-cutting measures whilst leveraging productivity improvements through generative artificial intelligence (GenAI).Companies maintained that these reductions were seasonal and not indicative of overall demand conditions.Top IT firms have reported a sequential rise in their last twelve-month (LTM) attrition rates, indicating a gradual recovery in demand. However, LTIMindtree experienced a slight decrease of 20 basis points (0.20%) compared to the previous quarter.In the past decade, the outsourcing sector has experienced significant attrition rates, reaching up to 30% at its peak, primarily due to limited compensation and career advancement prospects at junior levels. Following the Covid-19 pandemic, these rates have decreased to 10-15%, influenced by the economic slowdown and reduced business demand over the last two financial years.""We see this (drop in headcount) getting ironed out in the coming quarter. That was more of a seasonal thing because we purposely onboarded fewer freshers in Q3 than what we will in Q4,"" stated Saurabh Govil, chief human resource officer at Wipro, explaining that recruitment strategies are influenced by demand and productivity factors.","India’s top IT services firms like TCS and Infosys have set higher fresher recruitment goals for fiscal 2026.

Sebi plans to allow trading in shares ahead of listing,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sebi-plans-to-allow-trading-in-shares-ahead-of-listing/articleshow/117437229.cms,"File photo

MUMBAI: Sebi is working on a ‘when listed’ concept for trading in shares of companies that are in the process of listing after the IPO bidding has closed and shares have been allotted.Currently, stocks of to-be listed companies are traded in the unofficial (grey) market. The Sebi move is aimed at neutralising the impact of this grey market where a popular concept, GMP ( grey market premium ), at times decides the listing price.On Tuesday, Sebi chairperson Madhabi Puri Buch said that the regulator is against ‘the black market’ for to-be listed stocks that exist and operates after shares in the IPO are allotted and the listing. An IPO investor who has got allotment in the offer, the investor’s “entitlement to those shares is crystalised” and “should have the right to sell those shares,” Buch told reporters.In the unofficial market, however, the duration of trading in yet-to-be-listed stocks happens for a much longer duration, usually for at least 15 days to the listing day. The Sebi chief was speaking at the annual conference of the Association of Investment Bankers of India (AIBI) in the city. “We feel that if investors want to do that, why not give them that opportunity in a proper, regulated way,” she said.A similar process is available in the govt bond market. Christened ‘when issued’ segment, here those govt bonds are traded for which the govt notification has already been issued but the bonds are yet to be sold in the market, usually 3-4 days after notification. Typically, yet-to-be-issued gilts are traded in this segment for that intervening period and once they are actually issued, trading in these bonds stops.In 2024, Dalal Street over 91 large companies getting listed through the IPO route, raising a record Rs 1.6 lakh crore, data from Prime Database showed.During Tuesday’s conference, Mahavir Lunawat, the president of AIBI, said that in the next two years, around 1,000 companies could go for listing through the IPO route. Sebi chief, who was addressing the gathering after Lunawat’s, said that the regulator, which is using various AI tools to process offer documents to speed up the system, was ready to handle such a large number of IPO applications.Buch said that the regulator was developing a standardized template for IPO submissions that will streamline the process for companies and merchant bankers. The template will utilize a simple fill-in-the-blanks approach, called the standard parameters. In addition, there will also be space for disclosing no-standard information that could be specific to companies or industries.","Currently, stocks of to-be listed companies are traded in the unofficial (grey) market.

MUMBAI: The sensex closed 1,235 points or 1.6% lower at 75,838 points — the lowest level since June — in a volatile session as investors on Dalal Street were left guessing about US President Donald Trump ’s moves that could hurt India’s economic interests. The not-so-encouraging results from most of the leading companies and fears of a rate hike by the Bank of Japan in its meeting on Friday also affected investor sentiment, market players said.Foreign funds were major sellers on Tuesday with a net outflow of Rs 5,920 crore, BSE data showed. So far in Jan, foreign portfolio investors have net sold stocks worth nearly Rs 57,000 crore, combined data from BSE and NSDL showed.The day’s session saw the sensex open about 200 points up at 77,262 but quickly lost over 700 points to a low of 76,261 points and then rallied over 950 points to a high of 77,337 points. Later, selling bouts pulled the index down to an intraday low of 75,642 points to finally settle near the day’s low level. Nifty too followed a similar path to close at 23,025 points, down 320 points or 1.4%. The day’s session left investors poorer by Rs 7.3 lakh crore with BSE’s market capitalisation now at 432.8 lakh crore.According to Vinod Nair of Geojit Financial Services, domestic markets experienced a significant decline on Tuesday, accompanied by high volatility on the back of Trump’s announcement of trade tariffs on neighbouring countries on his inauguration day. This added uncertainty to global markets. The weak recovery in the ongoing (third quarter) earnings announcements, coupled with a depreciating rupee are likely to prompt further outflows by foreign funds, Nair said.Investors globally are closely watching what the new US President does. “Trump’s remarks targeting BRICS nations, reiterating his intention to impose 100% tariffs on countries reducing their reliance on the US dollar for global trade, induced negative sentiments in the Indian market,” said Siddhartha Khemka of Motilal Oswal Financial Services. “Global markets are also intimidated by expectation of an interest rate hike by the Bank of Japan in its upcoming decision on Friday which could impact borrowing costs globally. We expect markets to remain under pressure in the near term amid mixed quarterly earnings and heavy FPI selling.”Meanwhile, Jio Financial said it has incorporated Jio Blackrock Broking to enter the stock broking space.","The sensex closed 1,235 points or 1.6% lower at 75,838 points.

Insurers want GST to continue on term plans,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/insurers-want-gst-to-continue-on-term-plans/articleshow/117436995.cms,"Representative photo

NEW DELHI: At a time when the ministerial panel on GST rationalisation is seeking to ensure that the benefits of lower tax are passed on to consumers, life insurance companies have petitioned against exempting term insurance policies from the levy.The life insurance industry has argued that the move will result in withdrawal of input tax credit (ITC) benefit for taxes paid on goods and services and services used by them and will increase costs for them. Estimating that ITC adds up to 11%, the companies have told the group of ministers, led by Bihar deputy chief minister Samrat Chaudhary, as well as officials at the Centre that at least 12% GST should be imposed. Besides, they want the full benefit of ITC to be available to offset any cost disadvantage.Life insurance companies have suggested that in the case of a reduction below 12%, there should be a reduction in the rate for insurance commission services too.One option will be to allow for zero rating, which means that while exempting GST on the output, there is no bar on availing of credit for taxes paid on inputs used for providing the service.“Due to this additional burden (ITC withdrawal), life insurance companies will be compelled to increase the premium which will not fully meet the objective of govt to provide life insurance product at affordable price. Additionally, GST exemption on renewal premiums (for policies sold in previous years) would make it onerous and unviable,” the companies have said in a representation.While exempting term insurance plans and health insurance up to a certain limit and for seniors was on the agenda of the last month’s GST Council’s meeting in Jaisalmer, the ministerial panel was asked to look at them once again.One of the reasons for the decision being postponed was that insurance regulator Irdai had not sent its comments on the issue, which is expected in the coming weeks. Given that the insurance industry has taken up the issue of ITC with the finance ministry and the regulator too, Irdai may flag it before the group of ministers.Besides, finance ministers are keen to ensure that the benefits of lower taxes are actually passed on to consumers since the anti-profiteering clause has now been done away with.","The life insurance industry has argued that the move will result in withdrawal of input tax credit (ITC) The companies have told the group of ministers, led by Bihar deputy chief minister Samrat Chaudhary, as well as officials at the Centre that at least 12% GST should be imposed.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117437118,imgsize-734348,width-400,resizemode-4/117437118.jpg"

BENGALURU: Worldwide IT spending is expected to touch $5.6 trillion this year, an increase of 9.8% from last year, a forecast by Gartner showed.“While budgets for CIOs are increasing, a significant portion will merely offset price increases within their recurrent spending,” said John-David Lovelock of Gartner.“This means that, in 2025, nominal spending versus real IT spending will be skewed, with price hikes absorbing some or all of budget growth. All major categories are reflecting higher-than-expected prices, prompting CIOs to defer and scale back their true budget expectations.”","Worldwide IT spending is expected to touch $5.6 trillion this year, an increase of 9.8% from last year.

Nazara Technologies announced on Monday its plans to secure Rs 495 crore through a 5.4% stake sale to Axana Estates , an entity established by the company's current investors. The entity was formed by Arpit Khandelwal, who founded Plutus Wealth Management , and Mithun Sacheti, the co-founder of CaratLane.The funding, aimed to support Nazara's strategic acquisitions and international growth plans, will likely grant promoter designation to Khandelwal and Sacheti, placing them alongside the company's founder Nitish Mittersain and his family members.""This consolidation of ownership will provide growth capital and bring strategic expertise to support Nazara, its promoters and team in the journey of becoming a world-leading gaming and entertainment brand,” Khandelwal said in a statement.The transaction, which is priced at Rs 990 per share, has triggered an open offer wherein Plutus Wealth Management and Axana Estates, along with persons acting in concert (PAC), will launch a public open offer to acquire an additional 26% stake in Nazara. The move is to comply with Sebi regulations that monitor 25% or above shareholding in a company. The exercise is expected to bring the total shareholding of the acquirers and PACs, along with the existing promoters – Vikash Mittersain, Nitish Mittersain, and the promoter group, to 61.5% of the company. This is contingent upon the open offer of 26% being fully subscribed.

MUMBAI: Macrotech Developers , a construction major promoted by Abhishek Lodha , has filed an intellectual property rights (IPR) suit before Bombay HC against his younger brother’s real estate company, the eponymous House of Abhinandan Lodha, seeking a stay on the use of ‘Lodha’ or a similar brand name to market properties.A single judge bench of Justice Manish Pitale on Tuesday said as the matter pertains to a commercial dispute whose value exceeds Rs 100 crore, it should be placed before the appropriate bench —Justice Arif Doctor, who is assigned to handle such high-value matters. Rahul Dwarkadas , co-founding partner of Veritas Legal, through whom the suit and application were filed, later had the matter mentioned and it has been posted for hearing on Jan 27.The application said the use of the ‘Lodha’ trademark by House of Abhinandan Lodha in real estate projects led to confusion among buyers and investors, resulting in an estimated loss of over Rs 5,000 crore, which is likely to rise if a stay is not granted.Lodha’s brand has been built over 40 years, making it crucial to protect its IPR and prevent confusion with similar developers, said a Macrotech spokesperson. The company was incorporated in 1995, and in May 2010, it applied for and obtained various trademarks and registered a domain name for its ‘Lodha’ brand. Nearly seven years later, following rising debts the company faced, Abhinandan separated to start a new business, the plea before HC said.The suit said from 2021-23, as the Lodha group grew, Abhinandan entered the real estate business dealing with “plots” and soon began calling his business ‘House of Abhinandan Lodha’ (HoABL).Asserting that Macrotech “is unable to digest” the success of his company, Abhinandan said, “‘House of Abhinandan Lodha’ is a registered trademark since 2021 and in just four years, we have projects at 16 locations with gross sales of over Rs 6,500 crore with over 7,000 customers across 25 countries, 23 states, 107 cities...” Its legal team will give “appropriate replies in court”, he said.Senior advocates Darius Khambata appeared for Macrotech, Janak Dwarkadas for Macrotech, and Aspi Chinoy for HoABL.",Macrotech Developers is a construction major promoted by Abhishek Lodha.

NEW DELHI: Gas consumption in India jumped 11% annually in 2024, leading to a spike in LNG ( liquefied natural gas ) imports for meeting rising demand across sectors — a development that is in line with govt’s low-carbon ambitions for the economy but also raises energy security vulnerability amid declining domestic production.While industries and oil refineries were the key drivers, the International Energy Agency ’s latest gas market report published on Tuesday said consumption in the residential, commercial as well as transport sectors also recorded double-digit growth, supported by lower relative prices of imported gas.Industry posted a gas consumption growth of 22%, refining 26%, residential and commercial sector 14% and transport sector 12%, the report said. Heatwaves in the May-July period also jacked up gas consumption for power generation by 32% as electricity demand rose to record levels due to increased usage of cooling appliances.“This demand growth led to a 21% year-on-year rise in LNG imports, supported by average spot LNG prices in India that were more than 12% lower than a year ago,” the IEA report said. “In 2024, the number of LNG cargoes tendered for delivery (both supplier offers and user invitations) in India increased by 70% year-on-year. The number of cargoes awarded increased by 85%, while the number of cargoes not awarded decreased by 20%,” the report said.Govt wants to raise the share of natural gas in India’s energy basket to 15% by 2030 from a little less than 7% at present. The report forecast India’s gas demand to increase by 8% this year, assuming average weather conditions, driven by the country’s growing energy needs and rapid economic expansion. But declining domestic production poses a challenge as demand rises.","Industry posted a gas consumption growth of 22%, refining 26%, residential and commercial sector 14% and transport sector 12%, the report said.

NEW DELHI: After being nearly absent from the global value chain and innovation discourse for several years, India has made significant headway in recent years with several top international brands now using the country as a manufacturing base, former minister Rajeev Chandrasekhar has said.“A decade ago, electronics manufacturing in India was dominated by domestic brands getting products designed outside and manufactured in China. In the last 3-4 years, we are seeing not just global and Indian brands being manufactured here, but also being designed to be manufactured here.

Expanding the Merit-Based Agenda



Defending Biological Definitions in Federal Policy



Requiring all federal agencies to revise documents, policies, and practices to reflect biological sex definitions.

Mandating that government-issued identification documents accurately reflect an individual’s biological sex.

Ending federal funding for programs that promote gender ideology or medical procedures related to gender transitions.

While proponents argue that this order restores clarity and scientific integrity, critics warn it could erode protections for transgender individuals and exacerbate social divisions.

A Look Back: The Rise of DEI



Key Provisions of the Executive Order



Terminate DEI Offices and Programs: Agencies must eliminate all DEI-related roles, committees, and initiatives, including Chief Diversity Officer positions.

and Programs: Agencies must eliminate all DEI-related roles, committees, and initiatives, including Chief Diversity Officer positions. Audit DEI Expenditures: Departments are required to report all DEI-related spending, grants, and contracts since January 2021.

Refocus Hiring Practices: Federal employment policies will now emphasize skills, performance, and merit, explicitly excluding race, gender, or other identity-based factors.

End DEI Training and Grants: Any training materials, grants, or contracts related to DEI or environmental justice are to be discontinued.

Backlash and Support



The Legal and Political Fallout



A Symbolic Shift



In a bold move that sent shockwaves across through liberal America, President Donald Trump launched his second term by signing an executive order that eradicates diversity, equity, and inclusion ( DEI ) programs from federal agencies. Titled, the order dismantles initiatives established during the Biden administration, which had prioritized DEI as a cornerstone of federal policy. For Trump, it’s a clean slate—one that prioritizes meritocracy, fiscal responsibility, and what his administration calls ""equal dignity and respect for all Americans.""Trump’s executive order doesn’t tiptoe around the issue; it delivers a decisive end to DEI’s federal footprint. Within 60 days, all DEI offices, such as Chief Diversity Officer roles, are to be shuttered. ""Equity Action Plans"" and DEI-related grants and contracts must be terminated. Federal hiring and performance evaluations will shift focus to individual merit and hard work, removing DEI considerations entirely. Even ""environmental justice"" programs—policies aimed at addressing environmental inequities in underserved communities—are not spared from the chopping block.Agencies are also tasked with reporting the costs and impacts of DEI initiatives implemented under the Biden administration. This move underscores the administration’s argument that such programs represent not only ideological overreach but also financial waste.The Trump administration’s rationale for dismantling DEI programs rests on the belief that they undermine fairness and equality by prioritizing group identity over individual merit. According to the executive order, Biden-era DEI policies were ""illegal and immoral,"" accusing them of fostering division and discrimination under the guise of inclusion.The administration insists that removing DEI initiatives will restore meritocracy and rebuild public trust. ""Federal resources should serve every citizen equally,"" the order declares, ""not divide Americans based on race, gender, or other identity factors.""Complementing the dismantling of DEI programs, Trump’s administration issued another sweeping directive: Reforming the Federal Hiring Process and Restoring Merit to Government Service. This executive order focuses on attracting top talent while eliminating perceived inefficiencies in the federal workforce. The order sets ambitious goals, including reducing the average hiring timeline to under 80 days, integrating modern technology in recruitment, and emphasizing individual merit over demographic considerations.The Federal Hiring Plan outlined in this order prioritizes candidates committed to constitutional principles and efficient governance. It also includes measures to ensure senior leadership positions across agencies reflect expertise and dedication to the country’s ideals. The administration argues that this approach will bolster public confidence in federal institutions while streamlining operations.In yet another headline-grabbing move, Trump signed the Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government executive order. This directive mandates the use of sex-based definitions in all federal policies, eliminating references to gender identity. The administration’s stated goal is to protect women’s rights and ensure fairness in single-sex spaces like prisons, shelters, and sports.Key provisions include:DEI policies gained significant traction during the Biden presidency, beginning with Executive Order 13985 on his first day in office. This directive required federal agencies to draft Equity Action Plans to address disparities in government services and outcomes. Over four years, DEI programs expanded across nearly all sectors of government, from education to environmental policy, often sparking heated debates about their effectiveness and intent.Critics of these policies argued that they prioritized optics over outcomes, creating bureaucratic bloat and fueling cultural division. Supporters, on the other hand, saw them as essential tools to address systemic inequities and promote fairness in public institutions. Trump’s executive order represents a sharp pivot from Biden’s approach, effectively dismantling these efforts in their entirety.Trump’s order is detailed and far-reaching, with provisions that:The response to the executive order has been predictably divided. Critics have called it a regressive measure that undermines progress toward inclusion and equity. Civil rights organizations argue that dismantling DEI programs will exacerbate systemic inequalities, particularly for marginalized groups.""This is a clear attack on efforts to level the playing field,"" said one advocate. ""It’s not about fairness—it’s about erasing the progress we’ve made.""On the other hand, supporters hail the move as a necessary correction. They argue that DEI programs often prioritize symbolic gestures over substantive change and that removing them will streamline government operations while reinforcing the principle of individual merit.Trump’s executive orders are almost certain to face legal challenges, with advocacy groups likely to argue that they violate civil rights protections. The broader cultural implications, however, may prove even more significant. By framing DEI programs and gender identity policies as divisive and wasteful, the administration has reignited a national debate over the role of identity and inclusion in public policy.More than just policy decisions, these executive orders signal a broader cultural and political shift. For Trump’s base, they represent a reaffirmation of his commitment to dismantle what they view as leftist overreach. For his opponents, they’re stark reminders of the deep ideological divides that define contemporary American politics.The dismantling of DEI programs and the emphasis on biological definitions represent pivotal moments in the culture wars, ones that will likely shape public discourse for years to come. Whether these moves mark the end of an era or the beginning of a new chapter remains to be seen. One thing is certain: in Trump’s America, DEI and gender ideology face another day of reckoning.","President Donald Trump signed an executive order that eradicates diversity, equity, and inclusion ( DEI ) programs from federal agencies.

Executive order amid LA wildfires

Withdrawal process requires one year

Half of Americans oppose withdrawing from accord

Trump's second term could severely impair future climate efforts

US President Donald Trump has announced the United States' second withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement , at the Capital One Arena in Washington during his inaugural parade event. This decision by one of the world's largest carbon polluters undermines international efforts to address global warming and sets the US apart from its allies. The announcement, made as Trump began his second term on Monday, mirrors his 2017 stance.The agreement aims to restrict long-term global warming to 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 degrees Celsius) above pre-industrial levels, or at minimum, maintain temperatures below 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit (2 degrees Celsius) above pre-industrial levels.The voluntary Paris agreement of 2015 enables nations to establish their own targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel consumption. These targets are intended to become progressively stricter, with countries required to submit new plans by February 2025. The departing Biden administration recently proposed reducing US greenhouse gas emissions by over 60 per cent by 2035.Laurence Tubiana, CEO of the European Climate Foundation and a principal architect of the Paris agreement, acknowledged the US withdrawal as unfortunate but emphasised that climate action transcends individual national policies.The current situation differs significantly from 2017, according to Tubiana, noting substantial economic momentum in the global transition, which the US has benefited from but might now lose.The International Energy Agency projects the global market for essential clean energy technologies will reach over $2 trillion by 2035, tripling its current size.Tubiana pointed to the severe wildfires in Los Angeles as evidence that Americans, like others worldwide, are experiencing the intensifying effects of climate change.Gina McCarthy, former White House climate adviser under President Biden, stated that achieving American leadership in the global economy, energy independence, and job creation requires continued focus on expanding the clean energy sector.Current global temperatures exceed mid-1800s levels by 2.3 degrees Fahrenheit (1.3 degrees Celsius). Most climate monitoring organisations reported that global temperatures surpassed the 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit warming threshold last year, unanimously declaring it the warmest on record.The Paris accord withdrawal process requires one year. Trump's previous withdrawal became effective the day after the 2020 presidential election, which he lost to Biden.Despite the initial shock of Trump's first withdrawal from the UN agreement - endorsed by 196 nations - no other country followed suit, according to Alden Meyer, a veteran climate negotiations analyst at E3G.Other nations, along with US investors, businesses, governors, and mayors, maintained their commitment to addressing climate change, experts noted.Nevertheless, they expressed concern about the loss of US leadership in global climate initiatives, particularly as the world faces increasingly severe weather events and record temperatures.""Clearly America is not going to play the commanding role in helping solve the climate crisis, the greatest dilemma humans have ever encountered,"" said climate activist and writer Bill McKibben. ""For the next few years the best we can hope is that Washington won't manage to wreck the efforts of others.""AP-NORC Centre polling indicates approximately half of Americans oppose withdrawing from the climate accord. Republican support for withdrawal is not overwhelming, with slightly less than half in favour and about one-fifth opposed.China surpassed the United States as the largest annual carbon dioxide emitter several years ago. The US, now second, emitted 4.9 billion metric tonnes of carbon dioxide in 2023, an 11% reduction from a decade earlier, according to Global Carbon Project scientists.However, due to carbon dioxide's atmospheric longevity, the US remains historically responsible for nearly 22 per cent of carbon dioxide emissions since 1950.Experts worry that a second Trump term could severely impair future climate efforts, potentially influencing other nations, particularly China, to reduce their environmental commitments.UN climate change executive secretary Simon Stiell remains hopeful about US participation in the global clean energy transition, warning that non-participation would benefit competitor economies while climate-related disasters intensify.",US President Donald Trump has announced the United States' second withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement.

The protest is small but loud. As limousines drive past, a few hundred young people have gathered on the Postplatz square in Davos, Switzerland.The high-altitude resort in the Alps that usually belongs to skiers looks different this week. Bakeries, cafes, and boutiques have been converted to host banks, companies, or whole countries for the next few days.A pub is now called ""Belgium House."" The old furniture has been cleared out and chic designer furniture and large advertising posters have been put in their place.The demonstrators outside shout ""Eat the rich"" and ""Tax the rich."" Some of them block the street. Their protest is directed at the participants of the World Economic Forum (WEF). They see the meeting, which runs from January 20-24, as a complete waste of money and time.""We are protesting against the lobby meeting of the rich and powerful in Davos. It is clear that they are the ones responsible for the current crises,"" says Mirjam Hostetmann from the youth organization Young Socialists Switzerland, which is connected to the Social Democratic Party of Switzerland. The group is helping organize the demonstration under the motto ""Strike WEF.""Ines Yabar has a slightly different view of the event.The young Peruvian was invited as a guest to the World Economic Forum this year. In Lima, she works with others to protect the environment, addresses social problems, and is active as a Global Shaper.

At the same time, she can understand why there are demonstrations outside.""I feel that this shows that young people care and wherever we can we will be protesting because it is important to raise our voice about issues we are passionate about,"" says Yabar. ""But we will also be in rooms where we can talk with people deliberately and intentionally that are making decisions that affect our future.""This year, 50 Global Shapers from around the world will take part in the discussions in Davos.They will discuss social justice , climate change, artificial intelligence (AI) and many other important topics.Being present in Davos is an opportunity for many, especially since many young people are dissatisfied.

They focus on children from poor families who have little access to the education system.""There are so many bright kids, exceptional people, their talent is often wasted,"" he muses. For his work, Saxena is being honored as the Social Entrepreneur of the Year at this year's WEF meeting.""If capitalism is going to work, it is critical that people who own a lot, share some of their wealth. That is their social responsibility,"" he says.Around 70,000 young Indians have taken part in Avanti Fellows' online courses on mathematics, technology, and various science subjects. Others receive targeted support in schools through the organization's programs.Saxena proudly reports on participants who graduated from the renowned Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the US after receiving funding. ""My approach is solution-based,"" he says, pulling a blanket closer to keep himself warm.His gaze wanders over the Swiss mountains. ""Problems should be solved by people who are most affected,"" says Saxena, reflecting on the issues at hand. ""There is certainly a truth in this.""","Young people are protesting outside the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. They see the meeting as a complete waste of money and time.

Relief that Donald Trump will hold off from imposing China-specific tariffs on his first day in office propelled US equity futures higher on Monday. The dollar slumped. The new administration has pivoted toward starting his second term with potential engagement with Beijing rather than another trade war. Trump plans to issue a broad memorandum that directs federal agencies to study existing trade policies and relationships with China, Canada and Mexico, the Wall Street Journal reported earlier Monday.","The dollar slumped.

Wealth extraction from India



Impact on India's economy and society



Multinational and colonial exploitation



Continuing Inequities



Colonialism's lasting impact



Global South struggles



A new report by Oxfam International , titled 'Takers, Not Makers,' reveals staggering figures on wealth extracted from India by Britain during the colonial era, claiming that $64.82 trillion was taken between 1765 and 1900. Of this, $33.8 trillion, which is more than half of the total wealth, adjusted for today’s value, is said to have enriched the UK’s richest 10%.Released at the World Economic Forum ’s annual meeting in Davos, the report pointed out colonialism’s lasting impact on inequality and economic systems. ""Legacies of inequality and pathologies of plunder, pioneered during the time of historical colonialism , continue to shape modern lives,"" Oxfam said.The report also specified that colonial practices perpetuated systemic wealth extraction from the Global South to the Global North, benefiting a select elite. “This has created a deeply unequal world, a world torn apart by division based on racism, a world that continues to systematically extract wealth from the Global South to primarily benefit the richest people in the Global North,” the report said.Oxfam calculated that the wealth extracted from India alone by Britain could carpet London’s surface area in £50 currency notes nearly four times. ""This would be enough to carpet the surface area of London in British pound 50 notes almost four times over,"" the report mentioned.The wealth extraction, Oxfam claimed, not only enriched the wealthiest 10% but also majorly benefited Britain’s emerging middle class, which received 32% of this income.The report details how India’s share of global industrial output dropped precipitously from 25% in 1750 to just 2% by 1900, primarily due to Britain’s protectionist policies targeting Asian textiles. ""This dramatic reduction can be attributed to Britain's implementation of stringent protectionist policies against Asian textiles, which systematically undermined India's industrial growth potential,"" the report added.During World War I , disruptions in colonial trade patterns inadvertently stimulated industrial growth in colonies, disclosing how external shocks temporarily alleviated colonial suppression.Oxfam also linked modern multinational corporations to colonial practices, tracing their origins to entities like the British East India Company . ""The concept of private multinational corporations, bankrolled by rich shareholders, was a product of the colonial era,” Oxfam stated, adding that these corporations employed private armies to suppress resistance.The East India Company alone had an army of 260,000 soldiers, double the size of Britain’s peacetime army, who engaged in land dispossession and violent repression.The report highlighted modern parallels, stating that wages in the Global South are 87–95% lower than for equivalent work in the Global North. It also mentioned the exploitation of natural resources and poor working conditions in supply chains dominated by multinational corporations.Oxfam also targeted global institutions like the WTO and World Bank for perpetuating inequities. “The inequality that these countries experience today is significantly of colonial making,” the report said.Oxfam also addressed the societal divisions entrenched during colonial rule, such as caste, religion, and language. For instance, it pointed out that only 0.14% of India’s mother tongues are used as mediums of instruction.The report further pointed out the devastating Bengal famine of 1943, which resulted in an estimated three million deaths. “Grain import restrictions during World War Two, underpinned by racist thinking, appear to have significantly contributed to or caused the Bengal famine,” Oxfam stated.Oxfam detailed how colonialism’s legacy continues to affect public services, education, and health in the Global South. It cited biopiracy, as seen in the case of neem, and the systemic exploitation of resources.Calling colonialism’s impact a “fruit from the poisoned tree,” Oxfam summed up its report stating that global inequality remains deeply rooted in the historical practices of extraction and exploitation.","Oxfam says $64.82 trillion was taken from India by Britain between 1765 and 1900.

Hindenburg's Nate Anderson could face securities fraud charges: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/hindenburgs-nate-anderson-could-face-securities-fraud-charges-report/articleshow/117376044.cms,"Nate Anderson , who recently announced the closure of his research firm Hindenburg, faces scrutiny over alleged connections with hedge funds in preparing reports to target companies, reports a Canadian portal citing documents submitted to an Ontario court.Court filings at the Ontario Superior Court of Justice reveal that Moez Kassam, who heads Canada's Anson hedge fund, accepted that his firm has shared research ""with a wide variety of sources"", including Hindenburg's Anderson.According to Market Frauds portal, court documents suggest collaboration between Hindenburg and Anson during report preparation. Such bearish report preparation without proper disclosure of participation could potentially lead to securities fraud charges from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).""We know for a fact, from the email conversations between Anderson and Anson Funds, that he was indeed working for Anson and published whatever they told him to, from the price target to what should and shouldn't be in the report. He asked them multiple times if they needed 'more'. From what we can see in the dozens of exchanges, at no time did he have editorial control. He was being told what to publish,"" the website claimed.Market Frauds also shared alleged email exchange screenshots between Hindenburg and Anson, which it claims to have obtained from Ontario court documents, to substantiate its allegations.""There are multiple counts of securities fraud for both Anson Funds and Nate Anderson, and we have only gone through 5 per cent of what's in there as of the time of writing. From what we have read so far, it is almost a certainty that when the whole exchange between Hindenburg and Anson reaches the SEC, Nate Anderson will be charged with securities fraud in 2025,"" it said.Short sellers typically borrow securities, sell them in the open market, and aim to repurchase at lower prices following their negative reports. The involvement of hedge funds raises concerns as they might place parallel bets, potentially increasing downward pressure on share prices. Hindenburg Research issued a report in 2020 about Facedrive, a Canadian enterprise that became public via reverse merger, marketing itself as an environmentally conscious ride-sharing service. The report criticised its excessive valuation and generous payments to promoters. Court records indicate Anson communicated with Anderson regarding the report and knew its publication timeline.These legal documents follow a distinct long-term investigation by the US Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission. In June, Anson Funds Management and Anson Advisors Inc settled SEC allegations by paying USD 2.25 million, without accepting or denying wrongdoing, for failing to disclose payments to external publishers of negative research.When established, Hindenburg announced receiving ""hundreds of leads each year from diverse sources,"" including sector specialists, informants and fellow investors. ""We rigorously vet each lead and have always maintained full editorial independence over our work.""Anderson announced the closure of Hindenburg Research last week. He gave no specific explanation for his decision but expressed wishes to dedicate more time to personal relationships.""Nearly 100 individuals have been charged civilly or criminally by regulators at least in part through our work, including billionaires and oligarchs. We shook some empires that we felt needed shaking,"" he said in his closure announcement.","Court documents suggest collaboration between Hindenburg and Anson during report preparation.

For next year, the World Bank has estimated growth to be at 6.7%. India will still retain the tag of fastest growing major economy in the world, against the backdrop of geopolitical tensions and global policy uncertainty .Several multilateral agencies have revised their growth estimates downwards for India after the National Statistics Office's (NSO) projection showed the economy is expected to expand by 6.4% - the lowest in four years in the current financial year, and sharply below the 8.2% recorded in 2023-24.The sharp slowdown in growth has triggered calls for measures to boost consumption, which some experts say have been hit by stubborn inflationary pressures. Pressures have mounted on the Reserve Bank of India to cut rates to boost growth. The budget is expected to unveil measures to step up growth, amid the backdrop of an uncertain global economy. With respect to the projection in Oct, growth in 2025 for China was marginally revised upward by 0.1 percentage point to 4.6%.Global growth has been projected at 3.3% both in 2025 and 2026, below the historical (2000-19) average of 3.7%. The forecast for 2025 is broadly unchanged from that in Oct 2024 WEO outlook, primarily on account of an upward revision in the US offsetting downward revisions in other major economies, according to IMF.","IMF retained India's growth forecast for 2024-25 at 6.5% but said that growth in the country has slowed more than predicted, led by a sharper-than-expected deceleration in industrial activity.

The aim is to shore up China's own production, reduce any potential job cuts, and prevent foreign investors from fleeing the country if the US imposes new trade barriers, the person said.Apple's main assembly partner Foxconn hasn't been able to dispatch its Chinese staff to India and its factory in the country hasn't been able to receive additional specialised machinery from China, some of the people said. There's been no immediate impact on production though, they said.China's ministry of foreign affairs said in a statement on Friday the nation ""treats all countries equally and is open to enterprises"" from everywhere. ""China has never done anything that harms interests of other nations to the detriment of itself,"" according to the statement. India's ministry of electronics and information technology and Foxconn didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.India has been crucial to Apple's strategy to lessen its reliance on China amid trade tensions between Washington and Beijing that could escalate further when Trump returns to the White House next week. Foxconn's assembly plant in Chennai accounts for about half of the country's iPhone exports, although the company still makes the bulk of Apple handsets in central China.Beijing doesn't want Foxconn to further diversify its production away to other regions, one of the people said. Foxconn employs hundreds of thousands of workers at its Chinese factories, and its large operations are key to local electronics supply chain as well as employment.Rest of World and Nikkei Asia had earlier reported on the Chinese curbs. While the trend of foreign companies shifting away from China started already several years ago, during Trump's first term, the exodus is set to intensify now and could include more technology companies, said Woods Chen, chief economist at Yuanta Securities in Taipei.The restrictions on tech equipment have also had an impact on manufacturing of electric vehicles and solar panels in India, the people said, with the Indian unit of Chinese EV maker BYD and Waaree Energies, India's largest solar-panel maker, affected.BYD's public relations staff and Waaree didn't immediately respond to messages seeking further information. Bloomberg had previously reported that Beijing wanted to limit the transfer of advanced technology for EV manufacturing, and officials had told carmakers at a meeting in July last year that they shouldn't make any auto-related investments in India. New Delhi was aware of the Chinese curbs on tech equipment but believed they weren't meant to single out India, govt officials said, asking not to be identified because the discussions are private.The two countries recently eased a four-year border stalemate and have taken gradual steps toward normalising relations. However, India still maintains strict curbs on Chinese investment into the country and limits visas for Chinese nationals, including engineers and technicians employed in high-tech manufacturing.Apple's China-based equipment partners, including Justec Shenzhen and Bozhon Precision, started receiving queries in 2024 from govt officials about why they were sending gear to India, according to one of the people. bloomberg","Officials in Beijing have verbally encouraged regulatory agencies and local govts to curb technology transfers and equipment exports to the regions.

On corporate jingoism and nationalism,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/on-corporate-jingoism-and-nationalism/articleshow/117334089.cms,"AI image (source: ChatGPT)

Jingoism vs nationalism: Understanding the distinction

Role of corporate jingoists and patriots

Value of jingoists and patriots in leadership

Empowering rank and file

Striking right balance

The debate over work-life balance scaled up after L&T chairman SN Subrahmanyan, who proposed a 90-hour work week, including working on Sundays. This suggestion, came after another such call of a 70-hour work week proposed by Infosys co-founder Narayan Murthy, drew sharp criticism from several quarters. Critics called these suggestions an outcome of an exploitative and outdated mindset.The backlash, however, highlights a broader tension in corporate environments between constructive corporate patriotism and blind corporate jingoism . While corporate patriots strive for organisational success by addressing flaws and fostering sustainable growth, corporate jingoists demand unwavering loyalty and relentless work, often disregarding employee well-being and work-life balance. Subrahmanyan’s remarks have ignited discussions about the fine line between dedication to professional excellence and the risk of promoting a culture of burnout and overwork.Jingoism and nationalism, though often conflated, reflect fundamentally different attitudes toward loyalty and identity. Nationalism is a sense of pride and devotion to one’s country, tempered by a broader understanding of its flaws and a desire to improve it. It is grounded in constructive commitment—a belief in the collective good and a willingness to contribute to its advancement. Jingoism, in contrast, is an extreme, often blind allegiance to one’s nation, marked by an unwavering belief in its superiority and infallibility. Jingoists view criticism as disloyalty and often adopt a combative stance toward dissent, fostering an environment of us-versus-them.In the corporate world, these paradigms manifest as corporate jingoists and corporate patriots. Corporate patriots (akin to nationalists) believe in their company’s mission and work to make it better, while acknowledging its flaws and striving for sustainable growth. They are loyal but critical thinkers, engaging with challenges to help the organization evolve. Corporate jingoists, however, see their company as a monolithic entity that can do no wrong. For them, the company is a near-sacred institution deserving of unquestioning allegiance, and their identity is inextricably tied to its success and dominance.While most employees in a company will view their job as a transactional engagement, a minority of corporate jingoists and patriots at senior levels can serve as anchors for the organization’s culture and vision. Corporate jingoists are particularly well-suited to the role of CEO or other cult-like leadership positions. Their unshakable belief in the company’s greatness inspires loyalty, drives bold decision-making, and creates a unifying narrative that galvanizes teams. These leaders embody the company, living and breathing its values with a fervor that transforms them into symbolic figures. Corporate patriots, on the other hand, often populate other senior roles, ensuring that the vision of the jingoistic CEO is tempered by pragmatism and a drive for sustainable progress.For the broader employee base, this leadership dynamic provides a choice. As they traverse their career paths—often moving between companies every few years—they can decide how deeply they want to engage. They may choose to adopt the passion of a corporate nationalist, commit fully as a jingoist, or treat their role as a stepping stone, viewing the company as just another employer. Each choice is valid, but it is the visibility of jingoistic leadership that serves as a litmus test for potential allegiance. By showcasing such passionate devotion at the top, companies provide employees the opportunity to reflect on their own alignment with the organization’s culture and values.This balance between jingoists and patriots at senior levels, coupled with the freedom of the rank and file to decide their own level of engagement, creates a healthy organizational ecosystem. The jingoist CEO ensures the company’s identity remains strong and uncompromising, while corporate patriots and rank-and-file pragmatists provide the critical thinking and operational flexibility necessary for sustained success. Together, they form a dynamic system that allows companies to cultivate loyalty where it matters most, while leaving room for individual autonomy and career mobility.","The debate over work-life balance scaled up after L&T chairman SN Subrahmanyan proposed a 90-hour work week, including working on Sundays.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume.While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021.

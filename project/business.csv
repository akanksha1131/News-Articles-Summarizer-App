Stock market recommendations: According to Bajaj Broking Research, UPL, and Chennai Petroleum Corporation are the top stock picks for today. Here’s its view on Nifty, Bank Nifty and the top stock picks for July 4, 2025:In recent weeks, the Nifty index has showcased remarkable resilience, maintaining its upward trajectory and investor confidence despite a challenging macroeconomic and geopolitical environment. The index formed a nine month high of 25,669 on Monday’s trade. Index thereafter consolidated in a 300 points range with corrective bias signaling profit booking at higher levels after recent strong up move.The index during the current week rebounded from the immediate support area of 25,400-25,350. Going ahead, the index holding above 25,400-35,350 on a closing basis will lead to a pullback towards 25,900-26,000 levels in the coming sessions. However, failure to do so may lead to a healthy retracement or consolidation, with the index likely moving within the broader 25,200–25,700 range.The percentage of Nifty 500 constituents trading above their 200-day exponential moving average (EMA) — a widely tracked measure of market breadth — has shown a notable and broad-based recovery in recent months. After bottoming out below the 10% mark in March 2025, a level historically associated with extreme bearish sentiment and oversold market conditions, the indicator has since rebounded sharply and currently stands at approximately 59%.This resurgence reflects a meaningful shift in market dynamics, transitioning from narrow leadership to a more inclusive rally. Importantly, breadth thrusts of this nature have historically preceded or accompanied sustained bull market phases. In prior cycles, similar recoveries have seen the indicator rise to above 90%, suggesting there may be further upside potential in the current move.The improvement in this breadth metric indicates that the ongoing rally is gaining internal strength, with a growing number of stocks participating in the upside. This is a constructive signal for medium- to long-term investors, as healthy breadth tends to support the durability of upward market trends.Key positional support lies at 25,200–25,000 levels being the confluence of the 20 days EMA and the upper boundary of the recent consolidation breakout area (25,200-24,500), which is expected to act as a support level, showcasing change of polarity, where previous resistance turns into support.Bank Nifty consolidated with positive bias at the all-time high during last month. Escalating tensions in key global regions, which typically heighten market volatility, have not deterred the index's momentum.We expect the index to extend the current up move and head towards 58,500- 59,000 levels in the coming month, the measuring implication of the last 15 sessions consolidation breakout (57050-55150).The Index has rallied 18% in the last four months, hence some consolidation cannot be ruled out at higher levels. We believe dips in the coming month should be used as a buying opportunity. Key support is placed around 56,000-55,500.The stock has witnessed a strong rebound after a base at the 100 days EMA signaling strength. It is at the cusp of breaking above the high of May 2025 (699) thus offers fresh entry opportunity.The weekly 14 periods RSI has recently generated a buy signal moving above its nine periods average thus validating positive bias.We expect the stock to head higher towards 747 levels in the coming months being the 161.8% external retracement of the previous decline (699-618).The stock has recently generated a breakout above a falling channel in the weekly chart signaling strength and offers fresh entry opportunity.The breakout is supported by strong volume and the base of recent consolidation is placed at the 500 days EMA which supports the positive bias.The weekly stochastic has generated a buy signal moving above its nine periods average signaling positive bias. We expect the stock to head towards 787 levels in the coming months being the 61.8% retracement of the previous decline of October 2024 to March 2025 (999-433).","According to Bajaj Broking Research, UPL, and Chennai Petroleum Corporation are the top stock picks for today.

SEBI's Bank On Jane Street

US trading firm Jane Street has been barred by Indian market regulator, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), from domestic markets. SEBI has imposed restrictions on Jane Street trading firm, ordering them to surrender unlawful profits of Rs 4,843.57 crore for alleged index manipulation during expiry days to secure substantial gains in index options.The restrictions apply to JSI Investments, JSI2 Investments Pvt Ltd, Jane Street Singapore Pte Ltd, and Jane Street Asia Trading of Jane Street Group (JS Group).A Sebi interim order issued on Thursday revealed that JS Group entities accumulated profits exceeding Rs 43,289 crore from NSE index options between January 1, 2023 and March 31, 2025, spanning all product categories and NSE segments.The entities received instructions to stop participating in any fraudulent, manipulative or unfair trading practices, or engaging in activities that could violate regulations, whether directly or indirectly.Sebi identified JS Group's questionable trading patterns earlier this year. NSE, acting as the primary regulator, explicitly warned JS Group to avoid excessive risks in index options markets and cease trading patterns suggesting manipulation, according to a PTI report.Subsequently, JS Group assured NSE in February 2025 of their commitment to regulatory compliance.Despite receiving a cautionary notice in February and making declarations to NSE, Sebi observed that JS Group resumed apparent manipulative 'extended marking the close' trading patterns in May 2025, involving substantial and aggressive intervention in index and constituent markets near expiry day closing to influence index movements for illegal advantage.""Such egregious behaviour, in clear disregard/ defiance of the explicit advisory issued to them by NSE in February 2025, amply demonstrates that unlike the vast majority of Foreign Portfolio Investors and other market participants, JS Group is not a good faith actor that can be, or deserves to be, trusted.""In the face of such a strong prima facie case that allowing the JS Group to continue as before may severely compromise investor protection on an extraordinary scale, Sebi has a duty to directly intervene,"" Sebi's whole time member Ananth Narayan G said in the order.Consequently, Sebi mandated JS Group to surrender unlawful gains amounting to Rs 4,843.57 crore.","US trading firm Jane Street has been barred by Indian market regulator, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), from domestic markets.

Trent share price today: Stock drops around 9% after slower growth outlined at AGM; Nuvama downgrades,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/trent-share-price-today-stock-drops-around-9-after-slower-growth-outlined-at-agm-nuvama-downgrades/articleshow/122245807.cms,"Nuvama expressed its concerns about the potential slowdown in Trent's growth. (AI image)

Trent: Key AGM Updates

Trent Ltd, a Tata Group company, saw a significant share price decline of 8.7% to Rs 5,652 on the National Stock Exchange on Friday. This drop followed the company's AGM announcement regarding slower revenue growth, leading Nuvama brokerage to revise its rating to 'hold' and reduce the target price from Rs 6,627 to Rs 5,884.During its AGM, Trent revealed anticipated revenue growth of approximately 20% for Q1FY26, indicating a substantial reduction from its previous performance, according to an ET report. This forecast represents a considerable decrease from the 35% CAGR achieved during FY20-FY25, falling below the company's targeted 25% CAGR for future periods.Nuvama expressed its concerns about the potential slowdown, stating: ""At its AGM, Trent disappointed on near-term growth expectations in its core fashion business, which is expected to deliver ~20% growth in Q1FY26E, sharply down from its five-year CAGR of 35% (FY20–25). Management reaffirmed their aspiration of 25%-plus growth for the coming few years, but the current run rate falls short of it.""Following this development, Nuvama adjusted its projections downward, reducing FY26 and FY27 revenue forecasts by 5% and 6% respectively. Additionally, EBITDA estimates saw reductions of 9% and 12%.The brokerage's decision to adopt a more conservative investment position stemmed from the observed growth moderation, necessitating a reassessment of both Trent's earnings outlook and valuation.While downgrading its rating, Nuvama recognised Trent's enduring aspirations and implementation success, specifically highlighting its reaffirmed goal of achieving a tenfold revenue increase in the upcoming years—a strategic objective initially presented in FY23. During the AGM, the leadership team reported that revenue had already doubled since announcing this target.""This growth will be backed by robust additions of ~250 stores across formats as per management guidance, whose tone has historically been conservative. Accordingly, we remain confident of management beating this given the execution track record,"" Nuvama said.The financial services firm identified Zudio Beauty and Star Bazaar as key revenue generators for future expansion, whilst noting that both ventures require operational stability before undertaking significant growth initiatives.Star Bazaar outlook: Trent Hypermarket (Star Bazaar) has the potential to grow larger than Westside and Zudio, primarily due to the substantial size of India's food retail sector.Independent operations: Star Bazaar will maintain its focus on Trent's branded products, without plans to integrate with Big Basket, which is viewed as a higher-priced alternative.Growth targets: Management confirmed their FY23 target of achieving 10x revenue growth, highlighting that revenue has already increased twofold since the announcement.Retail expansion plans: The organisation plans to establish over 250 new stores across various formats in FY26, with flexibility to increase this number based on market dynamics and real estate availability.Trent's share price has increased by approximately 70% in 2025, reflecting positive investor sentiment towards its growth strategy. However, Nuvama has expressed concerns about the sustainability of these high valuations, noting indications of declining momentum, according to the ET report.""Underwhelming near-term growth prompts the downgrade to 'HOLD' as the current valuation is too demanding. A significant jump in growth profile, or pickup in other levers i.e. Star Bazaar, Zudio Beauty remain the key risks to our view,"" the brokerage concluded.The company disclosed its Q1 business performance update on Friday morning, post market opening.For the April–June quarter of FY26, Trent's standalone revenue from product sales (including GST) reached Rs 5,061 crore, showing a 20% increase from Rs 4,228 crore in the corresponding period of the previous year, aligning with their projected guidance.As at June 30, 2025, Trent's retail presence comprised 248 Westside stores, 766 Zudio stores (with two locations in the UAE), and 29 stores representing various other lifestyle concepts.(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market and other asset classes given by experts are their own.

India-US trade: New Vietnam deal raises red flags; GTRI urges New Delhi to tread carefully,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/india-us-trade-new-vietnam-deal-raises-red-flags-gtri-urges-new-delhi-to-tread-carefully/articleshow/122217750.cms,"Representative image

A new trade agreement between the United States and Vietnam is sending ripples through Asian export markets, with Indian exporters being advised to take caution, according to a report by the Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI).The deal, announced by US President Donald Trump, imposes a flat 20 per cent tariff on all Vietnamese exports to the US, a move that could disrupt Vietnam’s $135 billion export flow and reverse two decades of trade liberalisation.“For Indian exporters eyeing Vietnam as a competitor and partner in regional value chains, the deal presents both cautionary lessons and strategic implications,” the GTRI report stated, according to news agency ANI.The trade pact replaces Vietnam’s 2000 Bilateral Trade Agreement (BTA), which allowed Vietnamese goods preferential access to the US at tariff rates between 2 per cent and 10 per cent. Key sectors like textiles, footwear, seafood, and furniture, which had driven Vietnam’s export growth from $800 million in 2001 to over $135 billion, will now lose that cost advantage.The new deal, as per AFP, also includes a punitive 40 per cent tariff on goods routed through Vietnam but originally manufactured in countries like China, a measure seen as targeting “transshipment” to evade stricter US tariffs.However, trade experts have raised legal concerns about this provision, warning that it may breach World Trade Organisation (WTO) norms since routing does not change the origin of goods.Trump announced the deal on his Truth Social platform, stating that “Vietnam will do something that they have never done before — give the United States of America total access to their Markets for Trade.” In return, Vietnamese exports face a 20 per cent US tariff, down from a previously proposed 46 per cent but still more than double the original BTA terms.Peter Navarro, Trump’s trade advisor, previously accused Vietnam of being a “colony of China,” alleging that a third of its exports were in fact Chinese goods relabelled to bypass tariffs. While Hanoi confirmed a resolution on reciprocal tariffs, it did not detail the final terms.For India, the timing of this deal is critical. The GTRI report cautions Indian negotiators, who are in the final stages of their own trade talks with the US, to learn from Vietnam’s experience, especially the risks of sudden reversals in tariff concessions, unclear rules on product origin, and flat duty structures that can undercut long-term trade stability.With Washington reshaping its Asia trade strategy, Indian policymakers and exporters are being urged to closely track developments and adapt proactively.The GTRI concluded that understanding the vulnerabilities exposed by the Vietnam deal could help India avoid similar pitfalls in its own trade trajectory.","New trade agreement between the United States and Vietnam is sending ripples through Asian export markets.

EU Nations Buying Russia Oil ‘FRUSTRATE’ Zelensky; Ukraine President Goes On Ugly Rant | Watch





What’s the 500% tariff threat about?

The proposed sanctions legislation, which has garnered support from 84 co-sponsors as noted by Graham, seeks to exert pressure on nations such as India and China to cease purchasing Russian oil and commodities. The objective is to diminish Moscow's wartime economy and compel Russian President Vladimir Putin to engage in negotiations regarding Ukraine, whilst providing Trump with necessary authority.

The bill, first introduced in March, is anticipated to advance in August. This initiative aligns with the United States' intensified measures to impose stricter economic restrictions on Russia, as Trump attempts to persuade Putin towards diplomatic discussions amidst the ongoing Ukraine conflict.

The Senate postponed introducing the legislation following the White House's resistance to broadening sanctions during Trump's endeavours to improve relations with the Russian leader. Nevertheless, the administration now appears prepared to endorse these restrictive measures.

How will it impact India?

Hence, a 500% tariff on countries importing oil from Russia may impact India very badly. Incidentally, India has also stepped up oil imports from America. United States crude oil exports to India saw a substantial rise, reaching 439,000 barrels per day in June, marking a notable increase from the 280,000 barrels per day recorded in May.

Will Trump really sign the 500% tariff order?

Russia's Response to The Bill

India, a large importer of crude oil from Russia, may have to watch out for a new US bill which proposes imposing a 500% tariff on countries that import from Russia. In an interview with ABC News, Senator Lindsey Graham said that he wanted the US to impose tariffs to stop them from supporting Vladimir Putin's war machine. Moscow launched full-scale invasion of Ukraine three years ago on February 24, 2022.""Big breakthrough here. So what does this bill do? If you're buying products from Russia and you're not helping Ukraine, then there's a 500 percent tariff on your products coming into the United States. India and China buy 70 percent of Putin's oil. They keep his war machine going. My bill has 84 co-sponsors. It would allow the president to put tariffs on China and India and other countries to get them -- stop them from supporting Putin's war machine, to get him to the table. For the first time yesterday, the president told me,"" Graham said.Also read: 'Economic bunker buster for India, China': How this US senator's Russia sanctions bill would prove 'bone crushing' for trade- if passed Graham has actively been advocating for the legislation, cautioning that it would serve as an ""economic bunker buster"" for nations such as India and China, which have substantially enhanced their imports of Russian petroleum products.India significantly altered its oil procurement patterns after Russia's Ukraine invasion in February 2022.The country transitioned from its traditional Middle Eastern suppliers to Russian oil sources, capitalising on favourable prices resulting from Western sanctions and European embargoes. Russian oil deliveries to India stood at 1.96 million barrels per day (bpd) in May.The transformation in India's oil import strategy has been remarkable, with Russian oil's share increasing from less than 1 per cent to roughly 40-44 per cent of total crude purchases in a short period.Also Read | India laps up discounted crude: RIL, Nayara Energy get big chunk of Russia’s flagship oil exports; Reliance world’s single biggest buyer of Urals India's Russian oil imports reached new heights in June, surpassing combined imports from Saudi Arabia and Iraq, during a period of market uncertainty following Israel's major offensive against Iran.As the world's third-largest oil importer and consumer, India has secured roughly 5.1 million barrels of international crude oil, which its refineries convert into various fuel products including petrol and diesel.""According to preliminary analysis by global trade analytics firm Kpler quoted in a PTI report, Indian refiners are expected to purchase 2-2.2 million barrels per day of Russian crude oil in June, reaching a two-year peak and exceeding the total quantities acquired from Iraq, Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Kuwait.""India has also become the primary recipient of Russian Urals oil grade transported by sea in 2025, receiving 80% of the total exports. The country's two private refineries have substantially boosted their imports of this lower-priced crude.According to Kpler statistics referenced in a Bloomberg report, India acquired 231 million barrels of Urals through June 24, with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Nayara Energy Ltd. jointly obtaining 45% of Russia's exports of this medium-sour grade.The proportion of Urals purchases by these two private Indian refiners has steadily increased in recent years, particularly in 2025. Reliance has positioned itself as the world's largest buyer of Urals, having purchased 77 million barrels in the current year.Graham has clarified that Trump would retain discretionary power through a waiver provision, enabling him to decide on the bill's implementation should it successfully pass through Congress.""I was playing with him (Trump). He says, ""It's time to move -- move your bill. There's a waiver in the bill, Mr. President. You're in charge whether or not it's to be implemented.""

He belongs to a group of inveterate Russophobes. If it were up to him, these sanctions would have been imposed long ago,"" said Peskov.Peskov further questioned the effectiveness of such measures by stating, ""Would that have helped the (Ukraine) settlement (process)?

Saudi Arabia, Russia, and six other key members of the OPEC+ group have announced rising oil production by 548,000 barrels per day (bpd) in August, more than what analysts had predicted.Experts were expecting the group to stick to an increase of 411,000 bpd, which had been the monthly target for May, June and July. But the alliance said in a statement that the decision for a bigger hike was due to “a steady global economic outlook and current healthy market fundamentals, as reflected in the low oil inventories.”Jorge Leon from Rystad Energy told AFP, ""OPEC+ keeps surprising the market — this latest hike was even larger than expected and sends a clear message, for anyone still in doubt: the group is firmly shifting toward a market share strategy.""Leon further said that two big questions remain: first, after the full 2.2 million barrels per day of voluntary cuts are rolled back, will OPEC+ move to unwind the next tier of 1.66 million barrels. Aditionally, will there be enough demand in the market to absorb that additional supply?""With prices holding comfortably above $60 and a turbulent geopolitical backdrop — especially given the fragile ceasefire in the Middle East, and broader risks in Ukraine and Libya — the answer to both questions might well be 'yes'.""Another analyst, Giovanni Staunovo, from UBS added, ""Effectively Kazakhstan and Iraq still overproducing their higher quotas is a factor supporting the cut unwind decision.""The decision follows a tense 12-day conflict between Iran and Israel, which briefly pushed oil prices above $80 per barrel due to fears over a possible closure of the Strait of Hormuz, a crucial route for about 20% of global oil.OPEC+, made up of the 12 members of OPEC and its allies, had been cutting production since 2022 to support prices. But in a surprising shift, eight countries led by Saudi Arabia began raising output in May, causing oil prices to fall. Prices have since hovered between $65 and $70 per barrel.An estimate by Bloomberg suggested that despite doubling production targets, the group only increased output by 200,000 bpd in May. This fresh hike could be Saudi Arabia’s way of putting pressure on members who have not stuck to their agreed quotas, by reducing the profits they can make from oil.","Saudi Arabia, Russia, and six other key members of the OPEC+ group have announced rising oil production by 548,000 barrels per day (bpd) in August.

However, an official has clarified that this step will not impact ongoing talks for a trade deal between the two countries, and is a procedural move under the WTO agreement on safeguards.On Friday, India proposed the move under World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules, treating the US tariff action as a “safeguard measure.” A notification circulated at the WTO stated that India could raise tariffs on selected American goods in response.An official was quoted as saying in a PTI report, ""The notification in WTO is an essential step to reserve India's right, in accordance with the provisions of the agreement on safeguard and does not prejudice ongoing discussions, deliberations, negotiations for finalizing tranche one or subsequent tranches of India-US bilateral trade agreement (BTA) in any way.""The US had imposed the tariff on 26 March 2025 under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act, 1974. In response, India had earlier requested consultations under the WTO’s Agreement on Safeguards. With the 30-day consultation period now over, India has taken the next procedural step.""India treated it as a safeguard measure and gave a notice for consultation under the WTO agreement earlier. Now, as per the provisions of that agreement, after completion of 30 days period for consultation, as a next step, India has notified that it is reserving its right to suspend concession on equivalent US exports to India as a response to enhanced tariff of 25 per cent imposed by the US on Indian exports of auto components,"" the official said.Talks between India and the US aim to conclude the first phase of the BTA by September or October, with the goal of increasing bilateral trade to $500 billion by 2030 from the current $191 billion.Before that, both sides are also discussing an interim trade agreement, expected before 9 July, the deadline marking the end of the 90-day suspension period of the so-called Trump tariffs.US President Donald Trump has said he has signed letters informing 10–12 countries about new import duties, and these letters will be sent on Monday.However, sources indicate that there is uncertainty around whether the interim deal will be announced between the two nations before the July 9 deadline.Earlier on Friday, commerce minister Piyush Goyal said that India will not rush into any deal just to meet a deadline. He said that any deal will be accepted with the US only when it is completely finalized, properly concluded and is in the national interest.He further added that FTAs or free trade agreements are possible only when both the nations are benefitted and are in a win-win agreement.India and the US are both signatories to the WTO’s Agreement on Safeguards, which allows any member country to withdraw or suspend tariff concessions if another member imposes safeguard measures on its imports.",India has officially reserved its right to impose retaliatory duties on the United States for placing a 25 per cent tariff on imports of Indian auto parts. An official has clarified that this step will not impact ongoing talks for a trade deal between the two countries.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122270362,imgsize-60542,width-400,resizemode-4/122270362.jpg"
"'Need for decentralisation': Number of poor rising as wealth concentrates within some hands; 'should not happen,' says Gadkari",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/need-for-decentralisation-number-of-poor-rising-as-wealth-concentrates-within-some-hands-should-not-happen-says-gadkari/articleshow/122270710.cms,"Nitin Gadkari

Union minister Nitin Gadkari on Saturday raised concern over the growing number of poor people in the country, saying that wealth was increasingly being concentrated in the hands of a few.Speaking at an event in Nagpur, the road transport and highways minister stressed the need for decentralisation of wealth and inclusive economic growth. “Slowly the number of poor people is increasing and wealth is getting centralised in the hands of some wealthy people. It should not happen,” he said.Gadkari said the economy must grow in a way that creates employment and uplifts rural areas. “We are looking at an economic option that will create jobs and (give a boost to the) growth of the economy. There is a need for decentralisation of wealth, and many changes have happened in that direction,” he added.He credited former prime ministers P V Narasimha Rao and Manmohan Singh for introducing liberal economic policies, but warned against letting centralisation go unchecked. “We have to be worried about it,” he said.Highlighting sectoral imbalance in the economy, Gadkari pointed out that while manufacturing contributes 22–24% and services 52–54% to GDP, agriculture, which employs 65–70% of the rural population, contributes only about 12%.Invoking Swami Vivekananda, Gadkari said, “Philosophy cannot be taught to someone whose stomach is empty.” He also underlined the changing role of chartered accountants. “CAs can be the growth engines of the economy. Our economy is changing rapidly. It is not only about filing income tax returns and GST submissions,” he said.Gadkari spoke about his contributions to the transport sector, including the Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) model. “I was the one who started the Build-Operate-Transfer system for road construction,” he said.He claimed there was no shortage of money for road projects. “Sometimes I say I do not have a fund crunch but I have a shortage of work,” Gadkari remarked.“Now, we earn nearly Rs 55,000 crore through toll booths and in the next two years, our income will go up to Rs 1.40 lakh crore. If we monetise it for the next 15 years, we will have Rs 12 lakh crore. New toll will add more money to our coffers,” he said.The minister also discussed projects aimed at improving connectivity and encouraging investment.He further added that at present, toll booths earn almost Rs 55,000 crore and the number will go up to Rs 1.40 lakh crore over the next two years.""If we monetise it for the next 15 years, we will have Rs 12 lakh crore. New toll will add more money to our coffers,” the minister said, quoted by PTI.On raising domestic funds, Gadkari said he had done it without relying on foreign countries. “I am not accepting money from foreign countries like Canada or the US. I will build roads from the money raised from the poor people of the country,” he said, noting that the bond share price had risen from Rs 100 to Rs 160, with investors getting returns of nearly 18–20%.","Road transport and highways minister Nitin Gadkari said the economy must grow in a way that creates employment and uplifts rural areas.

Capital markets regulator Sebi stepped up surveillance for the stock market and warned that any kind of manipulation will not be tolerated.Sebi Chairman Tuhin Kanta Pandey made this clear on Saturday, a day after the regulator passed an interim order against US-based hedge fund Jane Street Group.Pandey said monitoring has been tightened both by Sebi and at the stock exchange level. When asked if similar behaviour had been seen with other foreign investors, he responded, ""All what I can say that market manipulation is not going to be tolerated"".Earlier, on Friday, the regulator barred Jane Street Group from participating in the Indian securities market and ordered it to return illegal gains worth Rs 4,843 crore. The group has been accused of manipulating stock indices through positions in the derivatives market. This may be the highest ever disgorgement ordered by Sebi.In its interim order, Sebi prohibited four entities: JSI Investments, JSI2 Investments Pvt Ltd, Jane Street Singapore Pte Ltd, and Jane Street Asia Trading, from trading until further notice, while investigations continue.Later in the day, at an event hosted by the Bombay Chartered Accountants Society, Pandey also stressed the importance of transparency and ethics in corporate governance.He told chartered accountants that disclosing related party transactions, managing conflicts of interest, and reporting key developments on time were ""non-negotiable responsibilities"".""You have a critical responsibility to ensure that corporate governance is not reduced to a checklist,"" he said, addressing the CAs.Pandey also said that excessive compliance requirements can become burdensome and may not always serve their intended purpose.""We are also mindful that too much of information, too much of compliance adds to a big compliance burden which may not actually serve the interest that we really intend to serve,"" he said.“We would also like to see wherever we have the possibility of doing better results with less compliance, less information, less onerous responsibility and less micromanagement on the part of regulator,” he added, inviting suggestions for improvement.","Sebi Chairman Tuhin Kanta Pandey said monitoring has been tightened both by Sebi and at the stock exchange level.

BENGALURU: In the age of artificial intelligence, software engineers must evolve into decision-makers with CEO-like vision, said OpenAI’s VP of Engineering Srinivas Narayanan, speaking at the IIT Madras Alumni Association’s Sangam 2025 conference on Saturday.“The job is shifting from just writing code to asking the right questions and defining the ‘what’ and ‘why’ of a problem. AI can already handle much of the ‘how,’” Narayanan said, urging developers to focus on purpose and ambition over executional detail.Joining him on stage, Microsoft’s Chief Product Officer Aparna Chennapragada warned that simply retrofitting AI onto legacy tools won’t be enough. “AI isn’t a feature you can just add on. We need to start building with an AI-first mindset,” she said, pointing to how natural language interfaces are replacing traditional UX layers.The panel, moderated by IITMAA President and Unimity CEO Shyamala Rajaram, explored AI’s impact on jobs, product design, safety, and education. Chennapragada said the future belongs to those who combine deep expertise with generalist flexibility. “Prompt sets are the new PRDs,” she quipped, referring to how product teams now work closely with models to prototype faster and smarter.Narayanan shared that OpenAI’s models are already being used in medical diagnostics, citing a case where a reasoning model identified rare genetic disorders at a Berkeley-linked research lab. “The potential of AI as a collaborator, even in research, is enormous,” he said.On risks, Narayanan acknowledged challenges such as misinformation, unsafe outputs, and misuse. He noted that OpenAI recently rolled back a model for exhibiting ""sycophancy"" traits during testing, highlighting the company’s iterative deployment philosophy.Both speakers stressed accessibility and scale. While Chennapragada called for broader “CS + AI” fluency, Narayanan said model costs have dropped 100-fold over two years. “We want to democratise intelligence,” he said.Chennapragada closed with a thought: “In a world where intelligence is no longer the gatekeeper, the real differentiators will be ambition and agency.”","Software engineers must evolve into decision-makers with CEO-like vision.

Kamakoti announced at the annual alumni gathering Sangam 2025 on Saturday. The fund, titled the IITM Alumni Fund, will mark a first-of-its-kind initiative in India’s academic landscape, directly linking alumni capital with institute-affiliated entrepreneurship.“All of you can invest,” Prof. Kamakoti told the alumni audience. “This is your opportunity to work with great startups and technologies, and to grow along with your alma mater.”The fund aims to support early-stage companies founded by IIT Madras students, faculty, and alumni, and will invite contributions from the global IITM alumni network. Kamakoti cited the Tamil phrase, loosely translated as “giving returns to the giver,” to underline the dual value proposition of impact and returns.While operational details are yet to be formally released, the fund’s vision is bold: By 2032, Kamakoti wants to see one IPO per month from the IITM startup ecosystem. “If IIT Madras can’t do it, I don’t think India can,” he said.Speaking at the event, another faculty member added that this initiative is likely the first such VC fund by an Indian academic institution aimed exclusively at nurturing its startup ecosystem.“We hope this will give rise to dozens of Tarun Mehtas,” they said, referring to the Ather Energy cofounder and IITM alumnus.The announcement comes at a time when IIT Madras has emerged as one of the country’s most prolific academic incubators, credited with spawning deeptech ventures across electric mobility, AI, and space tech. The fund is expected to institutionalise that pipeline and scale it with alumni-backed capital.","IIT Madras is setting up a Rs 200 crore venture capital fund to invest in startups emerging from the institution.

Who is Nehal Modi and his links to the

PNB scam

Nehal Modi, the younger brother of fugitive businessman Nirav Modi , was arrested by US authorities following an extradition request from Indian agencies. His arrest took place on 4 July after the Enforcement Directorate (ED) and the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) jointly requested his extradition, according to the United States department of justice.Authorities are seeking his custody on two charges: one of money laundering under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) 2002, and another of criminal conspiracy under the Indian Penal Code (IPC). He is accused of playing a major role in the alleged Rs 13,000 crore Punjab National Bank (PNB) scam, one of the biggest banking frauds in the country's history.Nehal Deepak Modi was born and brought up in Antwerp, Belgium, and is fluent in English, Gujarati and Hindi.Nehal, 46, is a key accused in the PNB scam, alongside his brother Nirav Modi and their uncle Mehul Choksi. Investigators said that Nehal helped Nirav move and hide large amounts of illegal money through fake companies and overseas transactions.In the scam, Nehal, through his companies, siphoned off almost Rs 6,498 crore from the bank, fraudulently obtaining Letters of Undertaking (LoUs), while his uncle used a similar method to misappropriate the remaining amount.He has also been accused of destroying evidence and helping Nirav Modi “knowingly and intentionally” after the scam was exposed.The CBI accused Nehal Modi of threatening and pressuring directors of shell companies in Dubai, which were used by Nirav Modi to make fraudulent trade dealings appear legitimate.ED claimed that after the scam came to light, Nehal, along with, Mihir R Bhansali, a close confidante of Nirav Modi, transported 50 kg of gold and ""substantial cash from Dubai."" He further instructed dummy directors not to reveal his identity to investigating authorities.Nehal has been named as accused No. 27 in a supplementary chargesheet filed by the CBI, which alleges that he destroyed evidence in Dubai to help conceal the suspected criminal conspiracy.According to investigators, these individuals, employees of Nirav Modi’s companies, were forced to move from Dubai to Cairo, where their phones, laptops, and computer servers were destroyed to eliminate evidence. They were also allegedly made to sign false declarations claiming to be the actual owners of Dubai and Hong Kong-based firms.These shell companies were shown as conducting genuine export-import business with three of Nirav Modi’s firms: Diamonds R Us, Solar Exports, and Stellar Diamonds. These entities are accused of wrongfully receiving buyer’s credit from foreign banks, backed by fake Letters of Undertaking (LoUs) fraudulently issued by PNB’s Brady House branch in Mumbai, with the help of bank insiders.The extradition hearing is scheduled for 17 July 2025, when a status conference will be held. Nehal may apply for bail during this session, but US prosecutors have already said they will oppose it.","Nehal Deepak Modi was born and brought up in Antwerp, Belgium, and is fluent in English, Gujarati and Hindi.

ITR Deadline Extension: What I-T Department Has Said

ITRs for Assessment Year 2025-26 feature significant modifications in structure and content, designed to streamline the compliance process, improve transparency and ensure precise reporting.

Due to these alterations, additional duration is required for developing systems, integrating components and evaluating the associated utilities.

Additionally, credits originating from Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) statements, which must be submitted by May 31, 2025, are anticipated to appear in early June, thus restricting the available timeframe for return submission without such an extension.

ITR filing FY 2024-25: It’s the month of July and every year this time, taxpayers are usually scrambling to get together documents to file their income tax return or ITR. However, those who file ITR-2 or ITR-3 have not yet been able to start the process of ITR filing since the utilities have not yet been released online (incometax.gov.in) or offline by the tax department.However, taxpayers have little reason to worry since this year the Income Tax Department has extended the deadline to file ITR from July 31 to September 15, 2025. Experts expect the ITR-2 and ITR-3 forms to be released soon.E xperts are of the view that the extensive changes in the Income Tax Return forms and the complexity of ITR-2 and ITR-3 has possibly caused the delay in release from the Income Tax Department’s end.Sonu Iyer, Partner and National Leader People Advisory Services - Tax, EY India explains, “The ITR-2 / ITR-3 return forms are applicable for individuals with complex financial profiles such as income from multiple house properties, capital gains, foreign assets and foreign income, business or professional income (in the case of ITR-3), directorships, unlisted equity shares, total income exceeding INR 5 million, brought forward and carry forward of losses, etc.Also Read | Income Tax Return e-filing: Can you keep switching between new and old tax regime every year?

The delay in releasing the e-filing utility (online and offline) for ITR-2 / ITR-3 can be attributed to the substantive changes introduced in the return forms such as separate reporting of capital gains earned before and after 23 July 2024, detailed reporting of deductions / exemptions, reporting of TDS section codes, etc,” Sonu Iyer tells TOI.According to the EY tax expert, such changes require comprehensive technical modifications to align the utility with the enhanced reporting requirements and provisions of the Finance Act, 2024.The Income Tax Department has extended the deadline for filing returns to 15 September 2025 recognizing the time required to update the utilities and the time required for system readiness,” she adds.* Salary/pension earnings* Revenue from multiple residential properties* Any amount of capital gains* Overseas income or assets* Agricultural proceeds exceeding Rs.5,000* Those with RNOR/NRI status* Company directors or holders of unlisted equity* Cases involving combined spousal incomePersons earning from business or professional activitiesExcel-based utility now accommodates revised return submissions under Section 139(8A).Also Read | ITR e-filing AY 2025-25: What is Annual Information Statement (AIS) and how is it different from Form 26AS?

Scholar Before Stateswoman



Prime Minister Narendra Modi met his Indian roots Trinidad and Tobago counterpart Kamla Persad-Bissessar on Friday (Thursday in T&T) and called her “Bihar ki Beti” (daughter of Bihar), spotlighting her ancestral roots in Bihar’s Buxar district.While addressing a community event during PM Modi's visit, Bissessar praised PM Modi and recited his poem from his book 'Aankh Aa Dhanya Chhe'.Kamla Persad-Bissessar is the first woman to serve as Prime Minister of Trinidad and Tobago, a Caribbean nation. Born on April 4, 1952, in Siparia, southern Trinidad, she has also held the positions of Attorney General and leader of the opposition, becoming the first woman in the country to hold each of these roles. According to her official profile on the World Economic Forum, she has been the political leader of the united national congress (UNC) since January 2010.Before entering national politics, Persad-Bissessar served as an alderman and later made her way to Parliament as the representative from Siparia in 1995. Over the years, she held several cabinet positions, including Attorney General, Minister of Legal Affairs, and Minister of Education.Kamla Persad-Bissessar has deep ancestral ties to India — more specifically, to Bhelupur village in Bihar’s Buxar district. In 2012, she visited her village during a private trip and called it one of the most emotional moments of her life. Welcomed with traditional Bihari folk songs, flower garlands, and heartfelt celebrations, she had told the villagers: “I feel I’ve come home.”Her contributions have not only earned her acclaim in Trinidad and Tobago but also recognition in India. In 2012, she was conferred the Pravasi Bharatiya Samman — the highest honour for overseas Indians — by then President Pratibha Patil, acknowledging her outstanding leadership and her efforts in strengthening India-Trinidad ties.Kamla Persad-Bissessar earned a Bachelor of Arts and a Diploma in Education from the University of the West Indies, followed by a law degree from Hugh Wooding Law School, where she was ranked top of her class.She later completed an Executive MBA from the Arthur Lok Jack Graduate School of Business in Trinidad in 2006.Before stepping into politics, Persad-Bissessar spent over six years in academics — teaching at the University of the West Indies, St Andrew High School in Jamaica, and serving as a Consultant Lecturer at the Jamaica College of Insurance. She also worked as a social worker with the Church of England Children's Society in London, combining compassion with intellect long before entering Parliament.","Kamla Persad-Bissessar is the first woman to serve as Prime Minister of Trinidad and Tobago, a Caribbean nation.

Vietnam economy: Soars to 7.52% growth in first half of 2025; exports boom despite Trump tariff deal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/vietnam-economy-soars-to-7-52-growth-in-first-half-of-2025-exports-boom-despite-trump-tariff-deal/articleshow/122266612.cms,"This is an AI-generated image, used for representational purposes only.

Vietnam’s economy grew 7.52 per cent in the first half of 2025, its highest pace in over a decade, on the back of strong exports and despite global uncertainties, the General Statistics Office (GSO) announced on Saturday.This comes just days after Hanoi secured relief from the steepest tariffs threatened by US President Donald Trump.According to GSO, the GDP expansion between January and June marked the fastest first-half growth since 2011, with the second quarter alone growing 7.96 per cent year-on-year.""Our country's socio-economic performance... achieved very positive results, approaching the set target in the context of many uncertainties in the world and regional economy,"" the GSO said in its statement, as per news agency AFP.Vietnam, a key global manufacturing hub, had reported 7.1 per cent growth in 2024 and is targeting an ambitious 8 per cent in 2025. The new figures put the country well on track, driven largely by soaring exports, which reached $219.83 billion in the first half, a 14.4 per cent year-on-year rise.Processed industrial goods made up nearly 90 per cent of this total.This export momentum gained further significance after Hanoi reached a trade deal with Washington that capped most tariffs at 20 per cent, avoiding the earlier threatened rate of 46 per cent.The deal also opened Vietnam’s market to US goods at zero tariffs. However, a 40 per cent tariff remains in place for ""transshipped"" goods, those moving through Vietnam to evade origin-country tariffs, a move aimed largely at Chinese products, as per the New York Times.Vietnam is the US’s largest export partner in Southeast Asia, with shipments to America valued at $70.91 billion in the first half alone, according to GSO data.The US is also Vietnam’s biggest trade partner after China and Mexico.While the new tariffs are significantly lower than what Trump had originally proposed, they are still five times higher than previous levels, as per Bloomberg.Uncertainty remains over how these tariffs will impact supply chains, especially given Vietnam’s heavy reliance on Chinese inputs for manufacturing.""With the new 20 per cent tariff, we think the government will speed up industrial upgrading and shift exports from low-margin goods to higher value-added products such as semiconductors,"" Fitch Solutions said in a note, highlighting upside risks to its 2025 GDP forecast of 6.4 per cent, according to news agency Reuters.Investment firm Dragon Capital’s founder Dominic Scriven also described the trade deal as “net-positive,” stating that fears of a more damaging blow had been avoided. “With external trade risk now moderating, attention can return to the country’s core growth engine, the domestic and private sector economy,” he said.Vietnam’s industrial production grew 10.3 per cent during the April-June quarter, and consumer inflation in June stood at 3.57 per cent, according to official data.The country's efforts to reorganise its administrative setup by merging several provinces and cities last month were also cited by GSO as part of broader socio-economic development plans.Still, concerns persist over the longer-term implications of the new US trade terms.As per the New York Times, ambiguities remain over which Vietnamese products will be considered transshipped or excessively reliant on Chinese inputs, potentially subjecting them to the harsher 40 per cent levy.Trump, in his announcement, characterised the new pact as a “Great Deal of Cooperation,” though critics argued the tariffs, ultimately paid by US importers, would still impose a burden on American businesses and consumers.","Vietnam’s economy grew 7.52 per cent in the first half of 2025, its highest pace in over a decade.

Spot the fake ones out: Labubu or Lafufu?

These knock-offs are fooling even the most alert collectors, despite Pop Mart's efforts to stop the spread.Pop Mart, the Beijing-based brand behind the popular Labubu dolls, uses QR codes and barcode checks to confirm if a toy is genuine. But as one Chennai-based content creator found out, even these steps aren't always enough.“I had picked up a Labubu for myself and had done an unboxing video which got a lot of views,” said the creator, who did not want to be named. “I thought it would be fun to do a video with my whole family unboxing their Labubus, so I picked up a pack of six. We did an unboxing video and even authenticated the product,"" ET quoted the influencer.She followed Pop Mart’s instructions by scanning the QR code and entering the barcode digits. Her toys passed the test. But later, an eagle-eyed collector noticed something was off, the website itself was fake, and her toys were actually Lafufus.Even though she later replaced the fake with a real Labubu, she took it in her stride.“Lafufus have their own fan base too!” she said.Labubu dolls, small figures with pointy ears, big eyes, and nine-toothed grins, first appeared in 2019 and quickly became a craze. Sold in “blind boxes,” these toys cost between $20 and $30 but can fetch much higher prices. One life-sized version recently sold at a Beijing auction for a record $150,000 (about Rs 1.28 crore).As demand soars, so does the counterfeit trade. Last month, Chinese customs seized over 46,000 fake Labubu toys. State media warned of a growing black market hurting both consumers and creators.Pop Mart’s sales have skyrocketed thanks to Labubu’s popularity. Since going public in Hong Kong in 2020, the company’s founder Wang Ning has become one of China’s top ten billionaires, with a net worth of $22 billion.But Lafufus are gaining ground. They cost as little as $7.50 and are seen by many as a cheaper way to join the trend.“The fakes have become so good,” said Abbas Zaveri, founder of HypeFly, a marketplace for sneakers and collectibles told ET.“Things that customers could look out for is that the heads of the lafufus tend to be very flimsy and the font on the box generally is embossed but the quality on the boxes of fakes tend to be sub-par.”Zaveri further added that despite the original pack for 6 costs more than Rs 24,000, some Indian websites are selling it for just Rs 9,000.Nikhil Jain, who runs City Kicks India, believes the problem is widespread. “About 70–80% of the dolls in the Indian market are Lafufus,” he said. “The site URL had subtle misspellings like ""Pop Mari"" or ""Poap Mart"" which are good tell-tale signs for this fraud. There are some marketplaces that have had to set up a team to authenticate their products because earlier they sold them as originals and customers figured out that they were being charged for an original but received a lafufu instead. ”The issue isn’t limited to India. In Scotland, consumer group Advice Direct Scotland warned that fake Labubus are tricking families and upsetting children.“These counterfeits are not only deceiving collectors and draining hard-earned money from families, but they are also leaving children heartbroken,” said Hazel Knowles, consumer project lead at the organisation. “We urge consumers to be vigilant, buy only from trusted retailers and report suspected fakes.”","Pop Mart, the Beijing-based brand behind the popular Labubu dolls, uses QR codes and barcode checks to confirm if a toy is genuine.

Donald Trump's Tariff Plan: ‘Take it or leave it’

Challenges in Finalising Trade Deals

Donald Trump’s tariff deadline: Ahead of his self-imposed deadline on reciprocal tariffs, US President Donald Trump has said that 12 countries will be getting letters Monday onwards detailing their tariff rates.It is yet unclear which twelve countries have been finalized by the US for new reciprocal tariff rates, which will reportedly be effective from August 1, 2025. Trump’s announcement comes at a time when India and the US are in discussions to finalise a trade deal. Indian officials, on a visit to Washington for trade deal talks, have returned. India has also indicated that it does not believe in agreeing to trade deals based on deadlines.During his journey to New Jersey on Air Force One, Trump spoke to journalists but withheld the names of the recipient countries, stating this information would be revealed on Monday.Also Read | India-US trade deal: 'Don't make deals based on deadlines, national interest paramount', says Piyush Goyal as Donald Trump's tariff date nears Initially, Trump had indicated to reporters that the first set of letters would be distributed on Friday, which was a national holiday in the United States, but this timeline was subsequently altered.""I signed some letters and they'll go out on Monday, probably twelve,"" Trump said according to a Reuters report when questioned about his tariff strategy.""Different amounts of money, different amounts of tariffs.""According to the report, Trump’s letters will be sent with the American side indicating a ‘take it or leave it’ offers.Amidst a global trade conflict that has disrupted financial markets and prompted policymakers to protect their economies, Trump introduced in April a baseline 10% tariff rate plus supplementary charges for most nations, with some reaching up to 50%.Subsequently, all rates above the 10% baseline were temporarily suspended for 90 days to facilitate negotiation opportunities.Also Read | 'Reserve the right to suspend...': Amidst trade deal talks, India proposes retaliatory duties against US at WTO; here’s what the issue is about This suspension period concludes on July 9, though Trump indicated early on Friday that tariffs could now potentially reach 70%, with most taking effect from August 1.The US president and his senior officials had initially planned to engage in tariff rate discussions with many nations. However, after facing multiple challenges with major trading allies, including Japan and the European Union, Trump has become less enthusiastic about this approach.On Friday evening, he briefly commented to journalists: ""The letters are better ... much easier to send a letter.""He remained silent regarding his earlier forecast about finalising broader trade deals before July 9.Also Read | What is Donald Trump’s net worth?

The first, with Britain in May, maintained a 10% rate and provided special considerations for specific industries, notably automobiles and aircraft engines.The second agreement, with Vietnam, reduced tariffs on numerous Vietnamese products from 46% to 20%, whilst allowing many American goods to enter Vietnam without duties.The anticipated agreement with India has not come to fruition yet, and European Union diplomats reported on Friday that discussions with the Trump administration have reached an impasse. They are now considering extending current arrangements to prevent increases in tariff rates.","US President Donald Trump has said that 12 countries will be getting letters detailing their tariff rates.

"Oil market watch: Saudi, Russia-led OPEC+ eyes fresh hike for August; focus to likely shift from price stability to market share",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/oil-market-watch-saudi-russia-led-opec-eyes-fresh-hike-for-august-focus-to-likely-shift-from-price-stability-to-market-share/articleshow/122260781.cms,"AI image

Saudi Arabia, Russia and six other major oil producers from the OPEC+ alliance will meet on Saturday to decide their crude output strategy for August, with analysts expecting the bloc to approve another production hike of 411,000 barrels per day (bpd), mirroring decisions made for May, June and July.The meeting will be held virtually and will include representatives from Iraq, the UAE, Kuwait, Kazakhstan, Algeria and Oman, according to news agency AFP.The so-called “Voluntary Eight” (V8) group within OPEC+ had earlier stunned markets by reversing course from prolonged supply cuts and opting to raise production sharply from May onwards.This shift has pulled down oil prices to a narrow band of $65–$70 per barrel, far below the highs seen earlier during Middle East tensions.Analysts cited by AFP say that the alliance appears increasingly focused on reclaiming market share over price stability. “The group has placed an increased focus on regaining market shares over price stability,” said Saxo Bank analyst Ole Hansen, highlighting the competitive pressure from rising supply elsewhere, including the United States.Despite the scheduled hike, actual supply additions could fall short.As per AFP, Rystad Energy’s Jorge Leon said that the real increase might be only 250,000–300,000 bpd, much like May’s 200,000 bpd gain, despite doubled quotas. This shortfall is partly due to non-compliance by countries like Kazakhstan and Iraq, whose production exceeded agreed limits.UBS analyst Giovanni Staunovo added that such inconsistencies may be pushing leading producers like Saudi Arabia to tighten enforcement via output-driven price pressure.While market watchers are bracing for the expected rise, there is little anticipation of price shocks, especially as geopolitical concerns have eased. A recent 12-day conflict between Iran and Israel, which had temporarily pushed prices over $80, didn’t cause supply disruptions.“Given there were no supply disruptions so far, the war is unlikely to impact the decision,” Staunovo said, as cited by AFP. Hansen echoed that the conflict could even justify faster production increases if Iran’s exports face future hurdles.According to news agency Reuters, earlier, some OPEC+ insiders believed that the group could consider a hike larger than 411,000 bpd. But consensus still leans toward a continuation of the current pace, especially as Brent futures hovered around $68.30 per barrel and WTI near $66.50 in holiday-thinned trade ahead of the meeting.Analysts such as Tamas Varga of PVM warned that additional output, if sustained, may swell global oil inventories in the second half of the year. “Oil balance estimates will be reassessed and will suggest accelerated swelling in global oil reserves,” Varga said, as quoted by Reuters.The eight OPEC+ countries have already committed to raising production by 1.37 million bpd over four months, roughly 62% of the 2.2 million bpd they initially pledged to cut. With US nuclear talks with Iran possibly resuming and global economic policies shifting, the alliance’s strategy is under growing scrutiny.Still, Saturday’s meeting is not expected to trigger any major market volatility, as traders are largely in a “wait-and-see mode”, said Price Futures Group’s Phil Flynn, who cited upcoming US fiscal changes and lingering tariff uncertainty as additional variables, according to Reuters.","OPEC+ to meet on Saturday to decide output strategy for August.

Why it matters

The big picture

What happens next, he warns, could be one of three scenarios:

A politically unpopular slashing of spending.

A massive increase in taxes.

Or a monetary intervention involving printing more money and lowering interest rates - which would “devalue the dollar and hurt bondholders.”

Between the lines

Zoom in

What they are saying

Dalio sees systemic risk not just for America, but for the global economy: “The US Treasury market is the backbone of all capital markets, which are the backbones of our economic and social conditions.” If confidence in US debt erodes, the entire financial architecture could wobble.

Ken Rogoff, former chief economist of the IMF, agrees: “It’s not clear markets will tolerate” further borrowing sprees when a real crisis hits. He warned that the US is leaving itself without fiscal headroom to respond to future emergencies.

Even the dollar - long considered a safe haven - is starting to reflect these jitters. It just posted its worst first-half performance since 1973, a signal that foreign investors may be losing confidence in the US fiscal trajectory.

The Trump administration’s view

The math doesn’t add up - at least not for Dalio

Catch up quick

Congress passed the bill 218–214 after weeks of internal GOP wrangling.

The Senate version was made law with Vice President JD Vance casting the tie-breaking vote.

The CBO estimates 11.8 million Americans will lose health coverage and 3 million will lose food stamp eligibility by 2034.

Some Republicans expressed discomfort with the deficits - then voted yes anyway.

What’s next

President Donald Trump’s newly passed $3.4 trillion tax and spending package - dubbed by supporters as “One Big Beautiful Bill” - is being denounced by Wall Street figures, economists, and bond market analysts as a fiscal time bomb. Among the most vocal: Ray Dalio, founder of Bridgewater Associates, who says the bill will lead to “big, painful disruptions” for American families and the global financial system if not urgently reversed.The legislation, passed with razor-thin margins in Congress, is expected to add $3.4 trillion to the national deficit over the next decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office. It comes at a time of relative economic stability - not a war, recession, or pandemic. Critics argue that deficit spending without crisis justification marks a dangerous shift in American fiscal policy.Dalio breaks it down in stark terms: annual federal spending will balloon to around $7 trillion, while revenues will hover near $5 trillion. “The debt... is now about 6x of the money taken in, 100 percent of GDP, and about $230,000 per American family,” Dalio wrote. In ten years, those numbers could rise to “7.5x the money taken in, 130 percent of GDP, and $425,000 per family.”This isn’t just theoretical. Rising federal debt will demand more borrowing, and that means higher interest and principal payments. Dalio estimates that those costs will soar from $10 trillion today to $18 trillion - with annual interest alone doubling to $2 trillion.The bond market - where the US borrows money - has already begun sending distress signals. Yields on long-term Treasurys jumped in May, nearing their highest levels in two decades, reflecting unease over the government’s fiscal trajectory.Bill Gross, founder of Pimco and one of the bond market’s most respected voices, likened the US to “a teenager with a credit card that has no limits.” He warned that the payment is coming - not via default, but through “a weak dollar and higher interest rates.”The Wall Street Journal, in an in-depth analysis, highlighted the extraordinary nature of the moment: a historic deficit without a national emergency. Typically, large-scale federal borrowing is reserved for times of crisis - like the 2008 financial collapse or the Covid pandemic.This time is different. “The market has been willing to tolerate spikes in borrowing during crises... What stands out now... is that America is bingeing on debt when there’s no such emergency requiring it,” the WSJ noted.Moody’s projects that the deficit, already at $1.8 trillion (6% of GDP), will climb to nearly 9% by 2035. That would push the national debt from just under 100% of GDP today to more than 130% - surpassing even World War II-era highs.President Trump and Republican lawmakers say the bill’s $4.5 trillion in tax cuts will supercharge economic growth. They argue that cuts to Medicaid, food stamps, and green energy subsidies are essential to ""rightsizing"" government.“For all cost-cutting Republicans, of which I am one, REMEMBER, you still have to get reelected,” Trump posted online. “We will make it all up, times 10, with GROWTH, more than ever before.”They also tout provisions such as new deductions for tips and overtime, a hike in the child tax credit, and business incentives to spur investment. Trump calls the bill “a phenomenal victory” and plans to sign it on July 4th.Dalio doesn’t buy the growth-will-save-us logic. He warns that the exploding interest burden will force the Fed to either crush the economy with higher rates or suppress rates artificially - triggering inflation and dollar devaluation.The scenario he paints is bleak: “Unless this path is soon rectified to bring the budget deficit from roughly 7% of GDP to about 3%... big, painful disruptions will likely occur.”That includes a potential bond market revolt, skyrocketing borrowing costs for households and businesses, and a shrinking safety net just as economic headwinds build.Markets are watching closely. The Fed, already navigating post-pandemic economic turbulence, may have to intervene if long-term rates spike. That could limit its ability to fight inflation or support growth.Foreign investors, who hold nearly one-third of US public debt, may start reallocating to other safer assets. As Harvard economist Jeremy Stein puts it, “I wouldn’t be surprised... if they start shifting that reinvestment more towards, say, Europe or German bonds.”The cost of Trump’s “big, beautiful” bill may not be fully visible today - but Dalio and Wall Street are betting we’ll all feel it tomorrow.(With inputs from agencies)","Congress passed $3.4 trillion tax and spending package - dubbed by supporters as ‘One Big Beautiful Bill’ Critics argue that deficit spending without crisis justification marks a dangerous shift in American fiscal policy. Ray Dalio, founder of Bridgewater Associates, says the bill will lead to “big, painful disruptions” for American families and the global financial system if not urgently reversed.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122253143,imgsize-2996525,width-400,resizemode-4/122253143.jpg"
"Trump’s 'big, beautiful bill': Why it's making China laugh",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/trumps-big-beautiful-bill-why-its-making-china-laugh-and-stronger/articleshow/122252330.cms,"FULL: Trump's Stunning Victory Speech After 'Big, Beautiful' Win In U.S. Cong | Watch

“There has never been a more intimate connection between a nation’s ability to generate huge amounts of electricity at affordable prices... and its economic and military might,” the New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman wrote this week. ""The Chinese can’t believe their luck.""

Why it matters

The big picture

Trump’s bill quickly phases out tax credits for utility-scale wind and solar projects and cuts incentives for electric vehicle buyers years ahead of schedule.

The bill adds intricate restrictions on battery tax credits that exclude companies tied to “prohibited foreign entities” like China-ironically making the credits near-impossible to claim.

The bill also kills the methane fee from the Inflation Reduction Act and delays permitting for key grid upgrades, all while locking in $4.5 trillion in tax cuts, $1.2 trillion in safety net reductions, and $350 billion in hardline immigration and military spending.

Friedman summed it up sharply: “In one fell swoop, this bill will make your home hotter, your air conditioning bill higher, your clean energy job scarcer, America’s auto industry weaker and China happier.”

Zoom in: Texas shows the stakes

What they’re saying:

Elon Musk: “Utterly insane and destructive.”

Nick Nigro, WSJ: “The big-picture outlook for energy is we are going to be less competitive because of this law.”

Ray Dalio : “This will lead to unimaginable tax increases or a lot of printing and devaluing of money.”

: “This will lead to unimaginable tax increases or a lot of printing and devaluing of money.” Thomas Friedman: “China may have to make July 4 its own national holiday going forward: American Electricity Dependence Day.”

Between the lines

Debt dangers

Beyond energy, the bill also obliterates fiscal sanity. Ray Dalio, founder of Bridgewater Associates, warns that the legislation pushes America deeper into a debt spiral that could crash credit markets and destabilize the global economy.

The bill’s $4.5 trillion in tax cuts and defense spending will add another $3.4 trillion to the deficit by 2034, per the Congressional Budget Office. Government debt is now projected to hit 130% of GDP within a decade. That’s worse than the US level after World War II.

Dalio didn’t mince words: “Unless this path is soon rectified… big, painful disruptions will likely occur.” His concern? That interest payments will balloon to $2 trillion annually, forcing a mix of inflation, tax hikes, and spending cuts that gut the economy.

The bill also adds $3.3 trillion to the deficit, with Ray Dalio warning it will erode investor confidence and increase financial instability. “This path is unsustainable,” Dalio said.

What’s next

Trump calls it “beautiful.” But to Beijing, it’s miraculous. Friedman put it bluntly: “There are only two political parties in the world today cheering the passage of this bill: Trump’s Republican Party and the Chinese Communist Party.”

On July 4, while Americans celebrated their independence, China may be celebrating something else: the greatest gift Washington has handed it in decades.President Donald Trump’s newly passed “One Big Beautiful Bill”-a sprawling 869-page tax and spending law-does more than enshrine his second-term agenda. It delivers a devastating blow to America’s renewable energy industry at the exact moment artificial intelligence is fueling a global electricity arms race. And it gives President Xi Jinping and China a clear runway to dominate that future.Experts say this may be one of the most self-destructive energy policies in modern history. “It gives handouts to industries of the past while severely damaging industries of the future,” Tesla CEO Elon Musk said. China, meanwhile, is doubling down on solar, wind, and battery power, preparing to lead the next economic era.Friedman warned in the New York Times: “This dog’s breakfast of a bill… is sure to put at risk billions of dollars of investments in renewable energy… and potentially kill the jobs of tens of thousands of US workers.”Texas has quietly become America’s top clean power state.A Texas A&M report showed the state added 2,596 MW of solar, wind, and battery storage in just one quarter, overtaking California for the top spot.Texas grid expert Doug Lewin posted last week that the state added 10,000 megawatts of new power last year, mostly solar-plus-battery. “Brownouts are down,” he said, “and reliability is up.”But under Trump’s bill, future projects will be more expensive, slower to build, and potentially ineligible for tax credits. That means higher costs for utilities-and for families. “Now the electricity will cost consumers a lot more,” Lewin warned.The bill’s energy policies not only conflict with America’s innovation trajectory-they also defy global trends. Saudi Arabia is building solar farms to power AI data centers. Even fossil-fuel giants are investing in green energy for strategic advantage.China is using a different playbook. In 2000, it produced 1,300 terawatt-hours of electricity. Now it generates over 10,000, while the US has only added 500 terawatt-hours in the same time. China’s growth is increasingly coming from wind, solar, hydro, and battery projects-not coal.A Financial Times report from Shanghai described China’s strategic evolution into an “electrostate”-a nation powered by clean electricity and buffered against trade wars and geopolitical shocks, Friedman said in his NYT column.Tariff trouble: Trump’s steel and aluminum tariffs could drive up the cost and delay deployment of gas turbines and renewables even further.AI grid crunch: With AI data centers consuming vast amounts of electricity, grid expansion is urgent. But Trump’s bill delays and obstructs transmission upgrades-slowing economic growth.Job losses: Research firm Energy Innovation projects the bill will increase wholesale electricity prices by 50% by 2035, raise household energy costs by $16 billion annually by 2030, and eliminate or prevent 830,000 renewable jobs.(With inputs from agencies)","President Donald Trump’s newly passed “One Big Beautiful Bill” does more than enshrine his second-term agenda.

China moves to stop ‘involution’

China’s government is stepping in to cool down the fierce price war in its electric vehicle (EV) market, as concerns over oversupply, shrinking margins, and industry instability grow.After years of aggressive industrial policy driving EV adoption, China's electric vehicle market has become the largest in the world. But it now hosts more automakers than the market can sustain, prompting fears of a bubble and unprofitable competition, reported AP.Market leader BYD reported strong sales growth, a 31% jump in the first half of the year to 2.1 million vehicles, but the company’s aggressive pricing strategy has drawn criticism. Nearly half of those sales were pure electric vehicles, with the rest being plug-in hybrids. BYD stopped selling internal combustion engine cars in 2022.On May 23, BYD slashed prices across more than 20 models, setting off a fresh round of EV price cuts in China. That same day, Great Wall Motors Chairman Wei Jianjun warned of unhealthy market dynamics, comparing the situation to the downfall of real estate giant Evergrande.. “The Evergrande in the automobile industry already exists, but it is just yet to explode,” he said.BYD quickly responded, rejecting the comparison. Brand executive Li Yunfei defended the company in a strongly worded social media post, calling the remarks “confusing” and “ridiculous.”Following the dispute, China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology vowed to address what it called “involution” competition, referring to destructive, zero-sum market behavior. Meanwhile, the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers urged fair competition, noting that drastic price cuts had sparked panic across the industry.“That price cut might have been the final straw that irked both competitors and regulators for the ruthlessness that BYD continues to show,” said independent analyst Lei Xing.In June, 17 Chinese automakers, including BYD, pledged to pay suppliers within 60 days, marking a significant shift. Many EV companies have been stretching out payments or issuing IOUs to suppliers — a risky practice that mirrors tactics used by developers like Evergrande before the real estate crash.Will EV demand hold as prices stabilise?Analysts say these government efforts, along with cutbacks on financing deals and warnings against predatory pricing, are meant to stabilize the market and support long-term growth.With overseas sales rising, BYD exported 464,000 vehicles in the first half of 2025, and global tariffs increasing, China’s EV industry faces a turning point at home and abroad.","China's electric vehicle market has become the largest in the world.

Emirates is shifting its strategic focus away from India due to long standing bilateral restrictions that have prevented the airline from expanding its operations in the country.Adnan Kazim, deputy president and chief commercial officer of Emirates, told ET that India, once among the airline’s top five global markets, has now slipped to the top 10. The main reason, he said, is the cap on seat entitlements under the current air services agreement between India and Dubai.As per the agreement, UAE carriers, including Emirates, are allowed a total of 65,000 weekly seats to India, with a reciprocal limit for Indian carriers flying to Dubai. These limits have remained unchanged for over a decade despite a sharp increase in outbound travel from India.""All 171 weekly frequencies we operate to India are flying above 95% seat factor,"" said Kazim as per ET. ""We're spilling traffic. The demand far exceeds the supply.""Due to the inability to expand in India, Emirates is redirecting its growth to other regions. ""We've been growing consistently, year after year, by at least 3-5%,"" Kazim said.""But we've not been able to add a single seat to India since 2014-nearly 11 years.”Emirates has since increased capacity and added destinations in Asia, the Americas, Europe, Africa, and the Middle East. ""That could've been India playing that role... but it's not the case,"" Kazim noted.He said Emirates remains open to partnerships with Indian carriers, but such tie-ups offer limited value unless seat entitlements are increased.""Flights are already full. A partner cannot add much in that situation."" he explained.Kazim also expressed interest in expanding into Tier 2 Indian cities. However, those plans are on hold due to the same restrictions.Pointing to the potential of the Indian market, Kazim highlighted the relatively low international travel volumes. “You're moving about 120 million international passengers with a population of 1.5 billion. That number should be much higher."" he said.","Emirates is shifting its strategic focus away from India due to long standing bilateral restrictions.

Dollar weakness raises red flags



Trump’s actions adds to uncertainty

The US dollar has dropped more than 10 per cent in the first half of 2025, marking its sharpest six-month decline since 1973, and sparking fresh warnings from economists and currency experts about the potential for heightened financial market volatility.Despite a full rebound in US stock markets, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq recently hitting record highs, the falling dollar and surging long-term treasury yields point to growing investor concerns over the stability of US financial assets. Analysts link the selloff to US President Donald Trump’s unpredictable economic policies and weakening confidence in the federal reserve.""It's US exceptionalism basically falling by the wayside and the rest of the world playing catch-up,"" said Erik Nelson, macro strategist at Wells Fargo, predicting continued dollar depreciation as other global economies catch up, according to AFP.The ICE US dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of major currencies, fell 10.7 per cent through June, its worst start to a year in over five decades.The euro has been a major beneficiary, gaining over 13 per cent this year thanks to Germany’s fiscal spending and ECB rate cuts.Economists say global investors are rethinking their reliance on the dollar as a safe haven currency. Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM US, called the current retreat the start of a “multi-year unwinding” of the dollar’s 14-year bull run.Harvard economist Kenneth Rogoff, author of Our Dollar Your Problem, pointed to a growing trend among central banks in China and other nations to diversify away from the dollar, a trend accelerated by Trump's policies.“I think we'll see a period of a lot of financial volatility, largely centered around the chaos in the United States,"" Rogoff said, citing threats to central bank independence and the rise of populism.The Trump administration has added to the volatility with conflicting signals on monetary and trade policy. Trump has publicly attacked fed chair Jerome Powell, demanding interest rates ""at least two to three points lower,"" and called Powell ""a stupid person.""While treasury secretary Scott Bessent denied aiming for a weak dollar, analysts say the trend fits with the administration’s manufacturing and onshoring strategy.""Lower interest rates and a weaker dollar would enable the US to strengthen its economic self-sufficiency and increase onshoring,"" reported AFP quoting Jason Schenker of Prestige Economics.In April, Trump reversed new tariffs announced just a week earlier after a surge in Treasury yields caused a stock market dip. He later said he had no plans to remove Powell, walking back earlier threats.So far, US equities remain strong, seemingly unaffected by the dollar’s drop. But some experts warn the situation could shift quickly.","US dollar has dropped more than 10 per cent in the first half of 2025, marking its sharpest six-month decline since 1973.

Asian markets showed mixed movement on Friday as investors treaded carefully ahead of a looming US tariff deadline set by President Donald Trump. The uncertainty overshadowed positive cues from Wall Street, where a strong US jobs report lifted major indexes to record highs.Trump told reporters Thursday that he planned to begin sending letters to trading partners detailing new tariffs, as his July 9 deadline approaches. “My inclination is to send a letter out and say what tariff they're going to be paying,” he said, adding that letters could start going out “probably tomorrow, maybe 10 a day.”The move follows his sweeping announcement of new levies on “Liberation Day” in early April, sparking a global rush for trade deals to avoid the tariffs. So far, only Britain and Vietnam have signed agreements, while China has reached a framework deal with Washington to reduce mutual tariffs and ease restrictions on some goods.As negotiations continue, investors worry that countries like Japan, South Korea, India, and Taiwan could soon face higher tariffs. The uncertainty weighed on markets across Asia. Tokyo, Shanghai, Sydney, Wellington, and Jakarta posted small gains, while Hong Kong, Seoul, Singapore, Taipei, and Manila ended lower.Despite these concerns, Wall Street closed strong ahead of the US Independence Day holiday. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq hit fresh record highs after US jobs data showed the economy added 147,000 jobs in June, above expectations, while unemployment fell to 4.1%.However, the upbeat headline figures masked underlying weakness, analysts warned. MUFG said hiring in the private sector appeared to be stalling, with more than 750,000 people having exited the labor force over the past two months. ""We continue to view labour demand as being fundamentally weak relative to the past several years,"" they noted.The labor data reduced expectations of a July interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve. Markets are now pricing in two rate cuts by year-end, the first likely in September.Meanwhile, the passage of Trump’s “Big, Beautiful Bill,” which extends major tax and spending cuts, added to market confusion. While the legislation includes a $5 trillion debt limit increase, preventing a potential US default, it is also projected to add $3 trillion to the national debt.","Tokyo, Shanghai, Sydney, Wellington, and Jakarta posted small gains.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.","Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain.

Startups will play important role in helping India become 3rd largest economy: CEA Nageswaran,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/startups-will-play-important-role-in-helping-india-become-3rd-largest-economy-cea-nageswaran/articleshow/105332523.cms,"Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor ( CEA ) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart.

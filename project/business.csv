Equirus downgraded Protean eGovernance to sell from add, and cut its target price massively to Rs 900 from Rs 1,730 after the company disclosed that it is no longer in contention for the govt’s PAN 2.0 project. Analysts said the govt had plans to overhaul PAN/TAN services under PAN 2.0 with a Rs 1,440 crore budget. Despite earlier confidence, Protean is now completely out of the running. They feel this is a material negative, as PAN services contribute ~50% of the company’s revenue. They also said that the impact of the govt decision could be muted in FY26, and expect a 75-100% collapse in this revenue stream over the next 2-3 years. This segment has historically generated free cash that funded new initiatives, which is now under threat. Additional headwinds include an impending NPS pricing revision in FY27 and stagnant ONDC retail volumes.Jefferies has a hold on Divis Laboratories with the target price at Rs 6,200. Analysts said Jan-March quarterly numbers were in line with estimates. The company currently has several projects at different stages of development belonging to GLP1/2, GIP and small molecule, but does not target the generic Semaglutide opportunity.The hold rating is also because of the near-term patent challenges and high valuation.Kotak Institutional Equities has a sell on BHEL with the target price at Rs 115. Analysts said the company missed its EBITDA estimates by 8%. And this was after adjusting for prior provisions that were reversed and supported by very strong industrial print that may not sustain. They feel the key disappointment was weak execution in the key power segment.CLSA has an outperform rating on Hyundai Motors India with the target price at Rs 2,155. Analysts said EBITDA margin came in at 14.1%, 200 basis points higher than the estimate led by higher-than-expected average selling price. This increase was driven by price hikes, a moderation in discounts, a rich product mix and government subsidies.Morgan Stanlet has downgraded HAL to equal weight with the target price at Rs 5,092. Analysts said margin and new order outlooks strong, but the market may be concerned about muted execution guidance. They feel risk-reward in the stock balanced, and hence it was downgraded to equal weight.","Equirus downgraded Protean eGovernance to sell from add, and cut its target price massively to Rs 900 from Rs 1,730.

Bharti's 4QFY25 performance was in-line. India wireless revenue/EBITDA grew ~1%/2% QoQ, offset by fewer days. Consol. net debt inched up by ~INR50b due to the redemption of USD1b perpetual bonds. We continue to favor BHARTI's superior execution on premiumization.Robust FCF of ~INR97b/ ~INR390b in Q4/FY25, along with moderating capex, should lead to significant FCF generation of ~INR1t in FY26-27E. We model a 14%/17% CAGR in Bharti's consolidated revenue/EBITDA (FY25-28E) driven by an expected ~15% India wireless tariff hike (Dec'25), faster home broadband growth, & continued strong double-digit growth in Africa.Varun Beverages delivered strong 1QCY24 performance with 29% YoY revenue growth, driven by robust 30% volume growth (15.5% organic). While margins remained flat YoY at 22.7% due to lower-margin South Africa consolidation, domestic demand stayed healthy with double-digit growth.VBL maintained its volume growth trajectory in the domestic market & its expansion in international markets. Management is confident about its double-digit growth guidance on the back of industry tailwinds and expansion into new markets.We project 18%/16%/26% revenue/EBITDA/PAT CAGRs over CY25-26.

China has instructed government officials nationwide to reduce unnecessary expenditure on travel, meals and office facilities, signalling President Xi Jinping 's commitment to fiscal prudence amidst challenging economic conditions affecting government finances.The regulations reinforce Xi's initiative for officials to reduce expenditure, particularly as declining land sale revenues constrain budgets whilst local administrations face substantial debt obligations.In late 2023, central authorities instructed government officials to embrace austerity measures, strengthening Xi's drive against corruption and ostentatious displays of affluence.Also Read | ‘Big ban’ actions: How India is shunning Pakistan and its allies like Turkey & Azerbaijan - top 5 measures According to the official Xinhua News Agency on Sunday, the directive from the government and Communist Party leadership specifically addressed spending on cigarettes, alcohol and receptions.The announcement emphasises the importance of practising careful spending and frugality whilst condemning excessive expenditure.

Asian stock markets slid on Monday and the US dollar weakened after Moody’s downgraded the United States’ last remaining triple-A sovereign credit rating, triggering renewed investor concerns about Washington’s rising debt burden.Moody’s cut the rating from Aaa to Aa1, citing “the increase over more than a decade in government debt and interest payment ratios to levels that are significantly higher than similarly rated sovereigns.” It warned US deficits could swell to nearly 9% of GDP by 2035, up from 6.4% last year, driven by ballooning interest payments, entitlement spending, and relatively weak revenue.The downgrade follows similar moves by S&P in 2011 and Fitch in 2023. Analysts noted the cut could increase yields on US Treasuries, raising borrowing costs for the federal government.Despite the development, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent downplayed the move, calling it “a lagging indicator” and blaming the previous administration. “We didn't get here in the past 100 days,” he told CNN. “It's the Biden administration and the spending that we have seen over the past four years that we inherited, 6.7 percent deficit-to-GDP, the highest when we weren't in a recession, not in a war.”White House communications director Steven Cheung also lashed out on social media, targeting Moody’s Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi. “Nobody takes his ‘analysis’ seriously. He has been proven wrong time and time again,” Cheung posted on X.The timing of the downgrade was politically sensitive, as President Donald Trump’s proposed tax and welfare bill failed to pass in Congress. Independent analysts estimate the package could have added over $4.8 trillion to the deficit over 10 years. Several Republican fiscal hawks opposed the legislation, prompting House Speaker Mike Johnson to promise another vote later this week.The financial markets, which had enjoyed gains last week after the US and China agreed to temporarily reduce trade tariffs, reacted swiftly. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng dropped 0.6% to 23,211.29, while Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 slipped 0.4% to 37,617.63. Shanghai’s Composite fell 0.2% to 3,361.55. Other markets in Seoul, Singapore, Sydney, Wellington, Taipei and Jakarta also closed lower. US futures were also down.Chinese retail data added to the gloom. April’s retail sales growth came in below expectations at 5.1%, reinforcing concerns over domestic demand despite recent stimulus measures. However, factory output showed some resilience with better-than-expected figures.Gold, benefiting from safe-haven demand, rose to $3,225 per ounce. The dollar slipped against major currencies, trading at 145.09 yen, while the euro rose to $1.1180.Still, some analysts believe the market impact of the downgrade will be limited. “Moody’s actions will have zero impact on any investor's ability or willingness to continue holding US Treasuries — that would likely require downgrades of four or five more notches,” said Ray Attrill of National Australia Bank.Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management added, “Moody’s may have dropped the mic, but for equity traders, the real test this week will be Main Street… the downgrade is more psychological than mechanical.”Key earnings from major US retailers like Target, Home Depot, and Lowe’s are expected later this week and could provide further insight into consumer strength amid economic uncertainty.","Moody’s cut the rating from Aaa to Aa1, citing “the increase over more than a decade in government debt and interest payment ratios to levels that are significantly higher than similarly rated sovereigns” It warned US deficits could swell to nearly 9% of GDP by 2035, up from 6.4% last year, driven by ballooning interest payments, entitlement spending, and relatively weak revenue.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121259473,imgsize-1380425,width-400,resizemode-4/121259473.jpg"
'Lagging indicator': US treasury secretary blames Biden-era spending for Moody’s credit downgrade,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/lagging-indicator-us-treasury-secretary-blames-biden-era-spending-for-moodys-credit-downgrade/articleshow/121251688.cms,"US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent (File photo)

NEW DELHI: US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Sunday dismissed Moody’s decision to downgrade the country’s credit rating, calling it “a lagging indicator” and attributing the development to fiscal policies under the Biden administration.Speaking on CNN, Bessent said the downgrade, which stripped the US of its final triple-A credit rating, reflected spending patterns from the previous four years. “We didn’t get here in the past 100 days,” he said, adding, “It’s the Biden administration and the spending that we have seen over the past four years that we inherited—6.7 per cent deficit-to-GDP, the highest when we weren’t in a recession, not in a war.”Bessent argued that the fiscal strain had been years in the making, citing the inherited deficit-to-GDP ratio as the most severe in peacetime or outside a recession.Moody’s announcement on Friday, however, pointed to broader concerns, including a sustained rise in federal debt levels spanning multiple administrations. The agency projected federal deficits would grow to nearly nine per cent of GDP by 2035, driven by mounting interest payments, rising entitlement costs, and insufficient revenue.Despite the downgrade, Bessent said the current administration was committed to fiscal responsibility . “We are determined to bring the spending down and grow the economy,” he said, maintaining that growth would ultimately outpace debt accumulation.Moody’s had been the last of the three major ratings agencies to maintain a triple-A rating for the US. S&P downgraded its rating in 2011, followed by Fitch in 2023.The credit rating cut comes amid economic uncertainty in Washington. President Donald Trump ’s proposal to extend his 2017 tax cuts—estimated at around $5 trillion—suffered a major setback after failing to clear a key vote in Congress.The plan faced opposition from Republican fiscal conservatives, who blocked its advancement, casting doubt on the bill’s future in the House of Representatives.Reacting to the downgrade, Republican Congressman French Hill, who chairs the House Financial Services Committee, said Moody’s move was a stark warning about the country’s fiscal trajectory. “This is a clear signal of the nation’s growing financial instability,” he said.","Moody’s had been the last of the three major ratings agencies to maintain a triple-A rating for the US.

"Global layoff spree: Microsoft, Amazon, Burberry among firms cutting jobs; thousands affected",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/global-layoff-spree-microsoft-amazon-burberry-among-firms-cutting-thousands-of-jobs/articleshow/121247440.cms,"Microsoft: Over 6,000 jobs slashed in structural overhaul

Amazon: Cuts in services and services sector

Panasonic: 10,000 jobs to go amid structural reforms

PwC: 1,500 US employees let go after business review

CrowdStrike: 5% workforce cut despite strong growth

Burberry: 1,700 jobs cut in bid to revive brand

In recent weeks, several multinational corporations across sectors, from technology and cybersecurity to fashion and consulting, have announced significant job cuts, impacting tens of thousands of workers globally. These layoffs are being driven by structural overhauls, cost-cutting strategies, and a sharper focus on profitability. Together, they signal a broader industry shift toward consolidation, leaner operations, and streamlined efficiency.Microsoft is laying off approximately 3% of its global workforce, affecting over 6,000 employees across departments and regions. The company, which had 228,000 staff as of June 2023, said that the move is aimed at streamlining operations and reducing management layers.The cuts mark the biggest reduction since Microsoft eliminated 10,000 jobs in 2023. However, unlike earlier performance-based layoffs, these are structural, targeting middle management to widen the span of control per manager. Coders and engineering staff are expected to be largely spared, as the company continues to prioritise AI investments.Microsoft also introduced stricter performance policies, including a two-year rehire ban for underperformers and a “good attrition” metric to track desirable exits. Employees placed on a performance improvement plan (PIP) must choose within five days or forgo severance.Amazon reportedly fired around 100 employees from its devices and services division, which develops hardware like Echo, Fire TV, and Ring. The layoffs are part of an internal review to better align teams with product roadmaps and improve overall efficiency.“As part of our ongoing work to make our teams and programs operate more efficiently, and to better align with our product roadmap, we’ve made the difficult decision to eliminate a small number of roles,” an Amazon spokesperson told Reuters.CEO Andy Jassy has also been vocal about reducing bureaucracy and management layers, recently informing about a 15% increase in the ratio of individual contributors to managers. He also stressed upon the importance of meritocracy over bureaucracy in Amazon's corporate culture, encouraging staff to do more with fewer resources.Panasonic is cutting 10,000 jobs, 4% of its global workforce, through the fiscal year ending March 2026. Half of the cuts will be in Japan, with the rest overseas. The layoffs are aimed at restructuring unprofitable divisions, particularly in consumer electronics.“Compared with industry peers that have already moved ahead with structural reforms, our selling, general and administrative expenses ratio remains exceptionally high,” said President Yuki Kusumi during a media briefing.The company will also merge sales and back-office functions to reduce fixed costs and may exit or sell off underperforming segments, including its struggling TV business. Panasonic expects to take an earnings hit of 130 billion yen (~$894 million) due to the restructuring.PwC has laid off about 2% of its US workforce, around 1,500 employees, mainly from its audit and tax teams, following an internal review. Many affected staff had joined only recently, and some were reportedly up for promotion before receiving layoff notices via surprise “time-sensitive” Teams meeting invites.“This was a difficult decision, and we made it with care, thoughtfulness and a deep awareness of its impact on our people,” PwC said in a statement, citing historically low attrition rates as a contributing factor.The firm also plans to cut back on campus hiring but will honour offers already extended to interns. Other Big Four firms, including Deloitte and KPMG, have recently implemented similar cuts in response to slowing demand and low staff turnover.Cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike is laying off 5% of its global workforce, around 500 roles, as part of a strategic realignment despite reporting a 25% year-on-year revenue increase to $1.06 billion in the last quarter.“While we will continue to prudently hire, primarily in customer-facing and product engineering roles, we are reducing roles in some areas of the business,” CEO George Kurtz said in a note to employees.The company is targeting $10 billion in annual recurring revenue and plans to continue hiring in key strategic areas through 2026. It expects to incur up to $53 million in restructuring-related charges.British luxury fashion house Burberry is laying off 1,700 employees, almost 20% of its global workforce, in a sweeping cost-saving move under new CEO Joshua Schulman. Most cuts will affect office-based staff, and the Castleford trench coat factory will lose its night shift due to overproduction.“Our brand metrics have all shown a significant improvement in the second half versus the first half,” Schulman told reporters, expressing cautious optimism.The company reported better-than-expected profits of £26 million for FY25, though sales dipped 6% in the final quarter amid a sluggish luxury market. Schulman, Burberry’s fourth CEO in a decade, is pivoting the brand back to its heritage products while trimming underperforming divisions and refocusing on high-margin leather goods.","Microsoft is laying off approximately 3% of its global workforce, affecting over 6,000 employees across departments and regions.

SAN FRANCISCO: A mix of democratic and republican state attorneys on Friday called on Congress to reject a moratorium on regulating artificial intelligence included in US President Donald Trump's tax bill.Top attorneys representing 40 states signed a letter urging leaders in Congress to reject the AI regulation moratorium language added to the budget reconciliation bill ""The impact of such a broad moratorium would be sweeping and wholly destructive of reasonable state efforts to prevent known harms associated with AI,"" the letter states.""This bill will affect hundreds of existing and pending state laws passed and considered by both republican and democratic state legislatures.""The amendment added by the house energy and commerce committee to the budget reconciliation bill imposes a 10-year prohibition on states from enforcing any state regulation addressing AI or ""automated decision-making systems,"" according to the state attorneys.""The amendment added to the reconciliation bill abdicates federal leadership and mandates that all states abandon their leadership in this area as well,"" the state attorneys general wrote.""This bill does not propose any regulatory scheme to replace or supplement the laws enacted or currently under consideration by the states, leaving Americans entirely unprotected from the potential harms of AI.""The letter notes that states have put in place laws designed to protect against AI-generated porn, deepfakes intended to mislead voters, and spam calls or text messages.Some state laws have also been crafted to prevent biases in AI models.""These laws and their regulations have been developed over years through careful consideration and extensive stakeholder input from consumers, industry, and advocates,"" the letter read. Republican fiscal hawks on Friday sunk a key vote on advancing the mega-bill that is the centerpiece of Trump's domestic agenda, in a significant setback for the US president's tax and spending policies.Trump is pushing to usher into law his so-called ""One Big, Beautiful Bill"" pairing an extension of his first-term tax cuts with savings that will see millions of the poorest Americans lose their health care coverage.But a congressional republican party rife with divisions and competition within its rank-and-file has complicated the process, raising serious doubts that the sprawling package can pass a vote of the full House of Representatives next week.The budget committee's no vote is not the final word on the package, which will be reworked and sent back to the panel for more debate starting 10 pm on Sunday (0200 GMT Monday) and a fresh vote.",Top attorneys representing 40 states signed a letter urging leaders in Congress to reject the AI regulation moratorium language.

Moody’s strips US of last triple-A credit rating over soaring debt: What it means for Trump,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/moodys-strips-us-of-last-triple-a-credit-rating-over-soaring-debt-what-it-means-for-trump/articleshow/121225901.cms,"Moody's Investors Service

The United States lost its final top-tier credit rating on Friday as Moody’s Investors Service downgraded the country’s long-held Aaa rating to Aa1, citing ballooning government debt and persistent deficits.The move undermines President Donald Trump's economic narrative just as his flagship spending bill faces setbacks in Congress.The downgrade coincided with the failure of Trump’s proposed multi-trillion dollar tax and spending legislation to pass a key vote, stalled by Republican fiscal conservatives.Moody’s decision follows similar downgrades by S&P in 2011 and Fitch in 2023, leaving the United States without a single triple-A rating from the major credit rating agencies.Explaining its rationale, Moody’s said the shift was due to “the increase over more than a decade in government debt and interest payment ratios to levels that are significantly higher than similarly rated sovereigns.”The agency projected federal deficits will rise to nearly 9% of GDP by 2035—up from 6.4% in 2023—driven largely by surging interest costs, entitlement spending, and limited revenue growth. As a consequence, US federal debt is expected to reach 134% of GDP by 2035, up from 98% last year.In response, the White House defended its fiscal record, and campaign communications director Steven Cheung lashed out at Moody’s Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi. “Nobody takes his 'analysis' seriously. He has been proven wrong time and time again,” Cheung posted on X.Moody’s noted the downgrade reflected Washington’s repeated inability to address structural fiscal challenges. “Successive US administrations and Congress have failed to agree on measures to reverse the trend of large annual fiscal deficits and growing interest costs,” the agency said, adding, “We do not believe that material multi-year reductions in mandatory spending and deficits will result from current fiscal proposals under consideration. ”While Moody’s outlook was revised from “negative” to “stable,” it warned the nation’s fiscal standing is weakening “relative to its own past and compared to other highly-rated sovereigns.”Congressman French Hill, chair of the house financial services committee, called the downgrade “a strong reminder that our nation's fiscal house is not in order,” pledging that republicans would work to “restore fiscal stability, address the structural drivers of our debt, and foster a pro-growth economic environment.”The timing of the downgrade is politically charged. Trump’s proposed “big, beautiful” spending bill which includes a $5 trillion extension of his 2017 tax cuts and controversial reductions to Medicaid is a cornerstone of his campaign messaging on economic stewardship.Despite the downgrade, Moody’s acknowledged US economic strengths, saying the country “retains exceptional credit strengths such as the size, resilience and dynamism of its economy and the role of the US dollar as global reserve currency.”",Moody's Investors Service downgraded the country’s long-held Aaa rating to Aa1.

US consumer sentiment falls for fifth month driven by inflation fears,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-consumer-sentiment-falls-for-fifth-month-amid-inflation-fears/articleshow/121217699.cms,"AI-generated image

Consumer sentiment in the United States fell for the fifth straight month in May, driven by growing concerns over inflation linked to President Donald Trump 's trade policies.According to preliminary data from the University of Michigan , the consumer sentiment index dropped by 2.7 per cent to 50.8- its lowest level since June 2022 and nearly 30 per cent below its January reading. The decline contradicts economists’ expectations of stabilization.The drop reflects rising anxiety over inflation, fueled by Trump’s aggressive tariff strategy. Although recent trade talks led to a reduction in US tariffs on Chinese goods, from 145 per cent to 30 per cent, current rates remain historically high. In return, China agreed to lower duties on US exports from 125 per cent to 10 per cent.People became more concerned about the escalating cost of living as inflation expectations surge. The Michigan survey found that consumers anticipate inflation to hit 7.3 per cent over the next year, the highest since 1981, up from 6.5 per cent last month. The five-year inflation outlook rose to 4.6 per cent- its highest since 1991.The Michigan survey, conducted from April 22 to May 13, only partially reflected the impact of the US-China tariff reductions announced on May 11.Meanwhile actual inflation fell to 2.3 per cent last month, a four-year low, thus, the Federal Reserve officials remain cautious. Persistent inflation expectations may delay any interest rate cuts, as they risk becoming self-fulfilling through wage demands and price hikes.Fed Chair Jerome Powell had previously called these consumer projections an “outlier,” but their steady climb may influence monetary policy decisions.","The consumer sentiment index dropped by 2.7 per cent to 50.8- its lowest level since June 2022.

Novo Nordisk CEO to step down amid market challenges and stock plunge,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/novo-nordisk-ceo-to-step-down-amid-market-challenges-and-stock-plunge/articleshow/121214675.cms,"Novo Nordisk outgoing CEO Lars Fruergaard Jorgensen (Image credit: LinkedIn)

Danish pharmaceutical giant Novo Nordisk , maker of popular weight-loss drug Ozempic , announced on Friday that CEO Lars Fruergaard Jorgensen will step down, citing ongoing ""market challenges"" and a significant drop in the company’s share value.The board and Jorgensen reached a mutual decision to initiate a leadership transition. He will remain in his role temporarily to ""support a smooth transition to new leadership"", according to the company.“The changes are, however, made in light of the recent market challenges Novo Nordisk has been facing, and the development of the company’s share price since mid-2024,” the company said in a statement. The board and Jorgensen “have jointly concluded that initiating a CEO succession is in the best interest of the company and its shareholders,"" it added.The decision comes as Novo Nordisk grapples with a sharp decline in its stock price- down more than 50 per cent since June 2024. This was after the stock value had experienced a dramatic surge following the launch of both Wegovy and the diabetes medication Ozempic, with both products containing semaglutide as their primary active component.Then, sShares fell a further three per cent on the Copenhagen exchange following Friday's CEO exit announcement.The company recently downgraded its annual sales growth projection, adjusting the forecast from 16-24 per cent to 13-21 per cent. The revision is attributed to rising competition, particularly from compounded versions of its GLP-1 drugs Wegovy and Ozempic, produced in American pharmacies during a recent supply shortage.However, the US regulators, even though had declared the shortage over in February and ordered an end to compounding, the impact continues to be felt. Novo Nordisk stated it is “actively focused on preventing unlawful and unsafe compounding.”The firm also faces increasing pressure from US rival Eli Lilly , whose weight-loss injection Zepbound is gaining traction in the same market. A research paper published in the New England Journal of Medicine on Sunday revealed that individuals achieved greater weight reduction whilst using Eli Lilly's rival medication Zepbound.Additionally, the announcement of successful clinical trials for Eli Lilly's diabetes and obesity medication orforglipron caused Novo Nordisk's share prices to decline significantly last month.Diabetes affects more than 10 percent of people globally, and treatments for this condition remain central to Novo Nordisk's pharmaceutical operations. The International Diabetes Federation projects a 46 percent rise in adult diabetes cases by 2045.Additionally, the World Obesity Federation anticipates that by 2035, obesity and overweight conditions will affect over 50 percent of global population, potentially resulting in annual economic consequences exceeding $4 trillion.","Lars Fruergaard Jorgensen will step down as CEO of Danish pharmaceutical giant Novo Nordisk.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Space sector start-up Sisir Radar to develop SAR on L/P band SAR,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/space-sector-start-up-sisir-radar-to-develop-sar-on-l/p-band-sar/articleshow/104558111.cms,"CHENNAI: Space sector startup, Sisir Radar Private Ltd has hit success at the prestigious iDEX DefSpace Challenge with its projects for development of “L/P band Continuous Wave SAR (synthetic aperture radar) payload for LEO Small Satellites” and “Unfurlable, Electronically Steering Antenna for L/P band SAR payload” for Indian Air Force (IAF), said a top company official.The company is promoted by former Director at the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) Tapan Misra and the brains behind the Indian space agency’s RISAT series of SAR satellites as well as the Dual Frequency SAR on the Chandrayaan 2 orbiter that is currently circling the moon.""A grant of Rs 3 crore is also there for development of the products,"" Misra told IANS.Synthetic Aperture Radar or SAR is a special kind of imaging radar technology that can provide extremely accurate high resolution imagery of the terrain through clouds, smoke and dust even in pitch dark conditions. SAR imagery provides much higher resolution than other forms of remote sensing technology such as hyperspectral and multispectral. SAR is a critical technology for strategic reconnaissance and planning as well as for disaster management.According to Misra, winning the challenge in just over a year of floating the company is a major booster.He said L and P band SAR have an advantage over other frequencies (like X band) when it comes to penetration capabilities through rain, clouds, foliage and vegetation in a tropical country like India, and underground penetration capabilities in dry terrain.Continuing further, he said the L band SAR will provide 1 metre resolution, spotlight resolution in Stripmap mode. The current industry standard is 5-10 metre in L band. Misra said both the L and P band will operate simultaneously from a satellite borne SAR. Recently, Sisir Radar successfully developed and tested the world’s highest resolution L-Band SAR fitted on a drone. With 0.2 metre resolution, this is by far the highest L band SAR in the world, he said.","Space sector startup, Sisir Radar Private Ltd has hit success at the prestigious iDEX DefSpace Challenge.

Testify: Sam Bankman-Fried acknowledges 'mistakes' but testifies he did not defraud anyone,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/cryptocurrency/sam-bankman-fried-acknowledges-mistakes-but-testifies-he-did-not-defraud-anyone/articleshow/104761929.cms,"<p>Sam Bankman-Fried (File Photo- Reuters)<br></p>

NEW YORK: Sam Bankman-Fried , testifying in his own defense at his fraud trial on Friday, acknowledged that a ""lot of people got hurt"" when the FTX cryptocurrency exchange he founded collapsed, but said he did not defraud anyone or take customer funds.Shortly after taking the witness stand in Manhattan federal court, Bankman-Fried said he made ""a number of small mistakes and a number of larger mistakes"" while running the now-bankrupt exchange. The biggest mistake, he said, was not implementing a dedicated risk management team.""We thought that we might be able to build the best product on the market,"" Bankman-Fried said. ""It turned out basically the opposite of that. A lot of people got hurt - customers, employees - and the company ended up in bankruptcy.""Prosecutors accuse Bankman-Fried of using FTX customer funds to prop up his crypto-focused hedge fund, Alameda Research, make speculative venture investments and donate more than $100 million to US political campaigns. He also faces charges of scheming to cheat Alameda's lenders and FTX investors.He has pleaded not guiltyBankman-Fried's trial, which began on October 3, is drawing to a close nearly a year after FTX collapsed amid a wave of customer withdrawals. The company declared bankruptcy in November 2022 and Bankman-Fried was indicted the following month.His testimony marked the first time the dozen jurors and five alternates have heard directly from the 31-year-old former billionaire after 12 trial days.Bankman-Fried, who was jailed in August after US District Judge Lewis Kaplan found he likely tampered with witnesses, wore a suit and spoke with two water bottles placed in front of him on the witness stand. The former mogul once known for wearing shorts and T-shirts and sporting an unkempt mop of curly locks cut his hair before his trial began.Responding to questions posed by his defense lawyer Mark Cohen, Bankman-Fried spoke in calm, measured tones during the first portion of his testimony as he recounted founding Alameda in 2017, shortly after graduating from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, despite knowing little about crypto.But Bankman-Fried - who had studied physics and worked as a quantitative trader at Jane Street - said he saw opportunities for ""arbitrage"" in the market for digital assets. He said Alameda's first office was in a small Airbnb in Berkeley, California, before he later moved the firm to Hong Kong.""We wanted to be under the radar at that point in time,"" he said on the stand, adding he named the hedge fund after the California county where it was founded in part so competitors would not discover what they were doing.Jurors have heard from three of his closest confidantes at FTX and Alameda, all of whom have pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors. They testified earlier this month that they committed financial crimes at Bankman-Fried's behest.For criminal defendants, taking the stand is a risky proposition because it opens them up to potentially probing cross-examination by prosecutors.But given Bankman-Fried's penchant for risk, legal experts say he likely viewed taking the stand as his best shot to counter the allegations made by members of his inner circle, which were backed up by spreadsheets the three said demonstrated how customer funds were stolen and text messages in which they discussed FTX's shortfall of funds with Bankman-Fried.","Sam Bankman-Fried says he made ""a number of small mistakes and a number of larger mistakes"" while running the now-bankrupt exchange.

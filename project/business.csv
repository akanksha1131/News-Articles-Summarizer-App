Piyush Goyal Sends Strong Reply To Donald Trump, Says India Wants Fair But Balanced Trade Agreement

India-US trade deal: 3-point strategy India should adopt

End oil imports from sanctioned Russian firms. Trump has acknowledged that India has largely done this, so Step 1 is complete, says GTRI.

Secure tariff rollback before trade talks. With Russian oil imports curtailed, India should press Washington to withdraw the 25% “Russian oil” tariff. This would reduce the overall US duty burden on Indian goods from 50% to 25%, boosting competitiveness in sectors like textiles, gems and jewellery, and pharmaceuticals without rushing into a full trade deal, it says.

Resume trade negotiations after tariffs come down to 25%. Once duties are rolled back, India should restart talks for a balanced trade agreement, aiming for parity with partners like the EU and targeting average industrial tariffs of about 15%, it adds.

India-US trade deal: What’s the status?





With US President Donald Trump hinting at a trade deal soon, Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI) founder Ajay Srivastava says that India should push for rollback of 25% tariffs on account of Russian crude oil. Srivastava is of the view that before finalizing the trade deal, India should insist on America dropping the penal tariff, especially as Trump has himself claimed that India has substantially dropped its Russian crude oil trade.President Trump indicated on Monday that he plans to lower tariffs on India in the future, acknowledging that his trade policies had strained bilateral relations whilst again claiming that India has significantly reduced Russian oil imports.During the Oval Office ceremony for Sergio Gor's swearing-in as the new ambassador to India, Trump remarked, ""So right now, they don't love me, but they'll love us again."" When discussing potential trade agreements, he simply stated, ""I think we're pretty close to doing a deal that's good for everybody,"" without providing specific details about timing or remaining obstacles.GTRI proposes a 3-point approach for India: finalise withdrawal from sanctioned Russian oil trading, get the US to reverse 25% Russian oil duty to enhance market access, and subsequently engage in balanced trade discussions with the US as equals.GTRI also points out that India could potentially benefit from awaiting the US Supreme Court's verdict on Trump tariffs. Should previous rulings be upheld and the tariffs invalidated, India would be better positioned to negotiate a fair and progressive trade agreement with the US, without the constraints of unilateral duties.The US Supreme Court has commenced hearings on a significant case regarding presidential authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose such tariffs. Several justices expressed doubts about whether the legislation permits such extensive authority. A ruling against Trump would render these tariffs unlawful and require their withdrawal, potentially influencing global trade patterns and directly impacting US-India trade discussions.The trade negotiations between India and the US appear to be reaching completion, with additional discussions becoming less likely. The Indian government maintains its stance on achieving a fair outcome.At an event, Commerce & Industry Minister Piyush Goyal said, ""We are working for a good trade deal in the interest of India. We want a fair, equitable, and balanced trade deal with the US. If that happens, it could happen any day, tomorrow, next month, or next year. But as a government, we are preparing for everything.""A high-ranking official told TOI that discussions with the US have largely concluded, with no additional rounds anticipated.The official noted, ""They (the US) have to get back to us. It's the most comprehensive, WTO-compliant treaty compared to any other nation. We negotiated very cautiously, keeping in mind the sensitivities of key sectors. There is no deadline.""Following five rounds of official-level discussions, with involvement from Goyal and External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar with their American counterparts, progress appears promising.",US President Trump indicated on Monday that he plans to lower tariffs on India in the future.

Benchmark indices ended their two-week losing streak and are trading firmly higher this week, in line with gains across global markets. Investor confidence has strengthened as the US government shutdown came to an end, with growing expectations of early Federal Reserve rate cuts amid signs of a slowdown in the U.S. job market. Additionally, India’s CPI data came in at a record low, while exit polls from the Bihar election indicating a majority for the ruling NDA further lifted sentiment. Hopes of an India–US trade deal also added to the positive momentum.Market trajectory in the upcoming week is likely to be driven by the outcome of the Bihar election, scheduled for release tomorrow, and key developments surrounding the anticipated India–U.S. trade agreement. Both factors are expected to act as major sentiment catalysts and could trigger heightened volatility across broader indices.Going forward, the broader market structure remains constructive, and we maintain a bullish bias.We recommend utilizing any corrective declines as accumulation opportunities for the next leg of the uptrend, with upside targets placed at 26,100, followed by a potential retest of the all-time high near the 26,277 zone in the coming weeks.In line with expectations, buying demand during last week emerged from the support area of 25,500-25,300. We expect the index to hold above the same being the confluence of the following technical observations.Among the oscillators, the daily 14 periods RSI has recently generated a buy signal thus supports the overall positive bias in the index.Bank Nifty continues to consolidate in the range of 57200-58600 for the fourth week in a row and is currently placed around the upper band of the range.Going ahead we expect the index to break above the upper band of the consolidation range and head towards 59,000 and 59,800 levels in the coming weeks being the measuring implication of the last 4 weeks range.On the downside, the lower band of the consolidation range at 57,300–57,100, which coincides with the recent breakout zone and the 20-day EMA, is likely to act as a strong support area.Among the oscillators, the daily 14 periods RSI has recently generated a buy signal thus supports the overall positive bias in the index.CG Power is highly optimistic, driven by structural industry tailwinds (T&D capex, railway modernization, Make in India), aggressive capacity expansion, and a strategic push into semiconductors and services. Company benefits from a diverse customer base, a strong manufacturing foundation, continuous R&D and product development, and rising export opportunities.The company faces challenges from the cyclical nature of the power business, increasing transformer supply in India, and its lack of prior experience in semiconductors. We have valued the company using the P/E valuation method, applying a 57x multiple on FY28E earnings, arriving at a target price of Rs 798.The stock is forming base around the 80% retracement of the previous major up move of October 2025 and has witnessed a shallow retracement of its previous up move signaling overall positive bias in the stock.We expect the stock to resume up move and head towards 7980 levels in the coming month being the confluence of the previous major high and key retracement of the current decline.Among the oscillators the daily stochastic has approached oversold territory and is seen rebounding from the same thus signals pullback in the coming months.","According to Bajaj Broking Research, the top stock picks for November 14, 2025 are CG Power and Industrial Solutions, and Apollo Hospitals Enterprise.

Iveco acquisition adds global potential



(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market, other asset classes or personal finance management tips given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India.)





Shares of Tata Motors Commercial Vehicles Ltd (TMLCV), the newly demerged commercial vehicle arm of Tata Motors , made a robust debut on Wednesday, listing at a premium of over 26%–28% to its implied value..The stock opened at Rs 335 on the NSE, up 28.5% from the implied value of Rs 260.75 and at Rs 330.25 on the BSE, a 26.6% gain.Post listing, it rose further to Rs 345 on the NSE, reflecting solid investor enthusiasm for India’s largest truck and bus maker.Analysts cited optimism about India’s commercial vehicle upcycle and infrastructure growth as key drivers.Jahol Prajapati, research analyst at Samco Securities, was quoted by ET as saying that the demerger “separates the fast-growing passenger vehicle and EV business from the more stable, cash-generating CV business, allowing investors to value each on its own strength.”He noted that shareholders will get one share of TMLCV for every Tata Motors share held, with no dilution of ownership.According to ET, TMLCV reported FY25 revenue of Rs 75,055 crore and EBITDA of Rs 8,856 crore, implying an 11.8% margin.Prajapati added, “Using Ashok Leyland’s EV/EBITDA multiple of 12.9x, the fair value for TMLCV comes around Rs 1.14 lakh crore, or roughly Rs 310–Rs 320 per share.” He said the listing “removes the conglomerate discount and gives investors a focused bet on India’s commercial vehicle upcycle.”Brokerages remain broadly positive but advise caution on near-term volatility.Ambit Institutional Equities called the demerger “a separation of value and growth propositions,” stating that “the CV business is better positioned to capitalise on the demerger” and could see “immediate value unlocking.”SBI Securities values the CV arm between Rs 320 and Rs 470 per share.Harshal Dasani, business head at INVasset PMS, said, “For investors, this listing presents a dual-edged opportunity — a sharp, India-centric commercial vehicle play aligned with freight and infrastructure growth, but also early-stage listing risks and cyclicality in margins.”He recommended that long-term investors “hold the stock in a medium-term portfolio with a three-to-five-year horizon.”According to ET, analysts see Tata Motors’ pending acquisition of Italy’s Iveco Group NV’s commercial vehicle operations for €3.8 billion as a transformative step.Dasani said, “The Iveco acquisition adds technological heft but will take time to reflect in earnings,” calling it a “long-term strategic catalyst” that could make TMLCV a global contender in medium and heavy commercial vehicles.In the near term, analysts expect some volatility as funds rebalance post-demerger but believe that GDP-linked demand recovery, infrastructure expansion, and emission-led upgrades will gradually support the stock’s trajectory.","Shares of Tata Motors Commercial Vehicles Ltd (TMLCV) made a robust debut on Wednesday, listing at a premium of over 26%–28% to its implied value.

Gold price prediction today:

Gold prices are expected to face upside resistance, and buying on dips may be a favourable strategy, says Maneesh Sharma, AVP - Commodities & Currencies, Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers.

He shares his views and recommendations for gold and silver investors:

Gold Price Outlook

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market, other asset classes or personal finance management tips given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)





Gold price ended last week almost flat showing consolidated moves while positive developments over US Shutdown reopening over the weekend revived prospects for rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve (Fed) in December shifting focus back to deteriorating US Fiscal outlook. US private jobs data released last week indicated a weak labour market, further supporting the US rate cut prospects. US Challenger job data also indicated a spike in job cuts, suggesting a possible cooling in US labour market conditions.CME Fed funds tool showed rate cut possibility for December 10 -11 meeting have risen to above 90 % now from around 66 % yesterday. Worries about the potential economic fallout from the longest-ever US government shutdown turned out to be a key factor that continued to underpin demand for the safe-haven commodity as the yellow metal rose to three week highs in the current week.Inflation concerns also persisted as President Donald Trump floated the idea of sending American rebate checks of at least $ 2000 a person (excluding high income people) for the tariffs that his administration has collected which provided additional support to yellow metal.In other news, China central bank continued to buy gold for 12th Consecutive month as data showed China's official gold reserves stood at 74.09 MOz at the end of October up 74.06 Moz from a month earlier, which meant PBoC bought nearly one tonne which continued to boost sentiments in Gold.Meanwhile spot silver rose more than 4 % to above $50 per oz, reaching its highest since October 21. The US, which added copper, and silver to its critical minerals list, also provided structural support for precious and industrial metals. However, the supply shortage which persisted in October has likely eased now indicating an unlikely scenario for new highs in spot, but prices could still find support from uncertain economic conditions in the US which could keep safe haven flows intact in white metal.In the near term, gold is expected to test its resistance zone around $ 4190 – 4210 per oz (CMP $ 4135/Oz) while buying on dips could remain a favourable strategy for the metal. Support for the yellow metal could persist in the range of $ 4110 – 4075 per oz in near term. On MCX futures (CMP 124,850/10 gm) prices are expected to witness strong supports in the range of 1,23,800 – 1,22,900 per 10 gm levels in near term as resistance on higher side to remain at around Rs, 1,26,500 – 1,27,900 /10 gm levels for the week.Looking ahead for the week, volatility in prices could also occur at higher levels driven by fluctuations in the dollar index and global financial market as traders could closely monitor the US October Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation data later on Thursday. The headline CPI is expected to show an increase of 0.2% MoM in October, while the core CPI is projected to show a rise of 0.3% MoM during the same period. The US Retail Sales will be in the spotlight on Friday.Silver could also trade with a positive bias as a rise towards $ 52. 20 - 52.50 per oz (CMP $ 51.10/Oz) in spot cannot be ruled out in near term. Strong support could persist in the range of $ 50.20 – 49.50 /Oz levels. On MCX futures contract (CMP Rs. 1,55,500/Kg.) This could translate to a support level of Rs. 1,52,500–1,50,800 / Kg & resistance at Rs 1,58,000 - 1,59,500/Kg levels for the week.","Gold prices are expected to face upside resistance, and buying on dips may be a favourable strategy, says Maneesh Sharma, AVP - Commodities & Currencies, Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers.

Groww made a strong debut on Dalal Street on Wednesday, with shares listing on both the BSE and NSE at a premium over the issue price.Shares of Billionbrains Garage Ventures Ltd (Groww) listed at Rs 114 apiece on the BSE, marking a 14% premium over the IPO price of Rs 100. On the NSE, the stock debuted at Rs 112 per share, up 12% from the issue price.The Bengaluru-based fintech platform’s Rs 6,632 crore IPO was among the most anticipated issues of 2025, and the positive listing reflects steady investor confidence in India’s growing digital investing ecosystem.The grey market premium (GMP) for Groww IPO stood at Rs 3 per share as of Tuesday evening, down from Rs 16 on the day the issue opened, as reported by ET. The muted GMP had suggested a likely listing premium of around 4–5%, but the stock exceeded those expectations by opening 12–14% higher on debut.Analysts said the stronger-than-expected listing signals investor optimism toward fintech growth despite regulatory headwinds.As per ET, Prashanth Tapse, Sr VP Research at Mehta Equities, said, “At listing, Groww’s implied valuation appears justifiable, backed by rapid customer growth (over 10 crore users), strong brand recall in retail investing, rising market share in F&O and mutual fund distribution, and a scalable digital business model with low incremental cost.”Analysts tracking the stock remain cautiously optimistic. Raj Gaikar, Research Analyst at Samco Securities, was quoted by ET as saying, “For investors who have received allotments, we recommend holding the stock for at least 2–3 years, as we anticipate further upside over that period, given Groww’s profitability and strong revenue growth.”He noted that Groww’s valuation at 33x FY25 earnings is slightly higher than peers such as Motilal Oswal Financial Services (29x) and Angel One (31x).Prashanth Tapse of Mehta Equities also advised investors to stay invested, saying, “Those allotted shares should hold through listing, while new investors can consider entering post-listing if valuations remain reasonable and business momentum continues — particularly on any post-listing dips as a potential entry point.”Founded in 2017, Groww operates a direct-to-customer digital investment platform that allows users to invest in mutual funds, stocks, F&O, ETFs, IPOs, digital gold, and U.S. stocks. The app is particularly popular among mutual fund investors.The company also provides margin trading, algorithmic trading, credit facilities, and new fund offers (NFOs) to enhance user engagement.Its customer base includes both first-time investors and affluent clients, contributing to a healthy mix of revenue streams.The IPO comprised a fresh issue of Rs 1,060 crore and an offer for sale (OFS) of Rs 5,572 crore by existing shareholders. Proceeds from the fresh issue will fund cloud infrastructure, marketing, and capital infusion into subsidiaries such as Groww Creditserv Tech and Groww Invest Tech.Kotak Mahindra Capital, JP Morgan India, Citigroup Global Markets India, Axis Capital, and Motilal Oswal Investment Advisors were the Book Running Lead Managers, while MUFG Intime India Private Limited served as the Registrar.In FY25, Groww reported operating revenue of Rs 3,901 crore, up 49% YoY, and a PAT of Rs 1,824 crore, marking a strong turnaround from previous losses.Its EBITDA margin rose to 60.8%, supported by organic user growth and reduced marketing costs.The company’s AARPU (average revenue per user) improved to Rs 3,339 in FY25 from Rs 2,541 in FY23, showing higher profitability from its affluent investor base.Despite solid growth, analysts remain cautious due to SEBI’s tightening oversight of the F&O segment, a key revenue driver for Groww and other discount brokers.Potential restrictions on weekly options and stricter margin norms could impact trading volumes and revenue growth.At the upper price band, Groww’s valuation of 33.8x FY25 P/E is higher than peers like Angel One (19x) and Anand Rathi Wealth (25x), but analysts believe the premium is justified given Groww’s technology edge, brand visibility and expanding retail franchise.Groww is the first new-age wealthtech firm to list on the Indian bourses, marking a major milestone for the fintech ecosystem.While listing gains may be moderate, the company’s long-term prospects hinge on diversifying beyond F&O and scaling its wealth management offerings amid increasing regulatory scrutiny.","Groww made a strong debut on Dalal Street on Wednesday, with shares listing on both the BSE and NSE at a premium over the issue price.

US government shutdown: Supreme Court extends block on Snap payments; hopes rise for potential end to standoff,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-govt-shutdown-supreme-court-extends-block-on-snap-payments-hopes-rise-for-potential-end-to-standoff/articleshow/125263032.cms,"1000+ Flights Cancelled As Shutdown Severely Impacts American Aviation Sector

Snap benefits









The US Supreme Court had, once again, refused to order the Trump administration to provide full funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap). Instead it has chosen to allow congress additional time to resolve the matter through a possible agreement tied to ending the government shutdown.In an order issued on Tuesday (local time), the justices extended a temporary halt on a lower court ruling that had required the administration to release full food benefit payments. The stay remains active until November 13, effectively putting the funding issue on hold without the court examining the legal arguments of either side.The dispute reached the Supreme Court after Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, who handles emergency requests from the 1st US Circuit Court of Appeals’ jurisdiction, paused a district court-imposed deadline for the payments while the appeals judges reviewed the case.Jackson, one of the court’s liberal justices, approved an emergency request from the administration, even though the matter involves a programme strongly supported by Democrats. In the latest order, Jackson stated she disagreed with the court’s decision to keep the pause in place on full Snap funding.Meanwhile, lawmakers are racing to reach a broader deal. The House of Representatives is expected to vote on Wednesday on a plan to reopen the government through January 30.That proposal includes full-year funding for several federal agencies and services, covering food assistance and benefits for veterans.The department of justice has warned the Supreme Court that judicial intervention risks complicating shutdown negotiations.Government lawyers, according to USA Today, have argued that the lower courts introduced a “massively inappropriate new variable” and disrupted the operation of Snap. Solicitor General John Sauer wrote, ""Congress appears to be on the brink of breaking the deadlock, though that outcome is unsure.”“The district court’s unlawful orders risk upsetting that compromise and throwing into doubt how innumerable critical federal programs will be funded,"" Sauer was further quoted by the agency.The legal fight began when the US district judge John McConnell in Rhode Island ordered the administration to use contingency Snap funds and other available money to ensure full November payments reached states by November 7. The appeals court sided with McConnell, ruling that the danger of leaving tens of millions of Americans without adequate food support outweighed the administration’s objections to using alternative funds.The groups opposing the Trump administration have argued that Snap recipients had “now gone ten days without the help they need to afford food,” warning that millions of Americans, including children, were already going hungry.Almost 42 million people across the country rely on food stamps, which are distributed in phases throughout the month. According to Code for America, an organisation that helps governments improve access to public benefit programmes, about 27 million of them should have received their payments by Monday.US households, according to CNN, on an average get roughly $350 a month to purchase food, but for many families, that money runs out quickly.","The US Supreme Court extended a temporary halt on a lower court ruling that had required the administration to release full food benefit payments.

BENGALURU: Bhaskar Bhat, a one-company man, began his career at the Tatas as a member of its watch project in the early 1980s.He eventually secured a coveted seat at the highest table in the group when he was appointed to the board of the Sir Dorabji Tata Trust 42 years later. During that period, he, along with his mentor and the founding managing director of Titan, Xerxes Desai, revolutionised the staid watch industry by launching quartz watches and dethroning HMT as India's watch-keeper.Later, the bold decision to enter the jewellery business paid off with staggering dividends for the company. Under Bhat, Titan became the Tata group 's second most valuable company by market capitalisation after TCS.During Bhat's 17 years at the helm of Titan, the company rewrote the retail-consumer markets in the country with its top-notch marketing and merchandising, transforming Titan into one of India's most admired consumer brands. Bhat, whose roles spanned across sales and marketing, human resources, international business, and general management, took over as MD of Titan in 2002 from Desai.Titan's revenue then stood at less than Rs 1,000 crore. By the time he retired in 2019, the company grew nearly 20-fold to Rs 20,000 crore.""After Xerxes Desai, it was a big shoe to fill. But Bhat brought his own leadership style and was comfortable in his own skin,"" said Jacob Kurian, former Titan COO, who revitalised the then ailing jewellery business, Tanishq, by shifting emphasis from its 18-carat product range to what the Indian market wanted, 22-carat jewellery.As Bhat rose through the ranks, his credibility within Bombay House grew steadily, earning him strong trust and confidence across the Tata Group. He built consensus around every strategic move and never let his own views overshadow those of others. ""Desai had a disdain for metrics or the stock market,"" Kurian said.Even before he became MD, Bhat was among the earliest business leaders to engage with legendary investor Rakesh Jhunjhunwala. In one memorable early meeting, Jhunjhunwala offered Bhat insights into how the market perceived Titan — and how success should truly be measured, Kurian recalled. Bhat formed what he called a Mission Impossible team to revive Titan's watch business, challenging them to do new things, recalled B.G. Dwarakanath, former SVP and COO of Titan's Precision Engineering division.Bhat's humility often revealed itself in the smallest gestures. His review meetings at Hosur often ended with a simple plantain-leaf meal at Anjaneya Mess — a modest vegetarian eatery of barely 500 sft. After a hearty wedding meal, he would walk into the kitchen to personally thank the cooks for their effort and compliment the food, recounted Dwarakanath. At airports, he was known to hand chocolates to security staff after frisking — a quiet nod of appreciation for their service.Once, on his way to a business review committee meeting of another company, the car arranged for him broke down. Without hesitation, he called his driver, who arrived on a scooter — and Bhaskar simply hopped on as a pillion and rode to the airport. That simplicity and warmth stayed with him even as he became Chairman of Vistara . It is this blend of grounded-ness, empathy, and strategic clarity that defined Bhaskar Bhat's leadership — qualities that helped shape Titan into a powerhouse and made him one of the most respected leaders in the Tata Group. ""He was Titan's chief empathy officer,"" said Dwarakanath.","Bhaskar Bhat is the Chairman of Vistara. He was the Managing Director of Titan for 17 years. Titan is the second most valuable company in the Tata Group after TCS. During his time at Titan, the company grew 20-fold to Rs 20,000 crore.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125314060,imgsize-60606,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/untitled-design-5.jpg"

M&M makes life insurance foray with Canada’s Manulife,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/mm-makes-life-insurance-foray-with-canadas-manulife/articleshow/125313958.cms,"



MUMBAI: Mahindra & Mahindra has deepened its presence in India’s financial sector by partnering with Canada’s Manulife to enter the life insurance business through a new 50:50 joint venture. The two companies have signed an agreement to establish a life insurer in India, subject to regulatory approvals, with each holding an equal stake and a capital commitment capped at Rs 3,600 crore over ten years. Both firms plan to invest around Rs 1,250 crore each in the first five years.The venture will build on their existing collaboration in asset management launched in 2020. The new company, to be set up as a public limited entity, will provide life insurance and related services across India.It aims to expand coverage in rural and semi-urban areas while also catering to urban customers with savings and protection products. M&M will have the right to nominate two directors to the board, restrict changes to the company’s capital structure, and appoint key management personnel in line with the joint venture agreement.According to M&M group CEO and MD Anish Shah, the partnership fits into the group’s plan to build a broad-based financial services portfolio.He said the Mahindra brand’s distribution strength in smaller towns, combined with Manulife’s global expertise in underwriting and reinsurance, will help create a technology-led, customer-centric insurer. Manulife president and CEO Phil Witherington said India’s fast-growing insurance market presents “tremendous opportunity,” adding that the company’s alliance with Mahindra would leverage their complementary strengths in distribution and insurance capabilities.India’s life insurance market, with new business premiums exceeding US$20 billion, has grown at an annual rate of about 12% over the past five years. Despite this growth, the country still faces a wide protection gap and low insurance penetration, offering significant potential for expansion. The partnership seeks to tap this opportunity by combining Mahindra’s rural access and Manulife’s international experience to build scale in a market projected to become the world’s fourth-largest in the next decade.","The two companies have signed an agreement to establish a life insurer in India.

India market key to be a top global brand: Biscoff maker,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/india-market-key-to-be-a-top-global-brand-biscoff-maker/articleshow/125313927.cms,".





MUMBAI: Your next pack of Biscoff cookies will be made in India which also means you will be paying less for them. The Belgian brand from the house of Lotus Bakeries has started local production in India in partnership with Cadbury chocolates and Oreo cookies maker Mondelez as the family run Brussels listed company plans to ride on India’s growth potential to expand Biscoff’s global footprint.The Indian market, Jan Boone, CEO at the nearly 100-year-old Lotus Bakeries said, is key to Biscoff’s ambition to become the third largest global brand. Local production, Boone said, will make the brand more affordable for consumers.Mondelez India will manufacture Biscoff cookies in its Rajasthan plant (through their third party manufacturer) besides marketing and distributing them locally.“If we want to be number three in the world, if we want to be a global brand, India should be a part of it.We could not conquer India on our own, the distribution is complex,” Boone said in a media roundtable. Locally made Biscoff cookies will hit retail shelves and online channels across the country in 45 days.Boone expects India, a country with a large cohort of Gen Zs--Biscoff’s key target consumers to become the brand’s top 3-4 markets going ahead. With this partnership, that was announced last year, Lotus Bakeries which rivals Mondelez globally in the snacking space, has for the first time outsourced production of Biscoff to another firm.“Biscoff is loved by Gen Z. We have almost 1.8 billion views on TikTok and social media. In India, Gen Zs make up more than 25% of the population,” said Boone. The CEO did not reveal the terms of the deal with Mondelez but said it has a “long term perspective” and if things work out well, it will continue for good. For Lotus Bakeries that has a portfolio of snacking brands including Bear, Trek and Peter’s Yard, Biscoff accounts for more than half of its turnover which stood at 1.2 billion euros in 2024.Lotus Bakeries is betting on the taste and distinct caramelised flavour of Biscoff to set itself apart from competition in India. Besides, given the fact that Indians love to have a biscuit or cookie with their cup of chai and coffee, there’s scope for the brand to grow in the market and offer consumers a choice to premiumise their basket of cookies.“There’s an opportunity for us to premiumise the cookie market in India, offering a very premium cookie as a beverage accompaniment both for tea and coffee,” said Samir Jain, president-India at Mondelez International.The pricing has been kept affordable to enable wider accessibility. The low unit packs are priced at Rs 10, the mid pack at Rs 80 and the large packs will sell for Rs 110. Premium cookies make up only 3.5-4% of the broader local biscuits market, providing enough scope for Biscoff to grow and expand the segment, said Jain. T hrough Biscoff, Mondelez will compete with Parle, ITC and Britannia in the space.As part of the global deal between Mondelez International and Lotus Bakeries (focused on Biscoff brand), the two companies also plan to develop and market co-branded chocolate products in other countries alongside launching Biscoff ice creams in Europe.","Mondelez India will manufacture Biscoff cookies in its Rajasthan plant.

NEW DELHI: Government has withdrawn 14 quality control orders (QCOs) issued by the Bureau of Indian Standards, covering key chemicals, polymers, and fibre-based materials, amid concerns expressed by a section of industry.The list of products includes terephthalic acid, ethylene glycol, polyester yarns and fibres, and major plastics such as polypropylene, polyethylene, PVC, ABS, and polycarbonate, an official said. The changes will be effective as soon as an official notification is issued.The move, announced by the ministry of chemicals and fertilisers, aims to ensure raw material availability, ease import constraints, and lower input costs for downstream MSMEs in the packaging, textile, and moulding sectors, officials said.By removing mandatory BIS certification, govt has simplified compliance procedures, eliminated duplication of testing, and accelerated approvals for manufacturers and importers which will improve operational efficiency and competitiveness, they added.

US mortgage rates edge up again: 30-year rate climbs to 6.24% in a week from 6.22%; housing affordability remains a key concern,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-mortgage-rates-edge-up-again-30-year-rate-climbs-to-6-24-per-cent-in-a-week-from-6-22-housing-affordability-remains-a-key-concern/articleshow/125308834.cms,"Representa





The 30-year US mortgage rate rose slightly for the second consecutive week but stayed close to its lowest level of the year.Freddie Mac, quoted by AP, reported on Thursday that the long-term mortgage rate increased to 6.24 per cent from 6.22 per cent the previous week. A year earlier, the rate stood at 6.78 per cent. The rate reached 6.17 per cent a fortnight ago, marking its lowest point in over a year.The 15-year fixed-rate mortgage, often preferred by homeowners for refinancing, edged down to 5.49 per cent from 5.5 per cent last week, compared to 5.99 per cent during the same period last year.Mortgage rates are influenced by several factors, including Federal Reserve policy, and bond market expectations on inflation and the economy.These rates generally track the 10-year Treasury yield, a key benchmark for home loan pricing, which stood at 4.10 per cent by Thursday midday — a slight increase from the previous week.Higher mortgage rates continue to weigh on homebuyers’ purchasing power. Rates have remained above 6 per cent since September 2022, when they began climbing from historic lows, triggering a prolonged housing market slowdown.Sales of existing US homes hit their lowest level in nearly 30 years in 2022.Although activity remained muted this year, sales rose in September to their highest since February as borrowing costs eased.“Lower rates could finally be prompting some buyers to get into the market, which could lead to a surprisingly busy November and December, a time of the year when home sales activity usually slows,” said Lisa Sturtevant, chief economist at Bright MLS.Home purchase loan applications rose nearly 6 per cent last week to their highest level since September, despite the modest rate increase, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.The recent drop in mortgage rates has also benefited homeowners refinancing existing loans. Refinancing applications accounted for about 56 per cent of total mortgage activity last week, a slight dip from the previous week.Rates began easing in July, ahead of the Federal Reserve’s September decision to cut its main interest rate for the first time in a year, amid growing concerns over labour market conditions. Despite another rate cut last month, Fed Chair Jerome Powell cautioned that future reductions were “not guaranteed.”According to CME Group data, traders have trimmed expectations of another Fed rate cut in December to 53 per cent, down from nearly 70 per cent a week earlier.While the Fed does not directly set mortgage rates, its short-term rate moves influence borrowing costs indirectly. When the central bank made its first rate cut in over four years last autumn, mortgage rates unexpectedly climbed above 7 per cent in January 2023, as the 10-year Treasury yield approached 5 per cent.Despite rates falling from their 2025 highs, housing affordability remains a major hurdle following sharp property price increases. The Trump administration’s recent proposal to introduce 50-year mortgages to address the affordability crisis has drawn criticism from several economists and policymakers.","The 30-year US mortgage rate rose slightly for the second consecutive week but stayed close to its lowest level of the year.

Ford CEO highlights widening gap between open jobs and available talent

The fallout of shrinking trade education

What companies like Ford are doing to retain workers

A generational shift and one silver lining





Ford Motor Company CEO Jim Farley has issued one of his starkest warnings yet about America’s labour future, revealing that the company is struggling to fill 5,000 skilled-mechanic roles despite offering salaries of around $120,000. Calling it a “serious problem” for the country, Farley said the shortage of trained workers is no longer an industry issue. It is a national crisis that threatens manufacturing, emergency services and the trades that keep the US economy functioning.Farley shared the figures during an appearance on the Office Hours: Business Edition podcast, saying Ford is not alone in the struggle. Across the US, more than one million skilled-trade and manual-labour positions remain vacant, including jobs in emergency response, trucking, plumbing, electrical work, manufacturing and factory operations.“We are in trouble in our country,” Farley warned, pointing out that many of these jobs form the backbone of American industry. Despite competitive pay, including six-figure packages at Ford, the talent pipeline simply is not keeping up with demand.Recent federal data backs him up. As of August, more than 400,000 manufacturing jobs were open nationwide, even with unemployment rising to 4.3 percent. This is a sign that the labour gap is driven not by job scarcity but by a dramatic decline in the supply of trained workers.One of the biggest problems, Farley argues, is the collapse of trade-based education and apprenticeships. He highlighted that becoming a top-tier mechanic or technician, for example someone who can remove a diesel engine from a Ford Super Duty truck, requires years of training and hands-on experience.“We do not have trade schools,” Farley said, criticising decades of underinvestment in vocational education. “We are not educating the next generation of people like my grandfather, who built a middle-class life.”His reference is personal. Farley’s own grandfather was employee No. 389 at Ford and worked on the Model T, a reminder of how factory and trade work once propelled millions into stable livelihoods.Farley noted that Ford has already taken major steps to make its jobs more appealing. The company eliminated the lowest tier in its wage structure and agreed to a 25 percent pay increase over four years as part of its contract with the United Auto Workers in 2023.Yet even with improved pay and benefits, skilled-trade positions remain among the hardest in America to fill, a sign, Farley says, that the issue is structural, not simply financial.Interestingly, Farley suggested younger Americans may be key to solving the crisis. After years of declining interest in trade jobs, Gen Z is now pushing back against the traditional college-only pathway, with trade-school enrolment rising 16 percent last year, the highest since tracking began in 2018.The surge reflects growing frustration with student debt and a renewed awareness that skilled jobs can offer stability, mobility and strong salaries, often without a four-year degree.But while this trend is encouraging, Farley cautioned that it may not be enough to close the labour gap quickly. Skilled trades require long training curves, and decades of underinvestment mean it will take years to rebuild the pipeline.Farley’s warning is blunt. Without rapid reinvestment in training, apprenticeships and vocational pathways, the US risks choking its own economic engine. From repairing vehicles and maintaining infrastructure to keeping factories running, the trades remain essential and the shortage is becoming too large to ignore.","Ford Motor Company CEO Jim Farley has issued one of his starkest warnings yet about America’s labour future.

Stock markets in the United States were at a low as investors await further economic indicators. The S&P 500 declined by 0.4% in early Thursday trading, moving away from its recent record high achieved in the previous month.The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 41 points, while the Nasdaq composite fell 0.7%. After the longest shutdown in its history lasting six weeks, the US government has resumed operations.Investors are bracing for possible market fluctuations as the government begins issuing crucial updates regarding employment figures and other economic indicators. The United States government has reopened after a six-week shutdown — the longest in its history. While the stock market largely gained during the closure, as it has in previous shutdowns, Wall Street is now bracing for potential volatility as the government resumes publishing key economic data, including job market and inflation reports.Investors are concerned that fresh data could prompt the Federal Reserve to pause its interest rate cuts. Although such cuts typically support economic growth, they also risk fuelling inflation.Wall Street’s recent rally to record highs has been driven in part by expectations of continued rate reductions, and a change in that outlook could weigh on stocks.The “looming data deluge may spur additional volatility in the coming weeks,” said Doug Beath, global equity strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute.Traders have scaled back expectations for another rate cut at the Fed’s next meeting in December, now pricing in a roughly 54 per cent chance — down from nearly 70 per cent a week earlier, according to CME Group data.That shift pushed bond yields slightly higher, a move that typically pressures stock prices. The yield on the 10-year US Treasury rose to 4.10 per cent from 4.08 per cent late Wednesday.On Wall Street, The Walt Disney Co. was among the biggest drags on the market, sliding 8.4 per cent. The entertainment major reported quarterly profits that topped analysts’ estimates, but revenue came in below expectations. Cisco Systems, however, rose 4.6 per cent after posting stronger-than-expected profit and revenue.Overseas, markets were mixed — European indexes fluctuated while Asian markets posted modest gains. Japan’s Nikkei 225 climbed 0.4 per cent even as tech giant SoftBank Group dropped another 3.4 per cent after disclosing it had sold its entire stake in chipmaker Nvidia.Concerns are mounting globally about whether Nvidia and other high-flying artificial intelligence stocks can sustain their massive gains. Their soaring valuations — which have helped drive US markets to record highs despite slowing job growth and persistent inflation — have drawn comparisons to the dot-com bubble of 2000, when the S&P 500 later plunged nearly 50 per cent after the crash.Nvidia fell another 2.9 per cent on Thursday, exerting the heaviest drag on the S&P 500.

Piyush Goyal Sends Strong Reply To Donald Trump, Says India Wants Fair But Balanced Trade Agreement





The global oil market is tilting towards oversupply as production growth continues to outpace consumption despite a rise in Chinese demand, according to the International Energy Agency’s (IEA) latest monthly report released on Thursday.The IEA projected that worldwide oil production will exceed demand by more than four million barrels per day (bpd) in 2026, following an upward revision in its global supply forecast.“Global oil market balances are looking increasingly lopsided, as world oil supply is forging ahead while oil demand growth remains modest by historical standards,” the agency said, as quoted by AFP.The IEA noted several uncertainties influencing its projections, including the economic fallout of tariff disputes, US government shutdown (which is ending as Trump signs order), and the impact of Western sanctions on Russia, a major oil producer.Global oil output is expected to rise by 3.1 million bpd in 2025 and by an additional 2.5 million bpd in 2026. While consumption is also growing, its pace remains far slower than supply expansion.Demand growth is forecast to decline in the fourth quarter of 2025 compared with the previous quarter, “adding to market balances that look increasingly askew,” the report stated.Despite the imbalance, Brent crude prices edged slightly higher to 63.05 dollars per barrel on Thursday, though they remain down around 17 per cent over the past year.","The IEA projected that worldwide oil production will exceed demand by more than four million barrels per day in 2026.

No rush to buy





China’s ports are brimming with soybeans after months of record imports, dimming hopes for US exporters even as Trump and Xi reached a new trade understanding including fresh purchase commitments from Beijing.Massive reserves, weak processing margins and cheaper South American supplies have combined to stall demand for US beans.“State firms may be waiting for margins to recover before making large-scale purchases,” said Johnny Xiang, founder of Beijing-based AgRadar Consulting. “Even with tariff waivers, margins remain negative and Brazilian beans are still cheaper.”Following a meeting between Donald Trump and Xi Jinping last month, US officials announced that China had agreed to buy 12 million tonnes of soybeans before the year ends and 25 million tonnes annually for the next three years. But Beijing has yet to publicly confirm those figures. While retaliatory tariffs on US imports were suspended, state trader COFCO has so far booked only a handful of cargoes for December and January, according to market participants.China’s early-year rush to secure soybeans from South America, prompted by fears that the trade conflict could persist, has left the country sitting on unusually large inventories.Data from Sublime China Information show port stocks at a record 10.3 million tonnes as of November 7, up 3.6 million tonnes year-on-year. Crushers, firms that turn beans into oil and meal, held 7.5 million tonnes, their highest since 2017.The oversupply has weighed heavily on prices. Soymeal, used to feed China’s vast pig population, has fallen by more than 20% since April, now hovering around 3,000 yuan ($421) a tonne in major coastal regions including Tianjin, Shandong, Jiangsu and Guangdong, according to Mysteel data.Profit margins for crushers have been negative since mid-year, with losses this week around 190 yuan per tonne in the processing hub of Rizhao. Analysts see little improvement before March. “There is not much room for China to increase soybean imports,” said a trader with a global oilseed processor. “Soybean stocks are huge and demand for the feed sector is very slow.”Expectations that China’s state-owned importers, COFCO and Sinograin, would quickly ramp up purchases after trade talks have so far proved unfounded. Even so, Washington appears to be holding Beijing to its reported promises.“The administration expects our trading partners to adhere to their deal commitments,” a US official told Reuters. “The president reserves the right to adjust tariff rates, export controls, and other concessions to hold our trading partners accountable to their deal commitments.”Traders estimate that state stockpiles stand at between 40 million and 45 million tonnes, roughly double last year’s US imports and enough to satisfy five months of early-year consumption.Meanwhile, private importers are favouring Brazil, where January cargoes are quoted at about $480 a tonne including freight, compared with $540–$550 for U.S. shipments. December bookings from Brazil total roughly 2 million tonnes, covering more than 40% of China’s expected monthly demand, with January purchases still slow.As Arlan Suderman, chief commodities economist at StoneX, noted in a Tuesday briefing, “There’s very little indication that state buyers are engaged in a programme to purchase 12 million metric tons ahead of the end of this year, let alone 25 million tons more for calendar year 2026.”",China’s ports are brimming with soybeans after months of record imports.

Who will get it ?





Possible timeline





Legal and political uncertainty





US President Donald Trump has revived one of his most unusual economic ideas, sending rebate cheques to Americans funded by the tariffs his administration has imposed. The announcement comes amid growing concerns about affordability across the United States.“People that are against Tariffs are FOOLS!” Trump wrote on Truth Social on Sunday. “A dividend of at least $2000 a person (not including high income people!) will be paid to everyone.”The president’s pitch builds on similar statements made in recent months.Back in August, Trump announced, “We’re taking in so much money that we may very well make a dividend to the people of America.” His claim is that the payments would come directly from the tariff revenue collected from US importers rather than taxpayer funds, a structure he argues sets it apart from the pandemic stimulus cheques distributed in 2020 and 2021.While importers are the ones who pay tariffs upfront, economists note that much of that cost is passed on to consumers through higher prices. Trump’s idea, therefore, would attempt to redistribute the same money that Americans have indirectly paid through tariffs, CNN reported.The proposal drew a cautious response from treasury secretary Scott Bessent, who said on ABC’s This Week that there is no formal plan to issue such payments.He added that Trump’s mention of a $2,000 figure “could come in lots of forms,” including adjustments related to untaxed tips, overtime or Social Security payments.The US treasury has reported that total tariff revenue collected stands at more than $220 billion, covering both tariffs imposed under Trump’s leadership and those established before his presidency.However, as per the Internal Revenue Service’s figures over 163 million Americans filed tax returns in 2024. Which means that if each filer received $2,000, the total cost would reach about $326 billion, far more than the revenue available.Even with an income cap at $100,000, roughly 150 million adults would still qualify, requiring around $300 billion, Erica York, vice president of federal tax policy at the Tax Foundation told CNN.Despite the shortfall, Trump claimed there would still be funds left to reduce the national debt. “All money left over from the $2000 payments made to low and middle income USA Citizens, from the massive Tariff Income pouring into our Country from foreign countries, which will be substantial, will be used to SUBSTANTIALLY PAY DOWN NATIONAL DEBT,” he wrote on Monday.A White House official declined to give details on eligibility, saying only, “The Administration is committed to putting this money to good use for the American people,” in a statement to CNN.If the plan moves ahead, the timeline for payments would likely vary. During the pandemic, Americans who opted for direct deposits received funds within a week of approval, while those waiting for paper cheques often had to wait nearly five months.The legality of the plan could face scrutiny in the Supreme Court, which has signalled concern over the administration’s use of emergency powers to impose tariffs. Nearly $100 billion of the total collected stems from those powers. A ruling against the administration could force a refund to businesses, significantly reducing available funds for any rebate programme.Beyond the courts, Congress would also have to approve the payments. The legislative branch controls federal spending, and past stimulus cheques required its consent. Whether Trump could gather sufficient support remains unclear, according to CNN.Historically, direct payments to households have been issued during recessions or national emergencies. With the economy not currently in either condition, economists warn that rebate cheques could intensify inflation, the very issue many Americans cite as their top concern. If inflation rises, the Federal Reserve may be compelled to increase interest rates again, creating fresh political and economic pressure.","US President Donald Trump has revived one of his most unusual economic ideas, sending rebate cheques to Americans funded by tariffs.

End of an era: US penny bids goodbye after last coin pressed in Philadelphia; 238 years old currency finally retires after Trump's order,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/end-of-an-era-us-penny-bids-goodbye-after-last-coin-pressed-in-philadelphia-238-years-old-currency-finally-retires-after-trumps-order/articleshow/125290544.cms,"A chaotic farewell - No pennies left to pay



Counting the change

‘Time to go away’







After more than two centuries of jingling in pockets and cash drawers, the American penny has reached the end of its life.The final batch of one-cent coins was pressed this week at the US Mint in Philadelphia, an event overseen by US Treasurer Brandon Beach.Earlier in February, US President Donald Trump announced that he has asked the Mint to end penny production, saying the tiny coin had become too expensive to make. Each penny now costs nearly four cents to produce, more than its actual value.Beach confirmed that the last coins made will be auctioned off, while the final pennies to enter circulation were struck in June. Despite the halt, all existing pennies will remain legal tender.The penny, first issued in 1787, predates the Mint itself by six years. It outlived its half-penny sibling by 168 years and leaves behind the nickel, dime, quarter and the little-used half-dollar and dollar coins. Once able to buy “penny candy” or pay a parking meter, the coin now lives mostly in dusty jars or “take a penny, leave a penny” trays.What should have been a quiet retirement has turned messy as retailers across the country are struggling to manage prices and payments without the one-cent coin.Some are rounding prices to the nearest nickel, often a cent or two higher, while others are asking customers to pay with pennies if they still have them. But state laws that require exact pricing are making things complicated.And while ending penny production should save money, the government might end up spending more by pressing extra nickels, which are even costlier to make.Mark Weller, executive director of Americans for Common Cents told CNN that the government’s ruling out of the penny has been “a bit chaotic.”“By the time we reach Christmas, the problems will be more pronounced with retailers not having pennies.”Weller noted that other nations, including Canada, Australia and Switzerland, handled similar transitions with clear guidance.“We had a social media post (by Trump) during Super Bowl Sunday, but no real plan for what retailers would have to do,” he said.One of the first to act was Kwik Trip, a family-run convenience store chain in the Midwest. It decided to round down cash purchases in stores short on pennies.“There’s no way that we wanted to charge (customers) an extra 2 cents because we just didn’t think that was fair,” John McHugh, the company’s spokesperson told CNN.“I mean, it’s not their fault that there’s a penny shortage.”The move will cost Kwik Trip dearly, a couple of million dollars a year, McHugh said, with 20 million customers annually and nearly one in five paying in cash.Consumers will also feel a small pinch. A Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond study in July estimated that rounding to the nearest nickel could cost households about five cents a year, totalling $6 million nationwide.But not every state allows rounding. Delaware, Connecticut, Michigan and Oregon, along with major cities including New York, Philadelphia, Miami and Washington DC, still require exact change.The rules also clash with the federal SNAP food assistance programme, which must charge users the same as everyone else. Because SNAP payments are electronic and precise, rounding for cash customers could land stores in legal trouble.“Rounding down on all transactions presents several challenges beyond the loss of an average of 2 cents per transaction,” said Jeff Lenard, spokesperson for the National Association of Convenience Stores (NACS). “We desperately need legislation that allows rounding so retailers can make change for these customers.”NACS and several retail groups have already written to Congress asking for clear legislation to cover payments now that the penny is gone.The penny was among America’s first coins, designed before the Mint even existed. Benjamin Franklin is widely credited with creating the first version, known as the Fugio cent. The modern Lincoln penny arrived in 1909 to honour the 100th anniversary of Abraham Lincoln’s birth — the first American coin to carry a president’s face.Roughly 300 billion pennies are thought to be in circulation today, worth less than $9 for every American. Most, though, rarely change hands.Still, for some, the coin’s disappearance feels personal. Joe Ditler, a 74-year-old writer and historian from Colorado, keeps a cigar box full of pennies passed down from his grandfather.He remembers flattening them on train tracks and making souvenirs from them in amusement parks. “They bring back memories that have stayed with me all my life,” he said.“The penny has had a wonderful life. But it’s probably time for it to go away.”","The penny, first issued in 1787, predates the Mint itself by six years.

Asian markets traded mostly in red on Thursday as excitement over the end of the United States’ record government shutdown quickly lost steam. With the focus shifting back to the Federal Reserve’s next interest rate decision and mounting fears of a technology sector bubble, investors showed little appetite for risk.Nikkei jumped 88 points or 0.17% to 51,152. Shanghai and Shenzhen also inched higher, adding 17 and 238 points respectively.Meanwhile in Hong Kong, HSI dipped 156 points or 0.58% to 26,766. Kospi also traded marginally down, shedding 2 points at 10 AM IST.US lawmakers late on Wednesday approved a bill to end the 43-day shutdown that had paralysed government operations and delayed key economic reports. Later, US President Donald Trump signed the legislation, officially reopening departments that were shuttered for weeks.But despite the breakthrough, trading sentiment was subdued. Investors are now awaiting the release of data that had been held up during the closure, hoping it will offer clues on the health of the world’s largest economy and help shape the Fed’s policy outlook.Still, the White House said October’s employment and inflation numbers might remain unavailable because data collection was interrupted during the stoppage.“Reopening also doesn't mean an instant snap-back to normal for the real economy. When you starve a system of staffing and pay for six weeks, the backlog doesn't vanish just because a bill passed at 8 pm,” wrote Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management. “The shutdown ends with a vote and a signature; the aftershocks show up in queues, call centres and cash-flow stress far away from the Capitol dome,” AFP further cited the analyst.Market caution was also amplified by concerns that the AI-driven boom in technology stocks has pushed valuations too far. Analysts warned that heavy investments in artificial intelligence could take longer than expected to generate returns, sparking fears of an eventual correction.The Nasdaq slipped for a second straight day, while the S&P 500 also struggled. In contrast, the Dow Jones Industrial Average reached a record close, helped by speculation that investors were shifting money from tech firms into traditional industrial stocks.Oil prices continued to fall after a steep four percent drop on Wednesday, following OPEC’s revised forecast that global crude markets would face a surplus in the third quarter. The group had previously projected a shortfall for the same period. The downgrade, combined with easing tensions in the Middle East and rising output among major producers, has dragged prices lower. The International Energy Agency has also projected record surpluses by 2026.In currency markets, Japan drew attention as the yen slid further. Finance Minister Satsuki Katayama told parliament on Wednesday that “the government is watching for any excessive and disorderly moves with a high sense of urgency.”Since her comments, the currency has weakened to nearly 155 per dollar, fuelling speculation that Tokyo may consider intervention. The decline comes as Japan’s central bank maintains its dovish stance on monetary policy, while US markets stabilise following the government’s reopening.","Nikkei jumped 88 points or 0.17% to 51,152.

Shutdown strain: Small US businesses reel under halted contracts; firms weigh layoffs as Congress moves to end deadlock,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/shutdown-strain-small-us-businesses-reel-under-halted-contracts-firms-weigh-layoffs-as-congress-moves-to-end-deadlock/articleshow/125280380.cms,"U.S Shutdown Twist: Inside Capitol Hill’s 36-Hour Sprint to Reopen America; All Eyes On House Dems





Small businesses across the United States that rely on federal contracts and funding are facing a severe cash crunch as the country’s longest-ever government shutdown stretches into its seventh week, forcing owners to cut costs, delay payments, and even consider layoffs, according to AP report.Lawmakers are returning to Washington to vote on a stopgap funding bill that would reopen the government through January 30. While the measure is expected to pass the Republican-controlled House despite opposition from most Democrats, small business owners say the shutdown has already caused deep disruptions that will take months to recover from.For entrepreneurs like Jackson Dalton, owner of Black Box Safety, a California-based maker of protective gear, the shutdown’s effects have been immediate.Dalton had secured a $1.9 million federal contract just a day before the shutdown began on October 1, requiring an initial $1 million outlay. “It’s had a major impact on our cash flow and operations,” he told AP, adding that suppliers had been “freaking out” as they awaited new orders.For some business owners, the uncertainty has led to difficult choices. Eric Veal, founder of Interactive Knowledge in North Carolina — which develops digital exhibits for museums and cultural institutions — said 60% of his business depends on the Smithsonian Institution, which operates under partial federal funding.With federal staff unable to work, “projects are at a complete halt,” he said.Veal has cut expenses and may be forced to consider layoffs if the shutdown extends beyond mid-November. “Our cash flow is affected, and we’ve marked November 15 on the calendar as the date to start considering those steps,” he said, noting that the crisis had made him rethink his company’s reliance on federal projects.The prolonged shutdown has also overshadowed other business priorities. At a recent Goldman Sachs 10,000 Small Businesses summit in Washington, attended by around 2,000 entrepreneurs, participants said their planned discussions on access to capital, AI adoption, and workforce policies were derailed by uncertainty around government operations.Joe Gelardi, CEO of Virginia-based Vectrona, which provides technology and training to defence clients, said his firm had not received payments for ongoing contracts. “We keep working because we don’t want to harm the relationship with our government customers,” he said. “But it’s really unfortunate that the burden is being transferred to us to fund and manage work the government can’t process.”Some businesses are facing outright cancellations. Karen Jenkins, founder of KRJ Consulting in South Carolina, said a major management consulting contract that was supposed to be renewed this year was scrapped amid the shutdown. “It’s affected us almost as badly as the pandemic,” she said. “We’re just trying to hold on and hope we can be a resource again when the government reopens.”Economists warn that small contractors are among the hardest hit by the impasse since they typically lack the reserves that large corporations can rely on during prolonged funding freezes. Even after the shutdown ends, many may face months of backlog, delayed payments, and lost business opportunities as federal agencies scramble to restart operations.As one small business owner put it: “We’ve survived on resilience before — but this time, even resilience is starting to run out.”",Small businesses across the U.S. that rely on federal contracts and funding are facing a severe cash crunch.

Artificial intelligence firm Anthropic on Wednesday unveiled an ambitious $50 billion plan to build a new network of data centres in collaboration with UK-based Fluidstack, signalling its intent to expand rapidly as global demand for AI infrastructure surges, AFP reported.The facilities -- to be built initially in Texas and New York --will form the foundation of Anthropic’s long-term push to power its growing suite of AI tools and services. The company said additional locations across the United States are also being considered.“These new sites will help us develop more advanced AI systems capable of driving scientific and technological breakthroughs, while also creating jobs across the country,” said CEO Dario Amodei.The announcement comes as technology firms worldwide rush to add data centre capacity, which forms the backbone of large-scale AI models.

US stocks moved in mixed trade on Wednesday as investors balanced renewed enthusiasm for artificial intelligence (AI) plays with lingering concerns over inflated tech valuations and slowing economic signals. The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged 309 points, or 0.6%, to hit another record, while the S&P 500 dipped 0.1%, staying close to its all-time high. The Nasdaq Composite, weighed down by tech losses, slipped 0.5%, AP reported.Chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) led market gains, jumping 9.6% after CEO Lisa Su forecast that the company’s revenue could grow at an annual compounded rate above 35% over the next three to five years, driven by what she called “accelerating AI momentum.”The upbeat outlook gave investors a boost after several volatile sessions for AI-linked stocks.However, analysts said concerns remain that the current rally in artificial intelligence shares mirrors the excesses of the early 2000s dot-com bubble. Nvidia, the sector’s bellwether, oscillated between gains and losses during the session after sliding 4.6% this month. Despite dominating AI chipmaking, its stock’s meteoric rise — doubling in four of the last five years — has left investors debating whether prices have outpaced fundamentals.Wall Street’s broader advance has been fuelled by tech megacaps, even as parts of the US economy show signs of cooling. IBM rose 2.3% after announcing what it called a breakthrough in “bringing truly useful quantum computing to the world,” according to Jay Gambetta, director of IBM Research. The development marks another step in the race among major tech firms to commercialise quantum computing and tackle complex problems traditional systems can’t handle.Elsewhere, On Holdings, the Swiss sportswear company, soared 20.3% after reporting a much larger-than-expected quarterly profit, while Circle Internet Group, a major cryptocurrency issuer, tumbled nearly 10% despite strong earnings. The stock has plunged from almost $300 in June to below $90 amid weakening sentiment toward crypto-linked equities.In the bond market, the yield on the benchmark 10-year US Treasury note eased to 4.06% from 4.13% after trading resumed following Tuesday’s Veterans Day holiday. Lower yields typically make equities more attractive by reducing returns on bonds. Traders continue to price in a roughly two-thirds chance that the Federal Reserve will deliver a rate cut in December, data from CME Group showed.However, Fed Chair Jerome Powell recently cautioned that another cut this year is “far from certain,” warning against fuelling inflation, which remains above the central bank’s 2% target. The Fed’s visibility has also been hindered by the ongoing US government shutdown — the longest in history — which has paused the release of key data on inflation, jobs, and consumer spending. Economists say this data gap complicates policy decisions and adds uncertainty to markets.Globally, equities gained ground. France’s CAC 40 climbed 1.2%, South Korea’s Kospi gained 1.1%, and Japan’s Nikkei 225 advanced 0.4%. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index rose 0.9%, while China’s Shanghai Composite closed nearly flat.Analysts said investor sentiment remains cautiously optimistic as hopes of an imminent end to the US shutdown and expectations for AI-led growth continue to counterbalance valuation concerns in tech-heavy sectors.","The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged 309 points, or 0.6%, to hit another record.

The TOI correspondent from Washington:

'You Don’t Have Talent in US': Donald Trump’s Shocking Shift on H-1B Visa Policy Debate





US President Donald Trump’s blunt declaration that America “doesn’t have certain talents” detonated an epic meltdown across MAGA circles on Wednesday, with his Fox News interview that touched on the subject of H1-B visas and foreign students exposing a widening chasm between the MAGA boss and his base.“No, you don’t—no you don’t,” Trump snapped when Fox News’ Laura Ingraham insisted during an interview that the U.S. already has “plenty of talented people,” arguing that if the President wanted to raise wages for American workers, he can’t flood the country hundreds of thousands of foreign workers,”“I agree—but you also do have to bring in talent,” Trump fired back. “We have plenty of talented people here,” Ingraham countered. “No, you don’t… You don’t have certain talents. And people have to learn. You can’t take people off an unemployment line and say, ‘I’m going to put you into a factory, we’re going to make missiles.’ It’s not an easy thing. Very dangerous, a lot of explosions, a lot of problems.”Trump also doubled down with a real-world example: a September 2025 ICE raid on a Hyundai EV battery plant in Georgia, where more than 400 South Koreans, many with H-1B visas, were briefly detained after complaints by a local MAGA activist.“They had like 500 or 600 people… to make batteries and to teach people how to do it,... they (MAGA) wanted them out of the country. You’re going to need that, Laura. I know you and I disagree on this. ”Trump also defended the inflow of foreign students opposed by MAGA hardliners, calling it essential to prop up U.S. universities. “You don’t want to cut half the people, half the students from all over the world, destroy our university and college system,” he said, referring to plans to admit up to 600,000 Chinese students annually on F-1 visas, which MAGA hardliners say is a gateway for intellectual property theft.The exchange instantly became the rallying cry for a furious backlash that lit up X, formerly Twitter, owned by one-time pro-H1B MAGA supporter Elon Musk – with hashtags like #MAGARevolt and #TalentGate.“This is Davos in a red tie! Telling American engineers and factory workers we lack talent? Then flooding campuses with CCP-linked students? It’s a gut-punch to every voter who bled for this movement. Wake up, Mr. President—this isn’t MAGA, it’s Chamber of Commerce betrayal,” raged former Trump aide Steve Bannon on his War Room podcast.MAGA gadabout Laura Loomer, a pro-Trump firebrand, said the President had to fix the problem or face the fire. “‘No, you don’t have talent. That’s what Trump just told 74 million Americans. H-1Bs over STEM grads, 600K Chinese visas while tuition bankrupts families—this is globalism with a red hat,” she said. And from MAGA influencer Jack Posobiec: “Insult of the year: Trump says Americans can’t build missiles without foreign babysitters. H-1B + Chinese student surge = Trojan horse for Beijing. America First means Americans first. Period.”White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt downplayed the uproar, telling reporters: ""The president is threading the needle – protecting borders while supercharging American innovation. MAGA knows results over rhetoric.""But surveys show Trump’s MAGA base is getting increasingly disenchanted with his gilded era where billionaires and foreign leaders strut through the Oval Office while they continue to get slammed economically. The perception that foreign students and guest workers are damaging to the U.S-born is now so strong that Nalin Haley, son of the Indian-American former governor of South Carolina Nikki Haley, daughter of Sikh immigrants who is not exactly pro-MAGA, is advocating a ban on H1B visas and even legal immigration, framing them as a direct threat to American youth employment and cultural assimilation.""Every friend from my high school group has a college degree from great schools, but none of them have jobs even after searching for more than a year... So when you see a bunch of foreigners coming over here to take jobs that they wanted, they have every right to be pissed, and I'm pissed for them,” he said in a recent interview, igniting a firestorm in immigrant circles about betraying his immigrant heritage.","'You Don't Have Talent in US': Donald Trump’s Shocking Shift on H-1B Visa Policy Debate.

TTP Owns Up to Islamabad Attack, Pak PM Points Finger at India & Afghanistan

Talks collapse amid growing hostilities

Economic and political fallout





Afghanistan’s Taliban government on Wednesday said that it is seeking alternative trade routes through Central Asia as border closures with Pakistan continue to cripple commerce and worsen economic losses.Acting commerce minister Nooruddin Azizi said that the country is losing nearly $200 million every month due to the shutdown of key crossings with Pakistan, accusing Islamabad of “politically motivated” restrictions.“Pakistan has frequently created obstacles, especially during the fruit export season,” Azizi said during a session in Kabul. “These closures are without any foundational or logical basis, and they are damaging to both countries.”At least five major crossings, including Torkham and Spin Boldak, have been closed for more than a month following a sharp deterioration in relations.The closures have disrupted trade, halted exports and caused significant losses for Afghan businesses that rely heavily on overland access to Pakistani ports, according to Afghanistan news channel Amu TV.Calling the Pakistan route “high-risk,” Azizi said Afghan traders have repeatedly suffered losses due to arbitrary decisions by Pakistani authorities.He urged merchants to strengthen economic ties with Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan instead.“We are actively working with northern neighbors to find reliable trade alternatives,” he said. Azizi added that the Taliban government would only trade with Pakistan on the basis of “mutual respect and equality.”“There will be no trade under duress. We are under no obligation,” he said.Azizi also accused Pakistan of exploiting Afghan traders and using commerce as political leverage.“Our traders should not be tools in Pakistan’s hands,” he said. “If Pakistani traders want access to Afghan markets, they must handle marketing and outreach themselves. We will not allow one-sided conditions.”The minister’s remarks came days after Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif declared that dialogue between Islamabad and Kabul had collapsed. He said that the negotiations had “entered an indefinite phase” after two rounds of talks in Istanbul failed to reach an agreement.The collapse in talks follows weeks of cross-border clashes that have killed civilians and soldiers on both sides, marking the most serious escalation in years. The violence began after explosions in Kabul and Paktika on October 9, which the Afghan government blamed on Pakistan.Pakistan has neither confirmed nor denied involvement, but its military later said it had carried out retaliatory strikes targeting militant hideouts and army posts across the border.Military spokesman Lt Gen Ahmad Sharif said more than 200 Afghan soldiers and 100 militants were killed in the strikes, while Afghan officials claimed only nine soldiers had died and accused Pakistan of killing civilians.Afghan spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid said 45 civilians were killed and over 100 wounded, while claiming 58 Pakistani soldiers had died, figures Islamabad disputes, saying 23 soldiers were killed.The clashes has coincided with rising economic strain inside Afghanistan. With border routes blocked, exports have fallen sharply, inflation has increased and traders face growing uncertainty.Pakistan remains one of Afghanistan’s largest trading partners, with annual trade worth over $1.5 billion before the latest closures. But with relations deteriorating, Afghan authorities are now encouraging exporters to redirect goods through northern corridors linked to Central Asia.“Our traders should not be tools in Pakistan’s hands. If Pakistani traders want access to Afghan markets, they must handle marketing and outreach themselves. We will not allow one-sided conditions,” Azizi said.The two countries share a 2,611-kilometre frontier, known as the Durand Line, drawn during British rule in 1893.Afghanistan has never formally recognised it as an international border, a long-standing source of friction that continues to fuel political and security disputes.Despite mediation efforts by Qatar and Turkey, both sides remain entrenched, with no sign of an immediate resolution. Analysts warn that if the border deadlock persists, it could deepen Afghanistan’s economic crisis and further isolate the landlocked nation.","Afghanistan is losing nearly $200 million every month due to the shutdown of key crossings with Pakistan. At least five major crossings, including Torkham and Spin Boldak, have been closed for more than a month. The closures have disrupted trade, halted exports and caused significant losses for Afghan businesses.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125274864,imgsize-475283,width-400,resizemode-4/.jpg"
Supply chain shift: GM tells suppliers to exit China by 2027; move signals deeper US-China trade decoupling,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/supply-chain-shift-gm-tells-suppliers-to-exit-china-by-2027-move-signals-deeper-us-china-trade-decoupling/articleshow/125274256.cms,"'India Won’t Be A Dumping Ground': Piyush Goyal Blasts China For Unfair And Unethical Trade Practice

Automakers brace for tariff shocks and rare-earth curbs

A complex and costly transition for suppliers





General Motors (GM) has asked thousands of its suppliers to eliminate parts sourced from China by 2027, in one of the auto industry’s most aggressive moves yet to insulate its operations from deepening US-China trade tensions, Reuters reported, citing four people familiar with the matter.According to the report, GM has directed suppliers to find alternative sources for raw materials and components, with the eventual goal of moving its entire supply chain out of China. The automaker first approached some suppliers with this directive in late 2024, but the push gained momentum earlier this year amid an escalating trade conflict between Washington and Beijing.GM executives told suppliers the move is part of a broader strategy to enhance “supply chain resiliency,” Reuters said. The company’s leadership has repeatedly cited the need to mitigate risks arising from geopolitical disruptions, such as rare-earth bottlenecks and computer-chip shortages that have plagued global automakers since 2021.The directive covers parts and materials used in vehicles manufactured in North America — GM’s biggest production hub — and extends to countries like Russia and Venezuela, which face similar US trade restrictions.However, China remains the largest source of affected components, Reuters reported.The automaker, which has already diversified its sourcing of electric vehicle materials by investing in a US lithium mine and partnering with a domestic rare-earth company, is now broadening its efforts to include basic parts and industrial inputs.GM declined to comment on its supplier discussions. However, CEO Mary Barra told investors during an October earnings call, “We’ve been working now for a few years to have supply chain resiliency… sourcing parts in the same country where we build the cars, whenever possible.”Shilpan Amin, GM’s global purchasing chief, reiterated at a recent industry event that the company can no longer rely solely on the lowest-cost countries. “Resiliency is important — making sure you have more control over your supply chain and you know exactly what is coming from where,” Amin said, according to Reuters.The decision comes despite recent signs of easing trade tensions. Following an October meeting between US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping, both nations agreed to roll back select tariffs and export restrictions. But automakers remain wary, Reuters noted, as the sector continues to face fallout from unpredictable trade dynamics.Earlier this year, China restricted exports of rare-earth materials crucial for car electronics, sending automakers scrambling to stockpile supplies. The situation worsened in October when Beijing expanded those restrictions, triggering warnings of widespread factory disruptions.Adding to the strain, a separate dispute between Chinese and Dutch authorities led China to halt shipments from Nexperia, a major supplier of low-cost automotive chips, further fuelling concerns about the fragility of global production networks.Industry executives told Reuters that reconfiguring supply chains away from China will take years and entail significant costs. China’s dominance in key manufacturing areas -- from automotive lighting to tooling and die-making — makes it difficult for suppliers to quickly pivot.“It’s a big effort. Suppliers are scrambling,” one senior executive at a major auto parts manufacturer told Reuters.Collin Shaw, president of MEMA, the Vehicle Suppliers Association, said carmakers and their partners have been working to “de-risk” supply chains, but decades of dependence on Chinese manufacturing won’t be easy to undo.“In some cases, this has been 20 or 30 years in the making, and we’re trying to undo it in a few years,” Shaw told Reuters. “It’s not going to happen that fast.”GM’s move, analysts say, reflects a broader industry trend --an attempt to balance economic realities with national security imperatives as the world’s two largest economies continue to reshape global trade rules.","General Motors (GM) has asked thousands of its suppliers to eliminate parts sourced from China by 2027.

"Travel chaos: US shutdown hits airlines hard as 8,000 flights cancelled; carriers brace for costly holiday ripple effects",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/travel-chaos-us-shutdown-hits-airlines-hard-as-8000-flights-cancelled-carriers-brace-for-costly-holiday-ripple-effects/articleshow/125274053.cms,"1000+ Flights Cancelled As Shutdown Severely Impacts American Aviation Sector





The longest federal government shutdown in US history has upended airlines’ holiday quarter expectations, grounding thousands of flights and forcing carriers to scramble for contingency plans as operations across the country remain crippled.Airlines, which had been counting on a rebound in corporate and leisure travel, are now seeing Thanksgiving bookings grow by just 1% since late October — roughly half the expected pace, according to aviation analytics firm Cirium, Reuters reported. The slump underscores travellers’ hesitation amid the prolonged shutdown.The Senate on Monday approved a bill to restore federal funding, raising hopes that the shutdown could end within the week.However, industry executives warned disruptions would likely persist. According to FlightAware data, over 8,000 flights were cancelled in the past four days — nearly double the cancellations seen in the entire first month of the shutdown. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has since ordered progressive flight cuts at 40 major airports.Widespread cancellations have left pilots and crew reaching their federally mandated duty limits before completing routes, forcing airlines to reshuffle schedules.Delta and United have offered premium pay to incentivise pilots and flight attendants to take additional trips, while other carriers are relying heavily on reserve crews, Reuters reported.JetBlue’s senior vice president of system operations and airports, Steve Olson, told Reuters, “What we do today matters because it's going to influence how the rest of the month is going to pan out.”The broader industry impact is significant. Airline Reporting Corp. data showed that US air ticket sales through November fell 10% year-on-year, while major carriers such as American Airlines and Delta estimated daily revenue losses nearing $1 million during the shutdown’s early weeks. Analysts now expect those losses to surge.Daniel McKenzie of Seaport Research Partners said the 10% FAA-mandated cuts could cost airlines about $10 million a day, potentially ballooning to $45 million daily if restrictions extend through Thanksgiving.Budget carriers such as Frontier and Allegiant face steeper risks due to their limited flight frequencies, while larger airlines like American, Delta, and United could absorb some diverted traffic, McKenzie noted.While the FAA aims to restore full operations once government funding resumes, the exact recovery timeline remains uncertain — leaving airlines and passengers alike bracing for turbulence well into the holiday season.","Airlines had been counting on a rebound in corporate and leisure travel.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor ( CEA ) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country. CEA said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-105332515,imgsize-39018,width-400,resizemode-4/105332515.jpg"
E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran Udaan until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.Udaan built an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business still accounts for a very small part of India’s overall retail market but can balloon to $150 billion in sales and yield a 100% return on capital invested in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co. estimates published in the Mint newspaper.Bengaluru-based Udaan has also ventured into financing through its fintech unit which helps shopkeepers get working capital loans to buy inventory. That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says.

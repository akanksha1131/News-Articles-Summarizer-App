Stock market recommendations:Last week, the benchmark index Nifty began the week on a strong footing, supported by a series of positive macroeconomic and policy cues. The rally was largely attributed to S&P Global Ratings upgrading India’s sovereign outlook, which boosted investor sentiment around the country’s economic prospects.Additionally, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s announcement of next-generation GST reforms, expected to be implemented by Diwali, added further strength to the rally. These reforms are aimed at simplifying the tax regime and easing the burden on consumers and MSMEs, thereby fostering broader economic growth.The positive momentum continued through the week, pushing the index to a high of 25153 by Thursday. However, despite the strong upmove, Nifty was unable to decisively clear the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of the previous corrective move (from 25669 to 24337). This key resistance level led to profit-taking on Friday, resulting in the formation of a bearish candlestick with a long upper shadow, typically indicating selling pressure at higher levels.On the daily chart, the index has formed an Evening Star candlestick pattern, which is generally considered a bearish reversal signal. This, combined with the rejection at a crucial Fibonacci level, suggests that the bulls may be losing momentum, and a phase of consolidation or a corrective move could unfold unless fresh positive triggers emerge. Notably, during this pullback rally, the RSI failed to move past the 60 mark, indicating limited strength in momentum.Looking ahead, the 100-day EMA zone of 24650–24600 is expected to act as a key support area for the index. On the upside, the 25050–25100 zone will serve as a critical resistance. A decisive move beyond either of these levels could set the tone for the next directional trend in the index.Bank Nifty continued to underperform the broader market last week, reflecting ongoing weakness in banking stocks. After touching a weekly high of 56156, the index saw a sharp decline of over 1000 points, eventually closing at 55150, down 0.35% for the week. This decline led to the formation of a large bearish candle on the weekly chart, highlighting the dominance of sellers throughout the week.The relative weakness is also evident in the Bank Nifty/Nifty ratio, which has slipped to a 65-day low, underscoring the sector’s lag compared to the broader market. From a technical standpoint, the index is now trading below its 20-day and 50-day EMAs, both of which are trending downward — a sign of weakening short- to medium-term momentum.Adding to the cautious outlook, the daily RSI is nearing the 40 mark, indicating fading internal strength and increasing downside risk. Unless a strong reversal or positive trigger emerges, the index may remain under pressure in the near term.Looking at key levels, the 54900–54800 zone will act as immediate support. A sustained move below 54800 could open the door for further downside toward 54300, followed by the 200-day EMA at 53544. On the upside, the 55600–55700 zone will serve as a crucial resistance area for the index.The stock has broken out of a falling channel pattern last week, signalling a potential trend reversal. The breakout was accompanied by strong volume, lending credibility to the move. On the weekly chart, the stock has formed a sizeable bullish candle — its first significant positive close since May 2025, indicating renewed buying interest.Technically, the stock has also moved above its key moving averages on both the daily and weekly timeframes, reinforcing the bullish setup. Additionally, the daily RSI is hovering near the 60 mark, suggesting improving momentum. Overall, the combination of pattern breakout, volume confirmation, and improving momentum indicators points to a positive short-term outlook for the stock. Hence, we recommend to accumulate the stock in the zone of 466-462 level with a stoploss of Rs 445. On the upside, it is likely to test the level of 510 in the short term.Last week, the stock witnessed a breakout from a Stage-2 cup pattern on the daily chart, supported by robust volume, confirming strong buying interest. This breakout marks a significant technical development, especially as the stock is now trading near its all-time high, reflecting strong bullish sentiment.From a trend perspective, the stock is well-positioned above all its key moving averages on both the daily and weekly timeframes, indicating a well-established uptrend. Moreover, momentum indicators are aligned with the bullish view, with the RSI firmly in bullish territory across both timeframes, suggesting sustained strength and room for further upside.Given the combination of pattern breakout, volume confirmation, and strong momentum, the stock appears poised for continued outperformance in the near term. Hence, we recommend to accumulate the stock in the zone of 225-223 level with a stoploss of Rs 215. On the upside, it is likely to test the level of 250 in the short term.","According to Sudeep Shah, Head - Technical Research and Derivatives, SBI Securities, Apollo Tyres, and Nykaa are the top stock picks for this week.

Gold prices are likely to trade with a higher bias this week. Manav Modi, Senior Analyst, Commodity Research at Motilal Oswal Financial services Ltd shares his outlook on gold prices and strategy for gold investors:

Gold Stance: Sideways to higher

99,000 to 1,01,000, sustained moves above the same could take prices to all-time highs.

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market and other asset classes given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)

Gold price prediction today:Gold prices started last week on a lower note as easing of geopolitical tensions and shifting monetary policy expectations drove market sentiment. Some ease off was sparked by news that US tariffs on Swiss gold were reversed after the White House clarified the reports were false, leading to a retreat in prices. Meanwhile, optimism around a possible ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine, fueled by President Trump’s meetings with both leaders, weighed on the metal’s safe-haven appeal.Market participants were trading cautiously ahead of the Fed Chair Powell’s speech at the Jackson Hole symposium, where he struck a dovish tone, reinforcing expectations of a September rate cut. Governor Powell mentioned that there could be a possibility to change tracks from here as labour market could loosen from here, however he also talked about the tariff impact on inflation. Probability of a 25-bps cut slipped from 99% to 84% and then again above 90% after Jackson Hole supported bullion prices.This expectation slipped below 90% again over the weekend, capping some gains on the higher side. Meanwhile, President Trump added pressure by demanding Fed Governor Lisa Cook’s resignation and warning of potential sanctions on Russia.Domestically, USDINR volatility and a stronger dollar capped gold’s upside initially, while softer Chinese inflation data also dragged industrial metals lower.This week we have the economic calendar busy, with US consumer confidence, GDP and Inflation which could give further clarity and direction with respect to rate cuts and bullion moves. If we continue to see higher inflation and resilience in the economy, a rate cut could once again be a question mark. There could be some profit booking from the higher side, however, amidst the surprisingly dovish tone we could see continued upside momentum in Gold and Silver as market participants are pricing in rate cuts for the September meeting.","Manav Modi, Senior Analyst, Commodity Research at Motilal Oswal Financial services Ltd shares his outlook on gold prices and strategy for gold investors.

Online Gaming Bill 2025: Gaming regulation shake-up puts billions in VC investment at risk; investors to figure out ‘what can be done next’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/online-gaming-bill-2025-gaming-regulation-shake-up-puts-billions-in-vc-investment-at-risk-investors-to-figure-out-what-can-be-done-next/articleshow/123500416.cms,".

The central government’s ban on real-money gaming is creating challenges for venture capital investors, as startups valued at nearly $15 billion and having raised around $2 billion try to figure out their next steps.“We’ve made huge investments and are bound to face major capital losses… at this point though the efforts are towards finding out what can be done next,” a New Delhi-based venture capital investor, who has backed real-money companies, was quoted as saying by ET.“Real-money gaming companies, essentially, are consumer platforms with a large user base that can be leveraged for other offerings,” the investor said.WinZO, one of India’s top social gaming platforms, has removed all games affected by the new Online Gaming Regulation Bill, 2025. Following this, other major gaming companies have made similar moves. Dream11 has ended all paid contests to operate only as a free-to-play platform, and Games24x7 has halted real-money games on My11Circle.While Dream Sports, the parent company of India’s leading fantasy sports app Dream11, is piloting a wealth management product, WinZO Games is entering the US market and introducing micro-drama content.Dream11 has also informed the BCCI that it cannot continue as Team India’s title sponsor due to revenue losses, reported PTI.Global and domestic investors like Tiger Global, Z47, Think Investments, Peak XV Partners, and Malabar Investments have backed firms such as Dream Sports, MPL, Games24x7, and Zupee, all of which are now facing regulatory challenges.“These companies are going to be, not just for us, but for everyone, going to be very largely a write-off, because the business is shut effectively. They all have cash in the bank, because they made a lot of money,” Rehan Yar Khan, the managing partner of Orios Venture Partners, was quoted as saying by the Economic Times.“Since there was always a regulatory overhang over real money gaming, we took a very tiny experimental exposure. So, from the over Rs 2,000 crore that we manage, we invested only Rs 5 crore, that too across two funds in real money gaming,” he added.Nazara Technologies, the only publicly listed company exposed to real-money gaming, saw its market capitalization fall by Rs 2,164.9 crore last week following the government’s ban.Despite the challenges, some investors remain hopeful that the regulatory shakeout could spur innovation. “Most of the VC investors who have invested in gaming did not just come in for RMG. They believe in the long-term evolution of India’s gaming ecosystem. There are pivots and options these companies can explore, because gaming is still a very nascent industry in India,” one investor was quoted as saying by ET.Real-money games account for nearly 86 percent of India’s gaming revenue. The sector generates around Rs 31,000 crore annually, contributes Rs 20,000 crore in taxes, supports over two lakh jobs, and has drawn more than Rs 25,000 crore in foreign investment.In the Fiscal Year of 2023, Dream11 posted Rs 6,580.8 crore in revenue and Rs 443.6 crore profit, as cited by Tracxn, though its FY24 and FY25 results are pending. Games24x7 reported Rs 2,023 crore revenue with a Rs 199.6 crore loss in FY23, while Gameskraft earned Rs 3,521.4 crore revenue and Rs 947.8 crore profit in FY24, reported ET.","Real-money games account for nearly 86 percent of India’s gaming revenue.

Managing money across borders can be tricky for non-resident Indians (NRIs), especially since they are not allowed to open regular savings accounts in India. To meet their unique needs, banks offer two specialised options — the Non-Resident External (NRE) account and the Non-Resident Ordinary (NRO) account. While both accounts can be held simultaneously, their purpose and benefits differ significantly.An NRE account is primarily meant for NRIs looking to park their foreign earnings in India, while an NRO account is designed to manage income generated within India such as rent, dividends or business profits, according to an ET explainer.To make the choice clearer, here’s how the two compare on key parameters:The tax treatment and repatriation rules are often the deciding factors. For instance, the interest earned on an NRE account is tax-free under the Income Tax Act, 1961, and funds can be moved abroad freely without the need for a chartered accountant’s certificate. By contrast, income in an NRO account is taxable as per the account holder’s slab, and repatriation is capped.Both accounts can be opened by NRIs or Overseas Citizens of India (OCIs), either individually or jointly with another NRI/OCI or even a resident Indian, on an ‘either or survivor’ basis. Savings, current, fixed deposit, recurring deposit and term deposit formats are available under both categories.For NRIs, the choice ultimately depends on the source of income — foreign or Indian — and how much flexibility they need in moving money across borders.",An NRE account is primarily meant for NRIs looking to park their foreign earnings in India.

Bengaluru: The Qatar Investment Authority (QIA), through its subsidiary Qatar Holding, has approached the Karnataka high court to enforce an arbitral award of $235 million (about Rs 2,060 crore) against Byju Raveendran and his investment vehicle, Byju's Investments (BIPL).The claim includes interest of 4% per annum, compounding daily from Feb 28, 2024, which now adds up to more than $14 million (Rs 123 crore). The dispute stems from Sept 2022, when Qatar Holding extended $150 million in financing to BIPL. The loan, personally guaranteed by Raveendran, was used to fund the acquisition of over 17.8 million shares in Aakash Educational Services.The financing terms expressly barred the transfer of those shares, but the shares were later moved to another Singapore entity controlled by Raveendran, leading to the breakdown of the agreement.After repeated defaults, Qatar Holding demanded early repayment of $235 million. When BIPL and Raveendran failed to meet their obligations, the matter was taken to arbitration in Singapore in March 2024.An emergency arbitrator ordered a global freezing of assets up to the disputed amount, which was later confirmed by the Singapore high court. On July 14, the tribunal issued its final award, directing immediate payment of $235 million plus interest.The enforcement petition filed in Bengaluru on Aug 12 seeks recognition of the award as a decree of court, alongside an injunction against asset transfers and attachment of movable and immovable assets held by Raveendran and BIPL in India.The case marks the latest escalation in global legal proceedings involving the prominent education-technology founder. An email sent to Raveendran didn't elicit a response till the time of going to press.","The claim includes interest of 4% per annum, compounding daily from Feb 28, 2024.

Mumbai: Japanese retailer Uniqlo plans to double local sourcing from India, a market which it said is key to the brand's growth trajectory. Expanding local sourcing from the current 15%-16% to 30% in the coming years is the target, said Kenji Inoue, CFO and COO at Uniqlo India which is scouting for more local suppliers.The strategy fits in well with its widening retail play - a bigger business in the country will also allow it to source more locally. Uniqlo's revenues in India have topped Rs 1,000 crore in FY25 and profits have more than doubled during the period. This comes about six years since the retailer launched its first store in the country.""The target (30% sourcing) is always as soon as possible ...but it's not so easy to localise. We use certain technology in our products and we need to have a certain scale to make those particular products. We need to make our India business bigger to increase domestic sourcing...we aim to achieve 30% in coming years. This is our commitment,"" Inoue told TOI in an interview on Monday.Exports from India still account for a bigger share of Uniqlo's sourcing from the region at this point and even as tariffs roil global markets, India will remain an important global sourcing market for the company, Inoue said, without commenting on how much the brand sources from India for the US or what the sourcing strategy will be amid a looming 50% tariff deadline.""We are monitoring the (broader tariff) situation closely,"" Inoue said.As more Indians shop for Uniqlo's premium linen, T-shirts and heattech clothing, the brand is expanding its retail footprint in India by foraying into new markets Bengaluru and Pune. Localising its India portfolio (in terms of styles and colours) to cater to consumers better has helped the brand scale in the market where it competes with a mix of global retailers such as H&M, Zara, Levi's as well as local players and new-age D2C startups.With store expansion and a strong online play, Uniqlo hopes to touch Rs 3,000 crore in revenues in two to three years. India is yet not that big a market in terms of Uniqlo's global pecking order but is one of the top markets in terms of growth potential, Inoue said. ""India will play an important role in Uniqlo's global ambition of achieving 10 trillion yen in sales.""Uniqlo will focus on building upon its growth in existing markets in India rather than rushing to set up stores in every region. ""We are still small players in the market and have much space to grow,"" Inoue added.","Uniqlo's revenues in India have topped Rs 1,000 crore in FY25.

Ethanol-blended petrol push: Car experts warn E20 petrol may reduce fuel efficiency by 2 to 5 percent; warn of long-term erosion impact,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/ethanol-blended-petrol-push-car-experts-warn-e20-petrol-may-reduce-fuel-efficiency-by-2-to-5-percent-warn-of-long-term-erosion-impact/articleshow/123496104.cms,".

How leading automakers reacted



The adoption of 20 per cent ethanol-blended petrol (E20) could lead to a 2-5 per cent reduction in fuel efficiency, depending on the type of vehicle, according to automotive industry experts.India is fast-tracking its shift to E20 fuel, a mix of 20% ethanol and 80% petrol, aimed at lowering carbon emissions and reducing reliance on imported crude oil. The nationwide rollout, initially scheduled for 2030, has been moved up to 2025.Engineers associated with major automakers said older vehicles that are not E20-compliant may experience long-term wear in components such as gaskets, fuel hoses, and pipes, though these issues are not expected to appear immediately.""There can be a drop in mileage ranging from 2-5 per cent, depending on the type of vehicle. This is purely because of the lower calorific value of ethanol compared to petrol,"" an expert, who requested anonymity, was quoted as saying by PTI.Earlier this month, the Oil Ministry clarified that claims suggesting E20 causes a “drastic” reduction in fuel efficiency are misplaced. The ministry noted that E10 vehicles have shown only marginal efficiency drops, saying, “for some manufacturers, vehicles have been E20 compatible from as far back as 2009.The question of any drop in fuel efficiency in such vehicles does not arise.""The ministry highlighted that vehicles tuned for E20 deliver better acceleration, a key factor in city driving, and that ethanol’s higher heat of vaporisation reduces intake manifold temperatures, increasing air-fuel mixture density and boosting volumetric efficiency.""Ethanol, being lower in energy density than petrol, results in a marginal decrease in mileage, estimated at 1-2 per cent for four-wheelers designed for E10 and calibrated for E20, and around 3-6 per cent in others,” the ministry said through a post on X earlier this month.Several reports indicate that many motorists are concerned about E20 fuel’s potential impact on fuel efficiency.A Public Interest Litigation (PIL) was filed in the Supreme Court last week, challenging the nationwide rollout of 20% ethanol-blended petrol (E20). The plea, submitted by advocate Akshay, contends that millions of vehicles, including cars and two-wheelers made before 2023 and some newer BS-VI models, are not designed to run on high ethanol blends.When approached for comments, Maruti Suzuki and Hyundai Motor India declined, while a Tata Motors spokesperson confirmed that their vehicles are E20-compliant.""E20 usage will not have any impact on engines of compliant vehicles, as the materials are tuned for it. However, in vehicles, which are not E20 compatible, there could be erosion of gaskets and fuel rubber hoses and pipes in the long term, but not immediately,” another spokesperson was quoted as saying by PTI.The government has been promoting E20 blending as part of a national programme aimed at reducing emissions and boosting farmers’ income through ethanol production from sugarcane and maize.","India is fast-tracking its shift to E20 fuel, a mix of 20% ethanol and 80% petrol. The nationwide rollout, initially scheduled for 2030, has been moved up to 2025. Older vehicles that are not E20-compliant may experience long-term wear in components.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123496110,imgsize-1143252,width-400,resizemode-4/123496110.jpg"

'There will be more transactions': More Intel-like deals coming soon? What Donald Trump's aide said,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/there-will-be-more-transactions-more-intel-like-deals-coming-soon-what-donald-trumps-aide-said/articleshow/123507643.cms,"Donald Trump

After its deal with Intel, the US could be paving a new way to build wealth by investing in more private companies.US President Donald Trump’s top economic adviser, Kevin Hassett, said on Monday that more such investments may follow.Hassett, who heads the National Economic Council, told CNBC that Trump’s push for a sovereign wealth fund is part of the plan. “I'm sure that at some point there'll be more transactions” in the semiconductor industry or others, he said.The comments came after Washington agreed to take a 9.9% stake in Intel, valued at $8.9 billion. Under the deal, the US government will receive 433.3 million shares of common stock.The money comes in part from $5.7 billion in grants under the CHIPS and Science Act, a law passed during Joe Biden’s presidency but criticised by Trump, along with funding from another award.Hassett said that the shift marks a new approach.“In the past, the federal government has been giving money away,” he said. By contrast, under the Intel deal, “these are going to be shares that don't have voting rights.” He further added that the government does not intend to interfere in how companies are run.However, Intel flagged potential risks in a securities filing on Monday. The company warned that the government’s equity stake could reduce its chances of winning future grants and that uncertainties remain around the timing and conditions of funding.It also cautioned that its global business might be “adversely impacted” by the US government being a major shareholder.Critics fear that politics could start to drive business decisions, hurting the company’s prospects.The strategy is tied to Trump’s wider vision. In February, soon after returning to the White House, his administration unveiled plans to establish a sovereign wealth fund for the world’s largest economy. Such funds, common in resource-rich nations, use state reserves to secure long-term financial returns.For now, Hassett described the Intel case as exceptional. He said that it came out of “a very, very special circumstance because of the massive amount of CHIPS act spending that was coming Intel's way,” he explained.","US President Donald Trump's top economic adviser, Kevin Hassett, said on Monday that more such investments may follow.

NEW DELHI: Food chain McDonalds is reducing the cost of its combo meals in the United States after growing criticism that its menu has become too expensive, according to a report from the Wall Street Journal.The fast-food chain and its franchisees have agreed to lower prices on eight popular combo meals by about 15 percent compared with buying the items separately, sources familiar with the plan told WSJ. McDonald’s will provide financial support to franchisees that participate in the price cuts. The lower rates will take effect from next month.The chain will also expand its value offerings with a $5 breakfast deal and an $8 Big Mac and McNugget combo, reviving its “Extra Value Meals” branding in the coming months. McDonald’s declined to comment on the reports.McDonald’s CEO Chris Kempczinski acknowledged earlier this month that “consumers’ value perceptions are most influenced by our core menu pricing.” He admitted that “value-minded consumers are too often seeing combination meals that cost more than $10 and that is shaping value perceptions in a negative way.” He added: “The single biggest driver of what shapes a consumer’s overall perception of McDonald’s value is the menu board.And it’s when they drive up to the restaurant and they see the menu board, that’s the number one driver. We’ve got to get that fixed.”The pricing move comes amid rising inflationary pressures and changing consumer perceptions. Following the pandemic, McDonald’s was increasingly seen as a pricey alternative rather than a cheap fast-food option, with some customers comparing its rates to sit-down chains like Applebee’s or Chili’s. In 2023, an $18 Big Mac combo at a rest stop went viral, fuelling debate over affordability and prompting the president of McDonald’s USA to clarify that such high prices were “an exception. ”Despite the backlash, promotions such as last year’s $5 meal deal and themed tie-ins, including a “Minecraft Movie” Happy Meal, helped stabilise sales and lift the company out of two straight quarters of declining performance. Reuters reported that McDonald’s beat Wall Street estimates for second-quarter global comparable sales earlier this month, driven in part by affordable bundles.The latest price cuts come as restaurants across the US struggle to retain diners affected by inflation and economic uncertainty. Analysts note that McDonald’s push to restore its affordability image stands in contrast to other large corporations that have raised prices, often citing tariffs and rising costs.While McDonald’s looks to regain its affordability image, other corporations are still raising prices, citing the impact of President Donald Trump’s tariffs. The Wall Street Journal reported that “restaurants, particularly fast-food chains, are struggling to attract customers worn down by inflation and unsure about the US economy.”Sony recently raised the price of its PlayStation 5 console by $50 in the US, while Microsoft and Nintendo also increased prices for their gaming devices and accessories. Home Depot, Procter & Gamble, and Walmart have announced price hikes linked to tariff-related costs, with Walmart’s CFO John David Rainey telling CNBC that “tariff-impacted costs are continuing to drift upwards.”Small businesses, with less flexibility, are also passing costs onto consumers. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warned that “some companies will certainly be taking advantage” of tariffs to raise prices even when not directly affected — similar to how firms hiked costs during the pandemic.Meanwhile, electricity prices are rising at twice the rate of inflation, and housing remains unaffordable for millions. Analysts note that Trump’s repeated promises to bring down prices have not materialised, contributing to his declining approval ratings on economic issues.Washington Post columnist Heather Long described the situation as a “K-shaped economy,” where wealthier households now account for half of all consumer spending. With companies targeting affluent consumers, many businesses are opting to raise prices instead of broadening their customer base.Democrats, sensing voter frustration, have increasingly campaigned on lowering the cost of living. However, economists warn that reversing tariffs alone will not solve inflationary struggles, leaving pressure on policymakers to deliver immediate relief.",Fast-food chain and its franchisees have agreed to lower prices on eight popular combo meals by about 15 percent.

And the next step is really — yes, it is disruption. It is instability, if not worse.”Since returning to office in January, Trump has repeatedly demanded that the Fed lower rates to ease borrowing costs and accelerate growth. With Powell holding policy steady for months, the president has openly sought to weaken his standing in an effort to hasten his exit.Powell’s term runs until 2026, and a US president cannot remove a Fed chair without cause. Yet Trump has widened his campaign by targeting other members of the Federal Reserve Board. He has sought to appoint allies aligned with his economic vision and recently called for the resignation of Fed governor Lisa Cook, accusing her of falsifying documents to obtain a mortgage.Lagarde’s warning, delivered on a network popular with Trump’s conservative base, underscores growing international concern that political pressure on the Fed could spill into broader economic risk.","Christine Lagarde says undermining central bank independence could unleash ""dysfunction"" and ""instability"" Her remarks come at a time when President Donald Trump is intensifying pressure on the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates.

US-EU trade deal adds to shipping costs

New Delhi cites regulatory uncertainty

European postal services are suspending shipments to the United States after Washington announced the end of the long-standing “de minimis” tariff exemption, sparking confusion over new customs rules and duties.The de minimis exemption, which currently allows packages worth less than $800 to enter the US duty-free, will expire Friday. According to the US customs and border protection agency, 1.36 billion packages worth $64.6 billion were shipped under this rule in 2024.On Saturday, postal operators in Germany, Denmark, Sweden, and Italy said they would stop sending most merchandise to the US immediately. France and Austria will follow on Monday, while the UK’s Royal Mail will halt shipments on Tuesday. Royal Mail said items worth over $100, including personal gifts, will now face a 10% import duty.DHL, Europe’s largest shipping provider, said: “Key questions remain unresolved, particularly regarding how and by whom customs duties will be collected in the future, what additional data will be required, and how the data transmission to the US Customs and Border Protection will be carried out.” The company added it will no longer accept parcels from business customers bound for the US.Poste Italiane said, as quoted by ET, “In the absence of different instructions from US authorities ... Poste Italiane will be forced, like other European postal operators, to temporarily suspend acceptance of all shipments containing goods destined for the United States, starting August 23.” It added that DHL Express and other private couriers remain an option.In the Nordics, PostNord called the suspension “unfortunate but necessary.” In the Netherlands, PostNL spokesperson Wout Witteveen said the US is pressing ahead without a system to collect duties. “If you have something to send to America, you should do it today,” he told the Associated Press.Austria’s Austrian Post said the last commercial shipments to the US, including Puerto Rico, will be accepted Tuesday. France’s La Poste also announced a halt, saying the US did not provide time for postal operators to prepare.The move follows a new US-EU trade framework, which sets a 15% tariff on most products shipped from Europe, including packages under the $800 threshold. The US had already ended duty-free exemptions for goods from China in May, according to ET.PostEurop, an association of 51 European postal operators, warned that unless a solution is found by August 29, all members may suspend shipments to the US.This comes as India announced a temporary suspension of most international postal services to the US, effective August 25, 2025, in response to the regulatory changes.In a government statement, New Delhi said the move follows Executive Order No. 14324, issued by the US administration on July 30, 2025, which formally withdraws the de minimis exemption for goods valued up to $800.","European postal services are suspending shipments to the United States after Washington announced the end of the long-standing “de minimis” tariff exemption.

Nikki Haley Warns Donald Trump of ‘Strategic Disaster’ as 50% US Tariff on India Nears Deadline

US president Donald Trump ’s sweeping tariff hikes on imports could shrink the US deficit by $4 trillion over the next decade, the Congressional budget office (CBO) said on Friday.According to CBO, Congress’ nonpartisan analyst, higher tariff revenue would reduce primary deficits by $3.3 trillion and trim federal interest payments by $0.7 trillion. The new estimate marks a sharp increase from June, when CBO forecast a $2.5 trillion reduction in primary deficits and a $500 billion drop in interest costs.The revenue boost could help offset the effects of the Republicans’ tax-cut and spending package passed earlier this year, which CBO said will widen the deficit by $3.4 trillion over 10 years.The US federal debt stands at $37.18 trillion, treasury department data shows, and continues to climb under both Republican and Democratic administrations as spending outpaces revenue. Lawmakers must pass new spending bills by the end of September to avoid a government shutdown according to Reuters.CBO has cautioned that the current top tariff rates may not last, with trade negotiations and international legal challenges still in play.Tariffs across countries and products averaged 16.7% in August, up from 15.1% in June, according to Oxford Economics.

'Sovereign Brazil’



Exporters get BNDES support







Brazil’s state development bank, BNDES, on Friday announced a 10 billion reais ($1.85 billion) credit line to help companies affected by steep US tariffs. The facility is divided into funding for general operating expenses and exploring new export markets, complementing a 30 billion reais package unveiled earlier this month by the Brazilian government.According to BNDES, companies of all sizes with products subject to any level of US levies can access the credit line, reported Reuters.The move follows the government’s broader 30 billion reais ($5.5 billion) support plan, aimed at exporters impacted by the 50% tariffs imposed by US president Donald Trump on several Brazilian goods.Other measures in the government’s plan, dubbed “Sovereign Brazil,” include postponing tax charges, providing 5 billion reais ($930,000) in tax credits to small and medium-sized enterprises through 2026, and expanding insurance coverage for cancelled orders. The program also encourages public procurement of goods that cannot be exported to the US, providing an alternative market for affected companies.Brazilian president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva emphasised the need for calm and innovation during economic crises. “We cannot be scared, nervous and anxious when there is a crisis. A crisis is for us to create new things,” he said. “In this case, what is unpleasant is that the reasons given to impose sanctions against Brazil do not exist.”The US tariffs have been linked by Trump to the judicial situation of former president Jair Bolsonaro, who is currently under house arrest, adding a political dimension to the trade dispute.The combined credit lines from BNDES and the federal government aim to provide Brazilian companies with liquidity, flexibility, and opportunities to explore alternative markets, helping them offset the impact of US tariffs.","Brazil's state development bank, BNDES, announces 10 billion reais ($1.85 billion) credit line to help companies affected by steep US tariffs.

'Thug' Indian Truck Driver Crash In Florida Sparks US Visa Freeze, Triggers Illegal Immigration Row

At present, ‘Driving under influence’ (DUI) offences, especially if they are low-level, do not automatically lead to deportation from or inadmissibility into the US, however a bill that has been passed by the House in end-July and is garnering support at the Senate level could change the scenario. Understandably, it is causing jitters among the immigrant community - including the Indian diaspora.Joseph Tsang, immigration attorney, posted on a social media platform, “A DUI could get green card holders deported, even from ten years ago! If it becomes law, anyone who is not a US citizen – be they green card holders, international students or H-1B workers could become inadmissible and deportable for having a DUI on record.”The Office of Management and Budget (attached to the White House) has officially expressed its backing of this bill - H.R. 875 or the Protect Our Communities from DUIs Act.It has been referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee and according to immigration experts, support for this bill in its current form, is growing.Tsang strongly agrees that DUI is serious as it takes lives, it causes pain... “The intent is to make our communities safer and that is a goal we all share,” but he adds, “The core issue here is proportionality and process.This bill skips context. It skips rehabilitation. It skips due process.”A single low-level DUI from a decade ago, where no one was hurt could abruptly end an immigrant’s American dream. He illustrates: A green card holder who has a DUI from years ago on his record takes a short trip overseas. The bill is passed while he is not in the US. When the individual tries to return, he is inadmissible and cannot enter US. There is no hearing, no warning, no path forward.Landerholm Immigration, a law firm, in its alert states, “One of the most alarming parts of this bill is that you don’t even need a conviction to be targeted. If you’ve ever admitted to drinking and driving, that alone could make you inadmissible to the US. Even if the charges were dropped. Even if you took a plea. Even if it happened many years ago. This is an extremely broad and harsh standard.”“The bill turns nearly every DUI case (even a single offense) into a serious immigration issue – be it for green card holders, for undocumented immigrants, for those applying for a visa or adjustment of status, those returning from travel abroad,” adds the alert.Immigration attorneys are strongly urging those holding a green card and eligible for citizenship to begin the process immediately. They are also cautioning individuals who have a DUI on their record to approach attorneys and build up a strong defence.","A bill that has been passed by the House and is garnering support at the Senate level could change the scenario.

The United States government has acquired a 10 per cent holding in Intel, marking one of the most striking federal interventions in a private company since the 2008 auto bailouts.US President Donald Trump announced the agreement on Friday, describing the deal as “a great partnership for America and for Intel.”According to filings and statements, the US is obtaining 433.3 million shares of the Silicon Valley chipmaker, issued at $20.47 apiece, well below Friday’s closing price of $24.80.On paper, the government begins with a $1.9 billion gain, as reported by the news agency AP.The $8.9 billion equity purchase is being funded through previously pledged CHIPS Act grants, together with an additional $3.2 billion from the Secure Enclave programme. When added to earlier payments, the total government commitment rises to $11.1 billion.Although the stake makes the US one of Intel’s largest shareholders, it carries no voting rights or board representation, a point Intel emphasised in its own statement. The company’s chief executive, Lip-Bu Tan, welcomed the move, saying Intel remained “deeply committed to ensuring the world’s most advanced technologies are American made”, as per AFP.“We are grateful for the confidence the President and the Administration have placed in Intel, and we look forward to working to advance US technology and manufacturing leadership”, he added.The deal unfolded rapidly. Just weeks ago, Trump had urged Tan to step down over concerns about his past investments in Chinese firms. But after the Malaysian-born executive pledged loyalty to the US in a letter to employees and met with the president at the White House, the tone shifted, as per AP.By mid-August, discussions had advanced to the point where, according to the New York Times, Trump pressed Intel to part with a tenth of its equity.Commerce secretary Howard Lutnick hailed the arrangement as “historic,” arguing that it converted what had been Biden-era subsidies into “equity for the American people.”Intel shares rose more than six per cent following the announcement.Still, critics have sounded alarms. As per AP, Scott Lincicome of the Cato Institute warned the move was “a horrendous decision” that risks entangling politics with commercial choices.Tech analyst Rob Enderle called it a “slippery slope” toward nationalisation, as quoted by news agency AFP.Some investors, like Nancy Tengler of Laffer Tengler Investments, questioned whether taxpayers would see any return, warning of government meddling in corporate strategy.The intervention comes as Intel battles to recover from $22 billion in losses since 2023, large-scale layoffs, and missed opportunities in the smartphone and AI revolutions. While once a Silicon Valley titan, its $108 billion valuation is now dwarfed by Nvidia’s $4.3 trillion market capitalisation.Whether the government’s stake will help turn the company around, or simply raise new concerns about political interference, remains uncertain.As Ben Bajarin of Creative Strategies was quoted as saying by the New York Times, “Once the government becomes a stakeholder, the question is: what will they do to protect their investment?”","US President Donald Trump announced the agreement on Friday.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas.

How India's GDP has been growing

What SBI report said on savings and investment

Incremental capital output ratio

NEW DELHI: India's gross domestic product (GDP) data for the third quarter (October-December 2022) received a word of caution from the former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan In an interview with news agency PTI, Rajan that India is ""dangerously close"" to the Hindu rate of growth in view of subdued private sector investment, high interest rates and slowing global growth.India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying"".However, a report released by the State Bank of India (SBI) economists on Tuesday dismissed arguments that India is dangerously close to Hindu rate of growth saying such statements are ""ill-conceived, biased and premature"".The term 'Hindu growth rate' was coined by late economist Raj Krishna in 1978 to describe the slow growth in the country.It basically refers to the low pace of economic growth rates during 1950s to 1980s. During this period, the Indian economy averaged 3.5%.A former lecturer at the Delhi School of Economics (DSE), Krishna noted that only if the rate of growth is persistently slow and accompanied by low per-capita GDP, then it will be known as Hindu rate of growth but it has to factor in population growth as well.Before economic reforms of 1991, India's economic growth remained stagnant and low, while per capita income averaged around 1.3%. Krishna termed this low growth situation to be a result of socialist policies of state control and import substitution.However, the economic situation changed when liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation (LPG) reforms came into effect in the year 1991, at a time when India faced balance of payment crisis.Over the years, many economists have strongly opposed the idea of 'Hindu growth rate' and the term never had universal acceptance.The Indian economy plunged into its very first technical recession in FY21 due to the impact of Covid-19 pandemic and the related nationwide lockdowns. GDP shrunk by an unprecedented 23.8% in the first quarter of the financial year 2020-21. However, due to spurt in economic activities in the subsequent quarters, the GDP decline started to narrow.However, if we look at the period before Covid-19 as well, India's growth curve shows a declining trend.From 8.26% in FY17, GDP growth plunged to 3.74% in FY20. Shutdown of economic activities in FY21 in wake of Covid-19 only made matters worse.As lockdowns started to ease and business activities resumed, India's GDP also started rising. In Q1 of FY22, growth jumped to 20.1% mainly on account of low base effect. By the fourth quarter of FY22, growth came down to 4.10%.Similarly, the new financial year 2022-23 brought fresh economic challenges in the form of Russia-Ukraine war that impacted almost all major economies of the world, slowed the pace of growth, pushed inflation to record highs.As a result, the central banks of all advanced economies spurred into action and opted for monetary policy tightening to curb the soaring inflation.With persistently rising interest rates, India's economy grew by 4.4% in Q3 of FY23, as the Centre revised upwards GDP growth for previous year to 9.10% from 8.7% earlier.The report weighed recent GDP numbers against the available data on savings and investments for the past decade and highlighted some interesting points.""Quarterly growth numbers are noisy and should be best avoided for any serious interpretation (on an average, India's GDP growth has witnessed Rs 2 lakh crore upward revision for the 3 year ended FY23),"" the report said.Gross capital formation (GCF) by the government touched a high of 11.8% in 2021-22, up from 10.7% in 2020-21.""This also had a domino effect on private sector investment that jumped from 10 per cent to 10.8% over the same period,"" it said.In fact, Ecowrap added that the trends in GCF to gross output ratio or the plough back of funds for creation of fresh capacity shows that for public administration the ratio attained fresh peak in 2021-22 owing to the emphasis on capital expenditure in recent budgets.At the aggregate level, gross capital formation is supposed to have crossed 32% in 2022-23, the highest level since 2018-19.According to the report, in 2021-22, gross savings have risen to 30% from 29% in 2020-21.""The ratio is supposed to have crossed 31 per cent in 2022-23, the highest since 2018-19. The household savings increased sharply during the pandemic period on account of sharp accretion in financial savings such as deposits,"" said the report by SBI's Economic Research Department.While household financial savings have since then moderated from 15.4% in 2020-21 to 11.1% in 2022-23, savings in physical assets have grown sharply to 11.8% in 2021-22 from 10.7% in 2020-21.The report further analysed Incremental Capital Output ratio (ICOR) -- which measures additional units of capital (investment) needed to produce additional units of output. It said that the ratio has been improving.""ICOR which was 7.5 in FY 12 is now only 3.5 in FY22. Clearly, only half of capital is now needed for next unit of output,"" the report noted.Such reducing ICOR in the current years reflects a relatively increasing efficiency of capital and shows that the economy is on a sound footing, the report said.""From that point of view, future GDP growth rates even at 7% could still mean a decent number by any standards!,"" it added.","India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.

An employee is entitled for a 50 per cent amount of the last drawn salary as pension.OPS was discontinued by the NDA government in 2003 with effect from April 1, 2004.Under the new pension scheme (NPS), employees contribute 10 per cent of their basic salary towards pension while the government contributes 14 per cent.Governments of Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand have informed the central government/ Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA about their decision to restart OPS for their employees.The government of Punjab on November 18, 2022, issued a notification regarding implementation of OPS for the state government employees who are being covered under NPS.

The meeting was chaired by Food Secretary Sanjeev Chopra.Out of the total wheat procurement target for the 2022-23 marketing year (April-March), Punjab will aim to procure 2.5 million tonnes wheat, Haryana 1.5 million tonnes and Madhya Pradrsh 2 million tonnes, the food ministry said in a statement.Wheat procurement had declined last year due to a fall in domestic production and higher exports.However, the government has projected a record wheat production at 112.18 million tonnes in the 2023-24 crop year (July-June) as per the second estimate of the agriculture ministry.Besides wheat, the government has also fixed rabi (winter) rice procurement target at 10.6 million tonnes in the 2022-23 marketing year.States have been advised to enhance rice milling capacity so that milling of one season gets completed before the commencement of next season and recycling of rice may be avoided.Whereas procurement of millets and coarse grains is estimated to be 7,50,000 tonnes this year, higher than 6,30,000 tonnes in 2021-22. Karnataka will procure 6,00,000 tonnes of millets this year, the statement added.Separately addressing the conference, food minister Piyush Goyal urged all state governments to implement smart-PDS at the earliest.He lauded Andhra Pradesh government's Command Control and stated that the central government will work together for implementing it in other states also.On the storage front, the Union minister said FCI is upgrading godowns into five-star rated ones and state governments can also upgrade their godowns.In the conference, all the state governments were told to learn from the best practice of using millets in schemes like mid-day meal and PDS in Karnataka, which is helpful in adding nutrition and promoting healthy diet.States were encouraged to procure more millets and coarse grains. All the state governments were asked to open procurement centres for coarse grains in producing districts, especially, in tribal areas. State governments were asked to encourage consumption of coarse grains as well.The conference also deliberated on fighting anaemia and nutritional deficiencies in various parts of the country by suitably creating awareness on benefits of fortified rice.The issues related to smart Public Distribution System (PDS) and One Nation One Ration Card scheme for seamless delivery of foodgrains to migrant beneficiaries were also discussed.FCI (Food Corporation of India) is the government's nodal agency that undertakes procurement and distribution of foodgrains for the PDS and welfare schemes.The best practice of command control centre by Andhra Pradesh for real time data on procurement, storage, quality and distribution of foodgrains was also discussed, for which all states have been urged to learn and adopt the methods to make their systems effective and efficient.Further, implementation of additional minimum threshold parameters for online procurement operations, i.e. integration of power validation of milled rice quantity with electricity consumption and tracking of vehicles used for transporting food grains were also deliberated upon for improving efficiency and transparency in procurement operations.During the discussion, it emerged that sufficient jute bags are available as per requirement of ensuing season.

What is TrumpRx? Donald Trump announces new website to offer discounted drug prices; savings expected to reach 50%,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/what-is-trumprx-donald-trump-announces-new-website-to-offer-discounted-drug-prices-savings-expected-to-reach-50/articleshow/124246331.cms,"AP file photo





US president Donald Trump on Tuesday announced the launch of a new federal website, TrumpRx.gov, as part of a deal with Pfizer to offer prescription drugs directly to consumers at discounted prices. The initiative, aimed at cutting healthcare costs, is expected to grow with more deals from other drugmakers in the coming months.The new website is part of a broader push to align US drug prices with those in other developed nations, a strategy known as “most-favored-nation” pricing. Under the deal, Pfizer agreed to offer the same prices for new drugs in both the US and other advanced markets.“The United States is done subsidizing the health care of the rest of the world,” Trump said in a press conference. ""They put all of that on us, and yet they were the beneficiaries too. So it's been changed.""A senior administration official said Tuesday that the TrumpRx site, set to launch in early 2026, will not directly sell or distribute medications. Instead, consumers will be able to search for their prescriptions and be redirected to drugmakers’ direct-to-consumer platforms, as cited by CNN.Pfizer said most of its primary care drugs will be offered through TrumpRx, though it did not specify which ones.The company also announced plans to invest an additional $70 billion (£52 billion) in US manufacturing, research, and development.""We now have the certainty and stability we need on two critical fronts, tariffs and pricing,” Pfizer’s chief executive, Albert Bourla, said, as reported by the BBC.According to a company press release, direct-to-consumer prices for Pfizer drugs on TrumpRx.gov will average 50 percent lower. However, key details on how those discounts were determined were not provided. “Specific terms of the agreement remain confidential,” the release stateThe administration on Tuesday clarified that “Most Favored Nation” pricing is based on a drug’s net price, including discounts and rebates, compared with the lowest price in other wealthy countries such as Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK, Switzerland, and Denmark. This lowest international price then serves as the benchmark for US pricing.Pfizer, the first drugmaker to fully meet the demands outlined in Trump’s July letter to industry CEOs, plans to offer Medicaid “Most Favored Nation” pricing starting in early 2026, with the president indicating other companies may follow.Trump has often highlighted that Americans pay significantly more for prescription drugs than people in other developed nations, especially in Europe, where governments frequently set prices. A Health and Human Services report last year found US drug prices to be nearly three times higher than in comparable countries. During his first term, Trump unsuccessfully pushed for a “Most Favored Nation” pricing policy to address the gap.","Donald Trump on Tuesday announced the launch of a new federal website, TrumpRx.gov, as part of a deal with Pfizer to offer prescription drugs directly to consumers at discounted prices.

Gold price prediction today: Will stellar gold rally run continue in the near term? Here’s the outlook,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gold-price-prediction-today-india-where-is-gold-silver-rate-headed-on-october-01-2025-mcx-gold-futures-outlook/articleshow/124238129.cms,"Gold is still poised to continue its bull run as it may test a level $ 3,950 – 4,000 per oz in spot markets by the end of 2025. (AI image)

Gold Price Outlook:

Weekly View: Volatile week ahead for precious metals

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market and other asset classes given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)





Gold price prediction today: Gold and silver prices are poised for a long-term bull run, though there may be short term volatility due to global factors, says Maneesh Sharma, AVP - Commodities & Currencies, Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers. He shares his views and recommendations for gold and silver investors:Gold continued to shine bright at the start of the current week, climbing past $3,800 per oz for the first time ever in Spot markets. The Yellow metal printed yet another all-time high near $3,871 in Spot on Tuesday after spending much of last week consolidating just below the previous all-time high near $3,791. This was due to positive momentum which returned following the release of the US Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) inflation report. While the data came in broadly as expected, bets remain elevated that the US Fed might continue easing its rates in the upcoming meeting in October favoring sentiments in Gold & Silver.Meanwhile in the current week the US faces the risk of a government shutdown effective 1st October unless Congress agrees on new funding legislation. Republican leaders in the House pushed a stopgap bill to extend funding through November 21, but Senate Democrats have refused to back it without policy concessions.The dollar had suffered from rising risk of a US government shutdown and falling oil prices since the weekend, with safe haven currencies like yen emerging as the top performer. President Trump had already stated that a shutdown is now likely after little progress on congressional negotiations. In case of a shutdown, a lower Yen may well remain the favourite trade as history shows it lost 1.5% during the 2018-19 shutdown.Finally, focus also remains on US data due later in the week, with the closely monitored JOLTS report due on Tuesday followed by Payrolls on Friday. An upside surprise in US payrolls may bring in volatility in prices, but data might also be delayed due to the risk of shutdown. An extended shutdown may also result in profit booking moves in global equities leading to risk of a near term correction in prices especially in Silver complex.Brace for high volatility in bullion prices especially in silver, on a weekly basis as markets witness a data heavy week along with US shutdown risk to persist in the current week. The department of labor had said that the release of economic data, including Non farm payrolls would be suspended if a US shutdown takes place, which could again bring back safe haven appeal in gold on medium term basis.Any major corrective move in global equities in case of US shutdown in near term, needs to be watched out which could limit upside especially in silver prices. This is due the fact that silver had already witnessed a run up of up to 50 % in prices since 21st of April, the day where Gold hit an all time peak, while gold prices are up only 12 – 13 % since then.Again Gold/Silver ratio which has declined to almost 80 levels on Friday (in International Spot markets) from a high of 107 hit on 21st April is now poised to bounce back in near term to 84 – 85 levels indicating Silver may witness more downside moves as compared to Gold in near term.However from a medium to long term perspective, Gold is still poised to continue its bull run as it may test a level $ 3,950 – 4,000 per oz in spot markets by the end of 2025 or by the start of next year. Long term bias in Silver prices also remains positive as a breach of all-time highs in International markets (hit in Apr 2011 around $ 49.60) could be witnessed by the start of next year.","Gold and silver prices are poised for a long-term bull run, says Maneesh Sharma, AVP - Commodities & Currencies, Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers.

NEW DELHI: A senior executive from Dutch semiconductor machinery company ASML has said that EU is inaccessible to European companies, while it is getting time and patient hearing from the Indian govt.Speaking at a ‘Competitive Europe summit in Brussels’, organised by digital platform Politico, Frank Heemskerk, executive VP of global public affairs at ASML, said it is difficult to get sufficient access to top European policymakers, such as Commission President Ursula von der Leyen: “It’s not always easy” He further added, “It’s easier to get a meeting with a senior official in the White House than to get a meeting with a commissioner. ”The Politico reported that the comment came after Heemskerk said ASML’s CEO Christophe Fouquet had a two-hour meeting with PM Modi. “After an hour-and-a-half of listening, he (Modi) said you’re too friendly, tell me what we can do better,” Heemskerk said, adding that European policymakers would do well to take note of such exchanges. “The political leaders should sit down with the companies that are investing money. ”","Senior executive from Dutch semiconductor machinery company ASML has said that EU is inaccessible to European companies.

BENGALURU: Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is under scrutiny as lawmakers in both the US and UK press CEO K Krithivasan for answers regarding the company’s employment practices and cybersecurity protocols. US Senators Charles E Grassley and Richard J Durbin from the senate judiciary committee wrote to TCS CEO K Krithivasan, raising concerns about the company’s hiring practices.The senators said that while TCS laid off around 60 employees at its Jacksonville office, it continues to file large numbers of H-1B visa applications. In the 2025 fiscal, TCS received approval for 5,505 H-1B visas, making it the second-largest employer of newly approved H-1B beneficiaries in the US. The senators asked TCS to clarify whether it prioritises hiring foreign workers over qualified Americans during a period of layoffs.“TCS is already under investigation by the Equal Opportunity Employment Commission for allegedly firing older American workers in favour of newly hired South Asian H-1B employees. TCS is doing itself no favours by replacing Americans with H-1Bs during this investigation,” the letter read.TCS is also facing questions from UK Labour MP Liam Byrne, who wrote to Krithivasan demanding answers about the company’s role in recent cyber incidents at Jaguar Land Rover, Marks & Spencer (M&S), and Co-op.In his letter dated Sept 26, Byrne highlighted BBC reports that the M&S breach was triggered by a ransomware email “sent apparently using the account of an employee from TCS.”","US Senators Charles E Grassley and Richard J Durbin wrote to TCS CEO K Krithivasan.

Govt’s electronics parts manufacturing drive sees 1.1L crore proposals,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/govts-electronics-parts-manufacturing-drive-sees-1-1l-crore-proposals/articleshow/124280469.cms,"Electronics and IT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw

Has Scope To Create Incremental Production Of 10.3L Cr





NEW DELHI: Govt’s efforts to deepen the Indian component ecosystem for electronics has received a massive boost, with domestic and international companies putting in applications for investing over Rs 1.1 lakh crore in new projects, almost twice to the original target. This has the potential to result in creating incremental production to the tune of Rs 10.3 lakh crore, when fully realised.Govt has made it clear that there are no special provisions for getting investors from China and said the “law of the land is well-known” when dealing with investment proposals from countries that share land border with India. Currently, such investment applications are dealt under the Press Note 3 (PN3) provision that was introduced in April 2020. “The process related to such applications is well established,” Electronics and IT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said when asked specifically on investments from Chinese companies.The minister said the plan is to make India self-sufficient when it comes to supply chain for components, which can cater to various manufacturing industries. Once built, this supply chain will also look at global markets. “Swadeshi (indigenous) electronics components will position Bharat as a global supplier,” Vaishnaw said.A whole host of companies have applied under the scheme and these are believed to include global giants, such as Foxconn and Flex.On the local side, companies such as Tata, Dixon, Amber and Optiemus are understood to have filed applications.Vaishnaw said against an original incremental production target of Rs 4.6 lakh crore through the scheme, which promises benefits of Rs 22,805 crore, the current number of applications (at 249) can scale this up to Rs 10.3 lakh crore. The minister said around 60% of the applications are by Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises (MSMEs), which would ensure that the supply chain is deep-rooted and exhaustive.The single-biggest investment proposal that the scheme has received is to the tune of Rs 22,000 crore, the minister said, adding that govt will vet the proposals swiftly so that projects can begin faster.The category of ‘enclosures for mobile, IT hardware products &related devices’ has received 16 proposals worth Rs 35,813 crore, while ‘flexible printed circuit board’ and related segment has got 11 proposals worth Rs 16,542 crore. The ‘electro-mechanicals’ category has got 87 applications worth Rs 14,362 crore, and multi-layer PCB has seen 43 applications worth Rs 14,150 crore.Vaishnaw said many categories have received proposals for the first time. He added that govt has asked companies to pursue original design work within India to create local IPs. Sunil Vachani, chairman of Dixon, said the scheme will ensure that current value additions in mobile phones and IT hardware products will jump substantially, which will make India-made products globally competitive.","The plan is to make India self-sufficient when it comes to supply chain for components.

IPO Activity Slow In US, But There’s Spate Of Startups Going Public In India: Peak XV’s MD





MUMBAI: India’s capital markets have been resilient, defying global slowdown on the back of robust support from domestic investors, allowing a spate of startups to go public. This has been “the single biggest” positive development for all private market investors, said Shailendra Singh, MD at Peak XV Partners. This is the first time India’s capital markets are strong enough to “decouple” from the US markets and stand on their own, Singh told TOI in an interview.The blue-chip venture capital firm that split from its Silicon Valley parent Sequoia Capital in 2023 as part of a global restructuring has backed several Indian unicorns, three of which — Pine Labs, Meesho and Groww — are headed for a Dalal Street debut in the current financial year.“VCs invest for an 8-10 years’ time horizon... if you invest for 8-9 years but there is no liquidity, there’s a big problem (VCs need to deliver returns to limited partners on their investments). India has really stood out in the last 3-4 years because globally, there has been a downturn. IPO activity, even in the US has been completely meagre for three consecutive years. During that time, you had in India thriving capital markets.If high-scale companies with high quality governance are able to go public, have liquidity... this completes the loop for investors (gives them an exit),” Singh said.“To us, it feels like the capital markets liquidity is an enduring liquidity, not a transient blip because there are enough domestic institutions that are big participants in India’s capital markets. The fact that there is domestic source of strength, not foreign money, makes the market more resilient,” Singh said.While a resilient capital market would nudge more startups to go public in India, not every company should be public and founders need to be careful, said Singh.“If a lot of sub-scale companies go public, there could be windows of illiquidity even in public markets subsequently. It’s much worse to be a small public company than a small private company if you are not in a bull cycle,” Singh said. In all, six of Peak XV’s portfolio firms in India have currently filed for IPO and more would be tapping the public markets, Singh said, without sharing details.For Peak XV Partners, after the split with Sequoia, values driving the company haven’t really changed much although there has been some shift in the investing strategy. The partners want to build Peak XV into a world class global firm anchored in India and APAC.. As it looks to be a global player, the company has set up a team in the US to help Peak expand in the market and scout for opportunities in software and AI, which Singh said is on a “super cycle globally. ”In India, the firm will continue to bet on consumer, fintech, software and AI sectors. Peak XV is not having “FOMO” about quick commerce but sees other promising bets in the consumer space — consumer AI, for instance, could grow as a space in India in the coming years, Singh said.In India, a lot of startups are coming up in the AI application space and there has been a “big” pick up in seed stage funding in AI firms, he said.","India’s capital markets have been resilient, defying global slowdown on the back of robust support from domestic investors.

JP Morgan has an outperform rating on Dixon Technologies with a target price of Rs 19,500. Analysts said the stock has lost around 10% in the last three trading sessions, but they don’t see any fundamental reason behind this fall. They recommended investors to buy this dip for a high-quality earnings compounder over the next three years. While growth will be driven by mobiles over FY25-27, after that, they believe, growth can be supported by non-mobile as it scales up refrigerators, washing machines, IT hardware, telecom and lighting. Analysts also said that the joker in pack is the component manufacturing foray through three entities - JV with HKC, acquisition of Q Tech India, and JV with Chongqing Yuhai. They also believe the catalysts for the stock over the next six months are govt approval on JV with HKC, and updates, if any, on potential renewal of production linked incentive (PLI) scheme for mobiles that is ending in Mar 2026.Jefferies has a buy on CMS Info Systems with the target price cut to Rs 445. Analysts said the management pointed at softer trends for FY26 and normalisation from FY27. Yet, growth in core revenues may be moderate around 12% compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) over FY25-FY30 and margins stable.They feel an uptick in ATM network expansion will be key for the company and in the retail cash segment, the management plans to keep up with aggressive share gains. They also feel tech & payment solutions to see stronger growth. The company may evaluate M&A prospects.Morgan Stanley has an overweight rating on Shriram Finance with the target price at Rs 785. Analysts said that the company has clarified that talks about a potential majority stake sale was unfounded and the company categorically denied any knowledge about such a stake sale. They said April-June (Q1FY26) asset quality was better than feared. Yet, sentiment is clouded by macro factors. Analysts said the stock is looking attractively valued at the current level.CLSA has an underperform rating on Nazara Technologies with the target price at Rs 166. Analysts said that the govt’s new online gaming law has barred all online money games from Oct 1. Fantasy sports, rummy and poker gaming companies were already reeling under 28% GST. However, the govt will continue to promote esports and other online games. In Jan 2025 Nazara paid Rs 800 crore to acquire a 46% stake in PokerBaazi. And the company will take a hit in PokerBaazi, and its ownership in fast-growing e-sports subsidiary Nodwin has fallen below 50%. In Q1FY26, Nodwin had accounted for 70% of Nazara’s e-sports revenue, which was up 17% on the year. Analysts feel Nazara’s stock valuation is expensive at current levels.UBS initiated its coverage of Vikram Solar with a neutral rating and the target price at Rs 355. Analysts feel the solar sector would see strong growth ahead while backward integration remains the key. The company is likely to see integration benefits likely from FY28, but limited opportunity thereafter. Its backward integration to be funded by debt. The company’s ambitious capex presents a balanced risk-reward proposition. The key risks include capex/cell ramp-up delay and weaker-than-expected domestic solar demand.","JP Morgan has an outperform rating on Dixon Technologies with a target price of Rs 19,500.

BENGALURU: American tech firm Natsoft and its subsidiary Updraft have sued Mumbai-based Hexaware Technologies in the US for $500 million for patent infringement.The plaintiffs allege that Hexaware’s flagship modernization platforms — RapidX, Amaze, and Tensai/ATOP — illegally incorporate Natsoft’s patented technologies covering automated code testing, business-rule extraction, code generation, and legacy modernisation.Plaintiffs alleged that Hexaware misused confidential information and technology shared during their partnership to build its own competing platforms, the court filing reviewed by TOI showed. Natsoft alleged that Hexaware wrongfully benefited from their technology without paying licensing fees. Natsoft said that it invested $100 million.“Based on our assessment, the company believes that the complaint is without any merit and is unlikely to result in an adverse order and, accordingly, does not expect the same to have any material financial impact on the company,” Hexaware said in a filing on Thursday.","American tech firm Natsoft and its subsidiary Updraft have sued Mumbai-based Hexaware Technologies in the US for $500 million for patent infringement.

MUMBAI: Less than one out of 10 households in India (9.5%) invest in securities market-related financial products like stocks and mutual funds, a Sebi survey showed.

Berkshire Hathaway to acquire OxyChem for $9.7 billion: Last major deal under Warren Buffett's leadership? What we know,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/berkshire-hathaway-to-acquire-oxychem-for-9-7-billion-last-major-deal-under-warren-buffetts-leadership-what-we-know/articleshow/124275479.cms,"



Warren Buffett-owned Berkshire Hathaway is set to acquire Occidental Petroleum’s chemical division, OxyChem, for $9.7 billion, marking possibly the last major deal under the billionaire investor who owns the firm, set to retire by year-end.Notably, Buffett's name was absent from Thursday's announcement materials, as reported by Associated Press, suggesting a transition of leadership to Vice Chair Greg Abel, who will become CEO in January.Although Buffett will retain his position as chairman at Berkshire and continue to influence decisions regarding the company's substantial cash reserves exceeding $344 billion.The conglomerate's cash has accumulated as Buffett struggled to identify attractively priced major acquisitions since purchasing Alleghany Insurance for $11.6 billion in 2022. Increased competition from hedge funds has driven acquisition prices higher.OxyChem produces essential chemicals including chlorine for water treatment, vinyl chloride for plastics and calcium chloride for road de-icing. The business will complement Berkshire's existing chemical subsidiary, Lubrizol, acquired in 2011 for $9 billion.""Berkshire is acquiring a robust portfolio of operating assets, supported by an accomplished team,"" Abel said in a prepared statement.""We look forward to welcoming OxyChem as an operating subsidiary within Berkshire,"" he further said as quoted by AP.OxyChem's pretax earnings fell to $213 million in the second quarter, compared to nearly $300 million previously. Occidental has been divesting Permian Basin assets, generating $950 million for debt reduction. Following the December 2023 CrownRock acquisition, Occidental has sold approximately $4 billion in assets to address $7.5 billion in debt.Occidental plans to utilise $6.5 billion from the Berkshire transaction to reduce debt below their $15 billion target, established after the CrownRock acquisition.Prior to this deal, Berkshire owned over 28% of Occidental's stock, with warrants for an additional 83,911,942.38 shares at $59.586 each. Additionally, Berkshire held $8.5 billion in preferred Occidental shares from 2019, earning 8% annual dividends.While Buffett previously committed to maintaining Occidental stakes and continued purchasing shares, he informed shareholders in 2023 that complete acquisition wasn't planned.Berkshire's diverse portfolio includes insurance companies like Geico, BNSF railway, utilities, and renowned brands such as Dairy Queen and See's Candy, built over 60 years. The company also maintains stock holdings exceeding $250 billion, including significant investments in Apple, Coca-Cola, Bank of America and American Express.The OxyChem transaction is scheduled to conclude in the fourth quarter of this year.","Berkshire Hathaway set to acquire Occidental Petroleum's chemical division, OxyChem, for $9.7 billion.

The S&P 500 and Nasdaq indices reached unprecedented levels when markets opened on Thursday, driven by fresh optimism regarding potential interest rate reductions, whilst investors prepare for minimal economic data releases as the week concludes.At market opening, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 20.0 points, representing a 0.04% increase, reaching 46,461.11. The S&P 500 advanced by 20.1 points or 0.30%, opening at 6,731.31, and the Nasdaq Composite climbed 130.7 points, equivalent to 0.57%, touching 22,885.905 at the start of trading.Technology stocks surged again following OpenAI’s announcement of partnerships with South Korean firms for its Stargate AI infrastructure project. Additionally, Nvidia rose 1.7 percent at the start of trading, while other tech firms remained in focus due to broader AI-related optimism. Tesla shares also climbed 1.6 percent after reporting a 7 percent increase in third-quarter sales.Stock indexes also climbed across Europe and Asia, while Treasury yields remained relatively steady after a US government shutdown delayed the weekly unemployment claims report. The US government went on a formal shutdown on October 1 after Republicans and Democrats failed to reach an agreement on federal fundingMeanwhile, Wall Street is hoping the US job market slows just enough to persuade the Federal Reserve to continue cutting interest rates—but not so much that it triggers a recession.Striking this balance is tricky, and delays in government economic reports add to the uncertainty. With stocks already hitting record highs on expectations of rate cuts, any sign that the cuts may not materialize could push the market lower.Investors currently expect nearly a 99 percent chance of a Fed rate cut later this month and an 87 percent chance of another cut in December.Wednesday’s ADP report showed the US private sector shed jobs in September, contrary to expectations of growth. Analysts said the weak data strengthens the case for Fed rate cuts in the coming months, though a partial government shutdown has delayed key economic reports, adding uncertainty.“The data emboldens calls for the Fed to ease rates in the months ahead,” said Joshua Mahony, chief market analyst at Scope Markets, as quoted by AFP.","The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 20.0 points, representing a 0.04% increase, reaching 46,461.11.

EU steel tariffs: European Commission plans higher duties; aim to protect local producers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/eu-steel-tariffs-european-commission-plans-higher-duties-aim-to-protect-local-producers/articleshow/124270888.cms,"EU Envoy Urges Both Sides to Engage in Earnest Efforts to Meet India-EU FTA Year-End Target





The European Union is preparing to increase tariffs on steel imports as part of a push to protect local producers from cheap Asian steel and new trade barriers from the United States.The European Commission is expected to unveil a permanent plan next week, which will also slash the EU’s existing steel quotas for foreign steel by nearly 50%, EU industry chief Stephane Sejourne said, according to a source cited by Bloomberg.Under the new system, imports above the reduced quotas will face higher tariffs, similar to the US, which currently charges a 50% duty on imported steel.At present, the EU operates a temporary safeguard that imposes a 25% tariff once quotas are exceeded. That arrangement is due to expire next year, prompting the Commission to design a more lasting solution to replace it.The move comes as EU leaders meet in Copenhagen to discuss boosting the bloc’s defence capabilities.“Our reality today and tomorrow is security and security means armaments and armaments means steel,” Polish PM Donald Tusk said.“We have to protect our companies, our steel companies in Europe and in Poland,” Bloomberg quoted Tusk as saying.Europe’s steel industry has been under pressure for years from cheap imports from China and other Asian countries, which was further intensified by the US raising steel and aluminium tariffs to 50% shortly after Donald Trump took office.Sejourne added that while the EU supports free international trade, “we will not be the only ones to impose on ourselves the principles that others no longer apply,” according to someone familiar with his remarks.The proposal coincides with discussions on stricter EU climate targets for 2040, which could add further strain on energy-intensive industries such as steel, according to Bloomberg.Europe’s steel body, Eurofer, has called for stricter measures to match changing market conditions and urged a full post-2026 trade framework to tackle the harmful impact of global steel overcapacity on the EU market.“This is the first real measure to support our sector, and support quality jobs in Europe,” said director general Axel Eggert. “But there needs to be more.”","The European Commission is expected to unveil a permanent plan next week.

South Korea and the United States have reached a preliminary agreement on security, as both countries continue to negotiate trade and tariff issues, according to Yonhap news agency.In an interview published on Thursday, South Korean foreign minister Cho Hyun said that the US is currently reviewing a currency swap deal, a key demand from Seoul in the tariff discussions. However, the minister also hinted that it was not optimistic.Washington had agreed to cut tariffs on South Korean imports in return for a $350 billion investment package. However, talks on the details, including how the investments will be structured, have stalled.Though Cho said that the negotiations were ""actively"" ongoing, South Korea may take longer than Japan to finalise a deal. Japan finalised its investment package last month.Meanwhile, security discussions are advancing in parallel as the two nations continue to explore measures such as boosting South Korea’s defence spending, which is part of the broader plan aimed at reducing US tariffs, Reuters reported. Cho said the aim was to announce the security agreement before the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in Gyeongju in late October, which US President Donald Trump is expected to attend.Trump said South Korea should shoulder more of its military costs and pay more for US troops stationed there. Responding to this, South Korean President Lee Jae Myung on Wednesday announced that the country will increase its defence budget by 8.2% next year, highlighting the need for stronger self-defence.""In the security field, an agreement has already been reached in general, which allows us to increase our national defence capabilities in necessary areas,"" Cho told Yonhap.Officials also said progress is being made on granting South Korea more rights to process nuclear fuel for industrial use, a move currently restricted under existing agreements.Cho did not dismiss the possibility of a meeting between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, as some ""speculative"" reports cited by Reuters suggested.Last month, North Korea said it would consider negotiations if the US stopped insisting on the complete denuclearisation of the country.","South Korea and the United States have reached a preliminary agreement on security, as both countries continue to negotiate trade and tariff issues.

Tesla owner Elon Musk has set a new record, becoming the first person ever to build a fortune of almost $500 billion. The surge comes on the back of a rebound in Tesla’s stock and soaring valuations of his other ventures, including SpaceX and xAI.Forbes’ billionaires index put Musk’s net worth at $500.1 billion as of 4:15 PM ET on Wednesday. Much of that wealth is tied to Tesla, where he holds more than a 12.4% stake, Reuters reported.The electric carmaker’s stock has climbed over 14% this year and rose 3.3% on Wednesday alone, adding more than $6 billion to his fortune.Tesla shares have bounced back after a shaky start to the year, with investors encouraged by Musk’s renewed attention to his companies. Tesla chair Robyn Denholm noted last month that Musk was now back “front and center” at the firm after several months spent at the White House.Musk showed his commitment days later by buying about $1 billion worth of Tesla shares, a move seen as a strong show of faith in the company’s future as it pushes beyond cars towards AI and robotics.Still, challenges remain. Weak car sales and pressure on profit margins have left Tesla lagging behind its peers in the so-called “Magnificent Seven” group of tech giants.Even so, the company’s board has proposed a $1 trillion pay package for Musk, tying the deal to ambitious growth and operational goals while also addressing his demands for a larger stake, according to Reuters.Beyond Tesla, Musk’s other firms have been on the rise. His AI startup xAI was last valued at $75 billion in July, according to Pitchbook.Earlier in September, CNBC reported that it could seek a $200 billion valuation in future fundraising, though Musk insisted it was not raising money at the time. His rocket company SpaceX has also been in talks to sell insider shares, with Bloomberg reporting a potential valuation of around $400 billion.Oracle founder Larry Ellison trails Musk as the world’s second-richest person, with a fortune estimated at $350.7 billion as of Wednesday.","Elon Musk is the first person ever to build a fortune of almost $500 billion.

The US private sector lost 32,000 jobs in September, according to payroll processor ADP, defying analysts’ expectations of employment growth. The biggest losses came in leisure and hospitality, professional services, and financial activities, AFP reported.Hiring also contracted in trade, transportation and utilities, along with manufacturing, the report showed.“Despite the strong economic growth we saw in the second quarter, this month's release further validates what we've been seeing in the labor market, that US employers have been cautious with hiring,” said ADP chief economist Nela Richardson in a statement.Salaries rose 4.5 percent year-on-year, a rate that ADP said was “little changed.” Pay gains for job-switchers slowed to 6.6 percent in September from 7.1 percent in August.ADP noted that the monthly reduction reflected an annual preliminary adjustment of its figures based on 2024 results from the quarterly census of employment and wages. After this benchmarking, September’s job losses came to 43,000.The report comes as US policymakers watch the labour market closely. The Federal Reserve cut interest rates for the first time this year in September amid employment concerns. Economists have cautioned, however, that ADP figures often diverge from official government data.","US private sector lost 32,000 jobs in September, according to payroll processor ADP.

One noted that their business remains “severely depressed” due to US President Donald Trump’s “extreme” tariffs. Firms dependent on imports for raw materials were particularly affected.“Tariffs continue to drive additional spend,” said a respondent from a petroleum and coal products company.

With the US government shutdown in effect, Friday’s official employment report may be delayed, increasing uncertainty in markets.“Whether this is an accurate statistic or not, people in the markets believe that it signals something,” said Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics.“The signal from today’s headline will not be a good one.”Wall Street has been hoping for a controlled slowdown in the job market—enough to encourage the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates without triggering a recession.

What happened during the last shutdown?



(With inputs from agencies)





The United States plunged into a government shutdown on Wednesday after President Donald Trump and Congress failed to pass a funding bill, leaving hundreds of thousands of federal workers furloughed and numerous services suspended. Roughly 750,000 federal employees will be taking unpaid leave each day, with a total daily cost estimated at $400 million (£297 million), according to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO).Trump, speaking at the White House before the deadline, acknowledged the looming closure. “We don't want it to shut down,” he said, but private talks with congressional leaders yielded no compromise to avert a shutdown. This marks the third federal funding lapse overseen by Trump, highlighting a deeply polarised political climate in Washington that rewards hardline positions over traditional compromise.“This is more than a political tussle shutdowns inflict economic cost, fear and confusion across the country,” said Rachel Snyderman, former White House budget official and managing director of economic policy at the Bipartisan Policy Centre.US futures fell following the shutdown, with the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average down 0.6%, while the Nasdaq ticked slightly higher. Global markets reacted cautiously: Germany’s DAX and France’s CAC 40 slipped, while Britain’s FTSE rose modestly.The government’s monthly jobs report, due on Friday, may also be delayed, further increasing economic uncertainty. Previous shutdowns have disrupted data collection and federal reporting, affecting decision-making by businesses and investors. Airline operations, while considered “essential,” may face delays as air traffic controllers and TSA staff often call in sick during extended closures, as seen in the 2018–19 shutdown.During that 35-day shutdown the longest in US history the economy lost an estimated $3 billion in GDP. Approximately 300,000 federal workers were furloughed, with delayed payments for those deemed essential. Disruptions affected air travel, law enforcement, Coast Guard families, and food safety inspections, demonstrating the far-reaching consequences of a prolonged funding lapse.Some programmes, such as Medicare, Medicaid, and the Pentagon, continue to operate, though staffing shortages may cause delays. Trump has indicated that services favoured by Democrats could be cut as part of the administration’s broader effort to reduce federal employment. Smithsonian museums are staying open temporarily, while national parks face potential closure amid safety concerns.Federal law enforcement and border protection personnel continue working, often without pay. TSA officers and air traffic controllers remain on duty, though previous shutdowns revealed that understaffing and fatigue can compromise efficiency and safety. Government websites and agencies have also faced operational risks; security certificates for more than 80 official websites, including the Department of Justice and NASA, have expired during previous funding gaps.Members of Congress continue to receive their salaries, as required by the U.S. Constitution. Military personnel are required to work but will only be paid retroactively. The CBO notes that daily costs will fluctuate depending on the number of furloughed employees, but even a short shutdown can delay billions in federal spending, suspend purchases of goods and services, and disrupt critical programmes.Unlike past funding lapses, the Trump administration appears willing to sustain a prolonged shutdown, using it as a tool to identify “non-essential” employees for permanent removal. “We'll be laying off a lot of people,” Trump said before the deadline. This aggressive approach contrasts with earlier shutdowns, which were typically seen as politically risky and economically disruptive enough to prompt rapid resolution.The 2018–19 shutdown, caused by a standoff over border wall funding, illustrated the human and economic toll: Coast Guard families relied on food pantries, the FBI faced strained resources, and the FDA suspended most inspections, raising public safety concerns. Once resolved, federal operations largely returned to normal, but this time, the administration’s ongoing efforts to cut spending and reduce personnel may extend the disruption and magnify its costs.The standoff also has political ramifications. Democrats are pushing for health care subsidies under the Affordable Care Act, while Republicans and the White House resist linking negotiations on spending to ongoing government operations. Failure to reach a compromise threatens both domestic services and broader economic stability, with investors, employees, and businesses left in uncertainty.","The United States plunged into a government shutdown on Wednesday after President Donald Trump and Congress failed to pass a funding bill. Roughly 750,000 federal employees will be taking unpaid leave each day, with a total daily cost estimated at $400 million. This marks the third federal funding lapse overseen by Trump, highlighting a deeply polarised political climate in Washington.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124256474,imgsize-1720311,width-400,resizemode-4/ai-image-generated-using-chatgpt.jpg"

‘Not An Annual Fee’: White House Issues Clarification Amid Confusion Over H-1B Visa Fee Order

What is China’s K Visa?

So who qualifies for China's K visa?

International graduates holding bachelor's or higher degrees in STEM disciplines from prestigious universities or research centres globally or within the country (additional information about qualifying institutions forthcoming);

Young foreign professionals currently working in education and research roles within STEM-related domains.

And what are the benefits of K visa?

Length of residency: Offers enhanced flexibility regarding entry frequency and validity duration compared to standard visa categories currently available.

Permitted activities: Includes participation in educational, scientific, technological, cultural, entrepreneurial and commercial collaborative endeavours.

Entry criteria: Eliminates requirement for local company sponsorship, focusing instead on applicant's age, academic qualifications, or professional experience as determining factors.

Is China’s K visa the counter to Trump’s H-1B visa crackdown?

China K visa : The challenges

China’s K visa programme implementation faces several obstacles. The Chinese authorities have specified unclear requirements relating to ""age, educational background and work experience"".

The policy lacks transparency regarding monetary benefits, job placement support, long-term residency options and provisions for bringing family members.

China rarely grants citizenship to foreign nationals, unlike US immigration policies.

The predominant use of Mandarin in Chinese technology companies creates significant obstacles for professionals who don't speak the language.





China’s newly introduced K visa category, which is effective from October 1, 2025, is widely being seen as a counter (though not official!) to the Donald Trump administration’s crackdown on the H-1B visa programme. At a time when the US is imposing stricter immigration policies, China is clearly signalling an intent to ‘welcome’ global talent.The newly introduced K visa, announced in August, aims to attract young international STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) graduates by offering entry, residency and work authorization without requiring any prior work offer.Although China has abundant local engineering expertise, the K visa initiative forms part of Beijing's strategy to present itself as welcoming to international investment and skilled professionals, especially as US trade restrictions create uncertainty in China's economic landscape.The Trump administration recently hiked the H-1B visa application fee to $100,000, a move that sent shockwaves globally, and especially in the Indian IT sector which is a big beneficiary of this particular visa programme. The US is also looking to do away with the current H-1B visa lottery system, replacing it with a weighted system for visa allotment.In this backdrop, China’s K visa could potentially strengthen its position against the US in their geopolitical competition. What is China’s K visa, what are its application criteria, benefits, and challenges? We take a look:According to a KPMG analysis, China established the R visa for highly skilled professionals in 2013, but the introduction of the K visa specifically aims to attract foreign youth talent in science and technology fields.K visa holders will benefit from increased flexibility in managing their activities within China, facilitating broader scientific and technological cultural exchange programmes, says KPMG.China’s K visa could present an attractive option for overseas professionals seeking alternatives to US employment opportunities. Several countries, including South Korea, Germany and New Zealand, are implementing more accessible visa regulations to draw skilled migrants.Beijing has implemented various policies to encourage foreign investment and travel, including expanding access for international investors across multiple sectors and removing visa requirements for nationals from most European nations, Japan, South Korea and others.""The symbolism is powerful: while the US raises barriers, China is lowering them,"" notes Iowa-based immigration attorney Matt Mauntel-Medici according to a Reuters report.The Trump administration's recent announcement of a $100,000 annual fee requirement for H-1B worker visas, commonly utilised by technology firms for skilled foreign recruitment, has created new opportunities. ""The US has definitely shot itself in the foot on H-1Bs, and the timing is exquisite for China's K visa,"" noted Michael Feller, chief strategist at Geopolitical Strategy.Immigration specialists highlight that the K visa's primary advantage lies in eliminating the need for employer sponsorship, traditionally a significant obstacle for H-1B applicants.The H-1B programme's current structure requires company sponsorship and operates through a lottery system limited to 85,000 positions annually, with the newly proposed fee potentially discouraging first-time applicants.""It's an appealing alternative for Indian STEM professionals seeking flexible, streamlined visa options,"" Bikash Kali Das, an Indian student at Sichuan University told Reuters. Indians represented the largest group of H-1B recipients last year, comprising 71% of successful applicants.The diplomatic friction between India and China might restrict the intake of Indian professionals under the K visa programme, experts told Reuters.""China will need to ensure Indian citizens feel welcome and can do meaningful work without Mandarin,"" said Feller.China has historically concentrated its talent acquisition efforts on scientists of Chinese origin residing overseas and individuals of Chinese descent abroad.Substantial incentives, including housing allowances and welcome bonuses reaching 5 million yuan ($702,200), have successfully attracted Chinese STEM professionals from the United States, particularly as Washington intensifies its scrutiny of China-linked activities.""The recruitment effort targeting Indian tech talent in China is growing but remains moderate compared to the more intensive, well-established, and well-funded initiatives aimed at repatriating Chinese STEM talent,"" said Sichuan University's Das.A Chinese STEM graduate, who recently received employment offers from Silicon Valley, expressed doubts about the K visa programme's effectiveness.""Asian countries like China don't rely on immigration and local Chinese governments have many ways to attract domestic talent,"" he told Reuters.The United States hosts 51 million immigrants, comprising 15% of its population, whilst China accommodates merely 1 million foreigners, representing less than 1% of its residents.Whilst China is not expected to implement substantial changes to its immigration policies to accommodate millions of foreign workers, experts suggest the K visa could enhance Beijing's position in its technological competition with the US.""If China can attract even a sliver of global tech talent, it will be more competitive in cutting-edge technology,"" Feller said.","The newly introduced K visa, announced in August, aims to attract young international STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) graduates.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor (CEA) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran Udaan until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.Udaan built an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business still accounts for a very small part of India’s overall retail market but can balloon to $150 billion in sales and yield a 100% return on capital invested in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co. estimates published in the Mint newspaper.Bengaluru-based Udaan has also ventured into financing through its fintech unit which helps shopkeepers get working capital loans to buy inventory. That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says.

SAR imagery provides much higher resolution than other forms of remote sensing technology such as hyperspectral and multispectral. SAR is a critical technology for strategic reconnaissance and planning as well as for disaster management.According to Misra, winning the challenge in just over a year of floating the company is a major booster.He said L and P band SAR have an advantage over other frequencies (like X band) when it comes to penetration capabilities through rain, clouds, foliage and vegetation in a tropical country like India, and underground penetration capabilities in dry terrain.Continuing further, he said the L band SAR will provide 1 metre resolution, spotlight resolution in Stripmap mode. The current industry standard is 5-10 metre in L band. Misra said both the L and P band will operate simultaneously from a satellite borne SAR. Recently, Sisir Radar successfully developed and tested the world’s highest resolution L-Band SAR fitted on a drone. With 0.2 metre resolution, this is by far the highest L band SAR in the world, he said.","Space sector startup, Sisir Radar Private Ltd has hit success at the prestigious iDEX DefSpace Challenge.

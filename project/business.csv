Asian stocks mixed as tech-led Wall Street rebound offsets tariff anxieties,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/asian-stocks-mixed-as-tech-led-wall-street-rebound-offsets-tariff-anxieties/articleshow/121584272.cms,"Asian equities opened on a cautious note Tuesday, as a rebound in US tech stocks offered modest optimism while investors continued to watch ongoing trade war developments and geopolitical risks.A regional index fluctuated between small gains and losses, and US equity-index futures dipped 0.2% after the S&P 500 rose 0.4% on Monday—buoyed by technology shares at the beginning of what is typically a subdued month for markets. Meanwhile, bonds held steady in early Asia trading, and the dollar remained flat after touching its lowest level since 2023 in the previous session.Oil extended its gains, while gold remained steady following its largest daily jump in four weeks.Investor focus has shifted to trade headlines after the US on Monday extended Section 301 tariff exclusions on some Chinese imports until August 31. The Trump administration has asked countries to submit their “best offer” on trade talks by Wednesday, Reuters reported. Efforts are also underway to arrange a call between Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping amid renewed accusations from both sides of breaching a prior trade truce.“We continue to expect market volatility as investors digest fresh tariff headlines and incoming US economic data,” said Ulrike Hoffmann-Burchardi of UBS Global Wealth Management. “Fiscal worries remain, and geopolitical tensions are heating up.”Although Trump has pushed for direct talks with Xi, the Chinese president has so far preferred negotiations via advisors. Their last known conversation occurred in January, before Trump’s inauguration. White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett suggested on Sunday that a call could happen this week.“The markets keep shrugging off simmering trade war risks,” said Kyle Rodda, senior market analyst at Capital.com. “While it has slipped down the list of priorities for market participants, below trade policy, fiscal policy and macroeconomic data, a very solid set of quarterly results from mega cap tech is enticing investors into the market.”Japan’s domestic focus on Tuesday will be on a fresh round of government bond auctions. The finance ministry is set to sell ¥2.6 trillion ($18 billion) in 10-year notes, following weak demand at auctions last month that raised concerns over public borrowing plans.On Monday, Asian equities tumbled after US President Donald Trump escalated trade tensions by doubling tariffs on steel and aluminium to 50%, accusing China of violating a recent trade truce. “China has totally violated the agreement,” Trump said, referring to a 90-day pause agreed last month. US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick also accused China of “slow-rolling” negotiations.China dismissed the claims as “seriously contrary to the facts” and criticised Washington’s “bogus charges.” The renewed tension revived fears of a full-blown trade war, overshadowing positive inflation data from the US.Markets across Hong Kong, Tokyo, Sydney, Singapore, Taipei, Manila and Jakarta registered declines. Hong Kong’s losses surpassed 2%, led by property stocks amid concerns over New World Development’s delayed bond payments and a broader credit crunch in China’s real estate sector.Oil surged after OPEC’s modest production increase disappointed markets, while escalating Ukraine-Russia hostilities added to the anxiety. The US dollar weakened amid fears about fiscal sustainability as Trump pushed for extended tax cuts and welfare reforms.Moody’s downgraded the US’s last top-tier credit rating, citing ballooning deficits. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon cautioned that the US bond market could be heading for a crisis. “The bond market is going to have a tough time. I don't know if it's six months or six years,” he said.(With inputs from Bloomberg report)",US equity-index futures dipped 0.2% after the S&P 500 rose 0.4% on Monday.

"What is EB-5 visa?

EB-5 visa demand

US President Donald Trump’s mounting restrictions on student visas, has many Indians presently in the US and prospective college applicants considering the EB-5 visa route. This visa scheme offers a route to permanent residency or Green Card for foreign investors who contribute $800,000 (approximately Rs 7 crore).Global universities' international student communities are facing growing challenges due to administrative and political disputes, as noted by specialists in the field. In the past, international students in the US could secure their stay through status modifications that allowed them to work and travel within the country.Immigration lawyers have witnessed a doubling of EB-5 applications from Indian students during the last four to five months of Donald Trump's second presidential term.The current US administration's less welcoming stance towards international students has prompted those aged 19-24, particularly in sought-after disciplines such as computer science, biotech and finance, to increasingly pursue EB-5 visas.The annual quota for this category is restricted, with India allocated roughly 700 visas. Given that the US remains the preferred destination for higher education, with 86,000 Indians enrolled in 2024, experts anticipate intense competition for EB-5 visas this year.""There is a sharp jump in EB-5 applications,"" Rajneesh Pathak, founder of Global North Residency and Citizenship, an immigration law firm, told ET.

""They are willing to invest in EB-5 to secure the future of their children,"" said Pathak.Recent developments contributing to widespread concern include the suspension of new F-1 visa appointments, conflict between the Trump administration and Harvard University, stricter F-1 visa regulations, intensive review of students' documentation including social media activity, SEVIS system technical issues, and enhanced scrutiny at entry points.""The F-1 visa, once as a bridge to opportunity, now feels like a tightrope,"" said Akshat Gupta, head of India & UAE, US Immigration Fund (USIF), an EB-5 Regional Centre operator.Since January, USIF has witnessed a 100% increase in F-1 visa holders applying for EB-5 visas compared to 2024.US legal practice Chugh LLP reports a significant increase in EB-5 applications from Indian students holding F-1 visas.Also Read | ‘Sergey Brins of the world came as students..’: Raghuram Rajan warns about risks to US economy if foreign students are curbed by Trump ""Roughly one-third of my new immigration consultations now involve students worried about how US politics could affect their status,"" said Navneet S Chugh, attorney, who runs the firm. The firm's EB-5 enquiries from students have risen from one or two quarterly last year to five to seven monthly this spring.""The Harvard dispute simply reminds them how quickly rules can change,"" said another lawyer.Davies and Associates, a US-based immigration law firm, reports substantial enquiries from Indian students and H-1B visa holders interested in pursuing the EB-5 visa pathway.The processing duration for I-526E applications has reduced considerably compared to previous periods.""In some instances, what once took three years is now being processed in as little as three months,"" said its founder and chairman, Mark Davies. He noted that applicants maintain the freedom to reside and work in the US whilst their Green Card applications are under review.According to Sukanya Raman, country head at Davies and Associates, Green Card holders receive legal safeguards unavailable to F-1 visa students.

US President Donald Trump and China's counterpart Xi Jinping are likely to speak this week, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Monday, following the tension that flared between the two economic powerhouses over breaching tariff and trade restriction agreements.Responding to the reporter's query, Leavitt said, ""I can confirm that the two leaders will likely talk this week."" ""And as always, when foreign leaders call, we will provide a readout of those calls,"" she added, as per ABC News report.Treasury secretary Scott Bessent indicated on CBS' ""Face the Nation"" that a discussion between Trump and Xi would occur ""very soon"" to address trade matters, including disputes over critical minerals and Chinese export limitations.Trump expressed confidence about speaking with Xi on Friday, while Chinese officials noted in April that no recent communications had occurred between the leaders.The US trade representative's office extended tariff exclusions for certain solar manufacturing equipment and other Chinese products until August 31, providing additional time for ongoing Beijing negotiations.Bessent, who led Geneva negotiations resulting in a temporary trade war cessation between the world's largest economies, acknowledged to Fox News that progress has been limited since then, Reuters reported.The US-China agreement to reduce triple-digit tariffs for 90 days sparked significant gains in global markets, though it failed to address core U.S. concerns about China's state-controlled, export-focused economic structure.A US trade court determined on Wednesday that Trump exceeded his authority in implementing most tariffs on Chinese and other imports under emergency powers. However, a federal appeals court swiftly restored the tariffs the following day, temporarily suspending the trade court's decision pending government appeal. The court set response deadlines of June 5 for plaintiffs and June 9 for the administration.","US President Donald Trump and China's counterpart Xi Jinping are likely to speak this week.

When we look at critical minerals, which are key for energy transition, but also key for defense, AI, manufacturing, chips, we are seeing a major concentration.

India should look at the electrification of mobility very closely, because currently we have low oil prices...

""In many countries, electric cars and commercial cars have the same prices.

Targeting Pakistan’s Funding Sources

IMF’s Strong Warning to Pakistan

Pakistan may not want to go to the world with a ‘begging bowl’, but the fact remains that its economy is in dire straits. During a recent address, Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif acknowledged the country’s extremely poor economic condition and emphasised that the world does not want it to come to it with a ‘begging bowl’. He said Pakistan needs to focus on international investments rather than financial assistance.However, seeking bailout packages is not new for Pakistan. It has a long history of asking for loans and funds from external institutions and countries, and doing little to improve its economic indicators. Recently, Pakistan's National Accounts Committee said that the country’s GDP growth fell short of official projections for FY 2024-25, achieving only 2.68 per cent growth compared to the targeted 3.6 per cent.Pakistan's economic recovery remains delicate as it works under a $7 billion International Monetary Fund programme. The conditions of this financial package necessitate structural changes, including increased electricity rates and additional taxation measures.Also Read | Explained in charts: India to become 4th largest world economy soon. What's the road ahead to No.3 spot? Pakistan aims to obtain external commercial funding amounting to $4.9 billion during fiscal year 2025-26. The government’s aim is to secure $2.64 billion in short-term commercial bank borrowings.Pakistan's economy faces multiple challenges and risks, and India’s punitive measures post the Pahalgam terror attack are not making it easier for Islamabad to emerge stronger.The agriculture sector, which provides employment to about 40% of the labour force, is facing substantial disturbances following India's move to suspend the Indus Waters Treaty.The kharif (summer crops) planting period in Pakistan faces significant challenges due to severely reduced water levels at its crucial dams - Mangla on river Jhelum and Tarbela on the Indus river. Additionally, there has been an abrupt reduction in Chenab river flow following India's water regulation after the Pahalgam terror incident. The water crisis could worsen during the early kharif sowing period this month.According to recent data from Pakistan's Indus River System Authority (IRSA), the country currently has a 21% deficit in water flow, whilst the two primary dams show approximately 50% reduction in live storage. These dams are vital for irrigation in Pakistan's Punjab and Sindh provinces, as well as for hydroelectric power generation.The IRSA's recent evaluation of water availability for summer sowing during May-Sept highlighted concerns about reduced water flow in river Chenab at Marala, attributing it to India's limited supply, which would affect early kharif season operations, according to a TOI report.Also Read | India’s big crackdown! 20 export houses under scanner for illicit Pakistan trade using UAE route; trade-based money laundering suspected The authority announced a 21% overall deficit and instructed reservoir management and irrigation monitoring bodies to carefully manage water resources from storage facilities, considering the ""crisis created by Indian short supplies in Chenab river"".Whilst monsoon in the catchment region could potentially improve conditions by next month, Pakistan's agricultural activities will be significantly influenced by India's management of water flow through its limited storage facilities - Baglihar and Salal - situated on the Chenab in J&K.Officials believe India's suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty could significantly impact Pakistan's ability to handle flood situations during peak flow periods when monsoon affects the Indus river system's catchment areas, with a substantial portion situated within India.Agricultural activities in Pakistan's Punjab and Sindh provinces are entirely reliant on irrigation channels connected to the Indus river network, which receives nearly all its water from the western rivers - Indus, Jhelum and Chenab.India aims to restrict Pakistan's access to funds in its ongoing efforts against state-sponsored terrorism from across the border. Following its opposition to Pakistan's IMF bailout package, India intends to challenge forthcoming World Bank loans earmarked for Pakistan as well.Furthermore, India intends to approach the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), the global financial crime watchdog, seeking Pakistan's return to its ‘grey list’.Pakistan's exit from the FATF grey list in 2022 had improved its credibility with financial institutions, which was vital for its economically challenged situation. If FATF puts Pakistan back on the ‘grey list’, it will make it more difficult for the country to get investment.Also Read | ‘Big ban’ actions: How India is shunning Pakistan and its allies like Turkey & Azerbaijan - top 5 measures Even as it grapples with agriculture crises, Pakistan has also been issued a strong warning by the IMF over its bailout package. The IMF has substantially increased its loan programme prerequisites for Pakistan. The IMF has outlined 11 new conditions for Pakistan to secure continued financial support, including passing a Rs 17.6 trillion federal budget aligned with IMF targets by June 2025 and implementing agricultural income tax reforms across all provinces.Other key requirements include publishing a governance reform plan, preparing a long-term financial sector strategy, rebasing electricity tariffs by July, and adjusting gas tariffs by February 2026. The IMF also demands permanent legislation for a captive power levy, removal of the cap on a debt servicing surcharge, phasing out tax incentives in special technology zones by 2035, liberalizing used car imports, and allocating Rs 1.07 trillion for development spending.","Pakistan's economic recovery remains delicate as it works under a $7 billion International Monetary Fund programme.

US Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller hinted on Monday that interest rate cuts could still be on the table in the coming months, even amid potential inflationary pressures from newly introduced tariffs.Speaking at an event in Seoul, South Korea, Waller said, ""I support looking through any tariff effects on near term-inflation when setting the policy rate,"" adding that the inflation impact stemming from President Donald Trump 's recent import taxes is likely to be temporary, reported Reuters.Waller indicated that if tariff levels remain in the low range, and “underlying inflation continues to make progress to our 2% goal” while the labor market remains “solid,” he would support “good news” rate cuts later this year. “Fortunately, the strong labor market and progress on inflation through April gives me additional time to see how trade negotiations play out and the economy evolves,” he said.His remarks come amid growing uncertainty surrounding presidential trade policies, as Trump imposes tariffs with variable rates and implementation timelines. Legal challenges to these tariffs also raise questions about their long-term viability.The federal funds target rate currently stands between 4.25 per cent and 4.5 per cent.Waller acknowledged the complex risk environment, noting, “I see downside risks to economic activity and employment and upside risks to inflation in the second half of 2025, but how these risks evolve is strongly tied to how trade policy evolves.”He also cautioned that higher tariffs could have a negative impact on consumer spending and business operations. “Higher tariffs will reduce spending, and businesses will respond, in part, by reducing production and payrolls,” he said. Waller anticipates a one-time inflation spike, particularly in late 2025, with consumers likely absorbing only part of the effect from modest tariffs.Also read: GTRI recommends this ‘pragmatic route’ for India to deal with Donald Trump’s tariffs on steel & aluminium Addressing concerns about a repeat of past policy misjudgments, Waller said, “What often has people spooked is we had the same view in 2021, that all this stuff was transitory, it was a one-time level effect, and then it would all go away.” However, he stressed that the current economic environment differs significantly from that of the pandemic era.Turning to financial markets, Waller raised concerns about foreign sentiment toward US government debt. “There's been a risk-off attitude from foreign buyers of Treasuries, all US assets ... It's not really that big, but it's definitely there,” he said, adding, “There seems to be an attitude that foreign buyers of assets are not welcome in some sense.”","US Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller hinted on Monday that interest rate cuts could still be on the table in the coming months.

Stock markets in the United States opened with a slight decline, surrendering a portion of their gains from May, which marked their strongest performance since 2023.During early Monday trading, the S&P 500 declined by 0.3%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 174 points, representing a 0.4% decrease, whilst the Nasdaq composite fell by 0.2%.This was driven by crude oil prices that surged more than 4%. Despite OPEC+ nations agreeing to boost their output further, market analysts noted this decision was largely anticipated by investors. Additionally, Ukrainian strikes within Russian territory over the weekend heightened concerns regarding global oil and gas distribution.Global trade tensions also contributed to the decline as Beijing dismissed US claims regarding breach of tariff reduction agreements. Simultaneously, tensions with the European Union escalated following Trump's proposal to increase steel duties twofold.This was in line with the expectation of Wall Street opening on Monday. The intensifying Russia-Ukraine situation over the weekend heightened market concerns and drove oil prices upward.Prior to Monday's opening bell, S&P 500 futures declined 0.4%, whilst Dow Jones Industrial Average futures decreased 0.3%. The Nasdaq futures showed a reduction of 0.6%.The escalating Russia-Ukraine conflict, coupled with OPEC+'s decision to implement a smaller-than-anticipated production increase, led to rising oil prices and gains in oil company shares.Devon Energy experienced a 2.5% increase, whilst Chevron, Exxon and ConocoPhillips each gained between 1% and 1.5%.The US benchmark crude oil rose by $2.54, exceeding 4%, reaching $63.33 per barrel. Simultaneously, Brent crude, the global benchmark, increased by $2.34 to $65.12 per barrel.Steel sector shares witnessed substantial gains after President Donald Trump announced to Pennsylvania steelworkers on Friday his decision to increase steel import tariffs to 50%, doubling the previous rate to safeguard their industry. This significant increase could potentially raise prices for steel, a crucial material in housing, automotive and various other manufactured goods.","The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 174 points, representing a 0.4% decrease, whilst the Nasdaq composite fell by 0.2%.

China on Monday criticised the US for a series of moves, including new restrictions on AI chip exports, blocking chip design software sales, and reportedly planning to revoke student visas for Chinese nationals.Last week, US secretary of state Marco Rubio pledged to ""aggressively"" revoke visas for Chinese students, a broad measure that has alarmed families, university administrators, and Chinese officials. Currently, more than 275,000 Chinese students are enrolled at US universities.China's foreign ministry swiftly denounced the decision. Spokesperson Mao Ning called the visa revocations “unreasonable” and “politicised,” accusing the US of betraying its own principles of freedom and openness.""China has lodged a protest with the US,” she said, according to AP.“These practices seriously violate the consensus” China’s commerce ministry said in a statement last month during trade talks in Geneva.China also rejected the US's claims of breaching the deal, which was a 90-day truce between the world’s two largest economies in which both sides agreed to reduce steep tariffs imposed during a prolonged trade war.Under the deal, the US agreed to lower the 145 per cent tariff to 30 per cent , while China agreed to reduce its rate from 125 per cent to 10 per cent. China also claimed to have suspended other trade measures as part of its commitments.China’s commerce ministry accused the US of backtracking and acting unilaterally. “Instead of reflecting on itself, it has turned the tables and unreasonably accused China of violating the consensus, which is seriously contrary to the facts,” it said.Tensions flared again on Friday when US President Donald Trump accused China of violating the agreement.In a post on Truth Social, Trump said, “The bad news is that China, perhaps not surprisingly to some, HAS TOTALLY VIOLATED ITS AGREEMENT WITH US. So much for being Mr. NICE GUY!”However, later that day in the Oval office Trump said he would speak with Chinese President Xi Jinping and “hopefully we’ll work that out.”Last week, the Trump administration announced that it will start revoking visas of Chinese students studying in the US, further intensifying the clash.Both nations are competing to lead in cutting-edge technologies like artificial intelligence, with Washington aiming to restrict China’s access to the most sophisticated computer chips.Meanwhile, China is striving to surpass the US as the dominant power in the Asia-Pacific region, including efforts to assert control over Taiwan, a close US ally and major tech powerhouse","China criticises US for new restrictions on AI chip exports, blocking chip design software sales, and reportedly planning to revoke student visas.

AI to hit entry-level white-collar roles hardest: Jefferies report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/ai-to-hit-entry-level-white-collar-roles-hardest-jefferies-report/articleshow/121568719.cms,"Representative AI image

Entry-level white-collar positions are likely to be the most affected by Artificial Intelligence (AI) implementation, according to a recent report by Jefferies. The findings highlight growing employment concerns for new workforce entrants in the United States, particularly recent university graduates.Currently, the unemployment rate for recent US university graduates stands at 5.8 per cent- well above the national average of 4 per cent and more than double the 2.7 per cent rate recorded among all university graduates.""We believe AI's most significant impact for investors will be through labour disruption, beginning with entry-level roles,"" said Jefferies, as quoted by ANI.The report claimed that that individuals entering the workforce are encountering greater employment challenges compared to other demographic groups.Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei, cited in the report, projected that AI could replace as much as half of entry-level white-collar jobs within one to five years. Amodei also warned that this trend could lead to a sharp rise in unemployment, potentially reaching between 10 per cent and 20 per cent.Sales, customer support, software development and marketing were identified as particularly vulnerable sectors, with junior-level staff forming a significant share of the workforce in these areas.The report also noted that a degree in technology no longer assures job security. Unemployment rates among recent graduates in Computer Engineering and Computer Science have reached 7.5 per cent and 6.1 per cent respectively.AI’s growing presence is evident across industries. Jefferies' research shows that out of 419 US companies that discussed AI in their earnings calls since 2021, 40 per cent came from non-tech sectors such as retail, finance and healthcare.Industry leaders present differing views on the impact of AI adoption. IBM CEO Arvind Krishna reported a net increase in employment following AI integration. In contrast, Klarna’s CEO admitted that AI-led staff reductions compromised customer service quality, potentially requiring the company to rehire in the future.The Jefferies analysis positions AI as both a transformative opportunity and a serious challenge. While AI may drive efficiency and growth, it also raises significant concerns for early-career professionals.The report also stressed on the need for a coordinated response from corporations, governments and educational institutions to promote skill development and support workplace transitions in the AI era.","Recent US university graduates have the highest unemployment rate at 5.8 per cent.

Will Trump Be Forced To Refund?

Tariff Impact: $34 billion losses and counting…and counting..

What will happen if the US trade court ruling against American President Donald Trump ’s reciprocal tariffs is upheld? If that happens, it could necessitate the Trump administration to refund billions in import duties that have already been collected!On Wednesday, the US Court of International Trade (CIT) panel, comprising three judges, determined that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) did not authorise Trump to implement extensive tariffs or circumvent Congress's traditional authority over economic and commerce policies.Trump had referenced this 1977 legislation to validate most of his tariff implementations, particularly those announced on ""’Liberation Day’ in early April.In a recent post on Truth Social, Trump has warned that any ruling that halts tariffs will be detrimental for the US economy. ""If the Courts somehow rule against us on Tariffs, which is not expected, that would allow other Countries to hold our Nation hostage with their anti-American Tariffs that they would use against us. This would mean the Economic ruination of the United States of America!,"" he said.According to a NewsWeek report, Todd Tucker, a trade specialist from the Roosevelt Institute in New York, shared on BlueSky on Thursday: ""This will do tremendous damage to Trump's agenda. His whole second term seemed to be DOGE, deport, and (trade) deals."" He further questioned: ""On trade, in particular, why would any country waste time negotiating to lower his tariffs if he can't impose them in the first place?""The government has lodged an appeal with the Court of Appeals of the Federal Circuit, describing the CIT's decision as a ""judicial coup.""Experts suggest alternative methods remain available for Trump to implement his trade policies in response to the ruling.The NewsWeek report said that if the ruling is upheld it could mean the Trump administration will have to reimburse the substantial import duties already collected. Whilst The Kobeissi Letter assessed collected tariff revenue at $10 billion since April 2, Newsweek's examination of Treasury Department records indicates potentially larger amounts.Also Read | ‘Work of fiction…’: Will Donald Trump bury US government in debt with multitrillion-dollar tax breaks? Even Elon Musk is concerned ""I think that the court's order should lead CBP (US Customs and Border Protection) to suspend liquidation of entries going forward, which would mean that if the court's decision is ultimately upheld, importers can get their money back,"" stated William Reinsch, who served as under secretary of commerce for export administration during the Clinton administration and led the National Foreign Trade Council from 2001 to 2016.Importers, including American companies and overseas exporters who are bound by contract to pay import duties, might qualify for refunds. However, according to Reinsch's statement to Newsweek, consumers are ""probably not"" likely to receive any refunds following the CIT's ruling, despite having paid higher prices for imported products in recent months.""The people who paid the tariffs—the importers—might get their money back, but they would not be obligated to pass that on to consumers, although some might choose to do so as a matter of goodwill,"" he explained. He further expressed doubt about the success of any potential legal action by consumers against the government for compensation.According to the report, legal experts suggest that importers could potentially take legal action against the administration for goods that have already cleared customs procedures.The administration under Trump has recognised its obligation to reimburse specific tariff payments in cases where duties are subsequently eliminated or reduced. Following a decision in late April that determined certain tariffs should not be 'stacked' or applied cumulatively, Trump issued an executive order stating this would have retroactive application to particular tariffs. The order also confirmed that reimbursements for those who had paid increased import duties would be handled according to existing laws and standard CBP refund procedures.When announcements were made regarding exemptions to Trump's reciprocal tariffs, similar details were provided. The CBP has also issued instructions detailing how importers can seek refunds for duty payments on items where tariffs were later withdrawn or decreased.Also Read | ‘Went COLD TURKEY, it was devastating for them…’: Donald Trump slams China for ‘violating’ trade agreement with US - what went wrong this time? Meanwhile, corporate disclosures reveal that Trump's trade policies have resulted in companies losing more than $34 billion through decreased sales and increased expenses, as per Reuters' evaluation. This impact is likely to grow as businesses struggle with uncertainty surrounding tariffs, affecting operational decisions at major global corporations.Prominent organisations across three continents have seen significant setbacks. Notable examples include Apple, Ford, Porsche and Sony, which have either withdrawn or substantially reduced their profit projections. Most companies indicate that the unpredictable implementation of Trump's trade measures has rendered precise cost calculations unfeasible.The combined total of $33 billion represents calculations from 32 S&P 500 firms, three STOXX 600 enterprises and 21 Nikkei 225 organisations. According to financial experts, the actual business impact is expected to significantly exceed the currently reported figures.""You can double or triple your tally and we'd still say ... the magnitude is bound to be far greater than most people realize,"" said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, professor at the Yale School of Management, according to the Reuters report.The broader implications could prove more severe, Sonnenfeld noted, pointing to possible reductions in consumer and business expenditure, alongside heightened inflation projections.Also Read | ‘Even if we lose…’: Donald Trump administration readying two-part strategy to impose reciprocal tariffs, says ‘we will do it another way’","The US Court of International Trade (CIT) ruled that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) did not authorise Trump to implement extensive tariffs.

Trump Vs Xi War: US 'Orders' Firms To Stop Selling To China, Cracks Down On Chinese Student Visas

US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping may soon talk to ease the mounting issues in the US-China trade deal. According to US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, a conversation between Trump and Xi Jinping might occur ""very soon,"" suggesting this dialogue could potentially resolve the current deadlock in trade negotiations between the world’s top two economies.Trump had expressed criticism on Friday regarding Beijing's alleged breach of an agreement reached in Geneva last month, which was brokered by Bessent. The agreement aimed to temporarily reduce the substantial tariffs both nations had implemented, with a planned duration of 90 days.The Wall Street Journal's Friday report, subsequently verified by US officials, highlighted American concerns regarding China's deliberate delays in approving export licences for rare earths and other crucial components essential for automobile and semiconductor manufacturing.However, Bessent adopted a more conciliatory tone during his appearance on CBS's ""Face the Nation,"" expressing confidence that the existing differences between the two nations could be resolved.""I'm confident that when President Trump and Party Chairman Xi have a call that this will be ironed out,"" Bessent said, however noting that China was ""withholding some of the products that they agreed to release during our agreement.""When questioned about rare earths being amongst those products, Bessent confirmed with a ""Yes.""""Maybe it's a glitch in the Chinese system. Maybe it's intentional. We'll see after the president speaks with"" Xi, he said.Also Read | ‘Work of fiction…’: Will Donald Trump bury US government in debt with multitrillion-dollar tax breaks?

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Space sector start-up Sisir Radar to develop SAR on L/P band SAR,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/space-sector-start-up-sisir-radar-to-develop-sar-on-l/p-band-sar/articleshow/104558111.cms,"CHENNAI: Space sector startup, Sisir Radar Private Ltd has hit success at the prestigious iDEX DefSpace Challenge with its projects for development of “L/P band Continuous Wave SAR (synthetic aperture radar) payload for LEO Small Satellites” and “Unfurlable, Electronically Steering Antenna for L/P band SAR payload” for Indian Air Force (IAF), said a top company official.The company is promoted by former Director at the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) Tapan Misra and the brains behind the Indian space agency’s RISAT series of SAR satellites as well as the Dual Frequency SAR on the Chandrayaan 2 orbiter that is currently circling the moon.""A grant of Rs 3 crore is also there for development of the products,"" Misra told IANS.Synthetic Aperture Radar or SAR is a special kind of imaging radar technology that can provide extremely accurate high resolution imagery of the terrain through clouds, smoke and dust even in pitch dark conditions. SAR imagery provides much higher resolution than other forms of remote sensing technology such as hyperspectral and multispectral. SAR is a critical technology for strategic reconnaissance and planning as well as for disaster management.According to Misra, winning the challenge in just over a year of floating the company is a major booster.He said L and P band SAR have an advantage over other frequencies (like X band) when it comes to penetration capabilities through rain, clouds, foliage and vegetation in a tropical country like India, and underground penetration capabilities in dry terrain.Continuing further, he said the L band SAR will provide 1 metre resolution, spotlight resolution in Stripmap mode. The current industry standard is 5-10 metre in L band. Misra said both the L and P band will operate simultaneously from a satellite borne SAR. Recently, Sisir Radar successfully developed and tested the world’s highest resolution L-Band SAR fitted on a drone. With 0.2 metre resolution, this is by far the highest L band SAR in the world, he said.","Space sector startup, Sisir Radar Private Ltd has hit success at the prestigious iDEX DefSpace Challenge.

Testify: Sam Bankman-Fried acknowledges 'mistakes' but testifies he did not defraud anyone,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/cryptocurrency/sam-bankman-fried-acknowledges-mistakes-but-testifies-he-did-not-defraud-anyone/articleshow/104761929.cms,"<p>Sam Bankman-Fried (File Photo- Reuters)<br></p>

NEW YORK: Sam Bankman-Fried , testifying in his own defense at his fraud trial on Friday, acknowledged that a ""lot of people got hurt"" when the FTX cryptocurrency exchange he founded collapsed, but said he did not defraud anyone or take customer funds.Shortly after taking the witness stand in Manhattan federal court, Bankman-Fried said he made ""a number of small mistakes and a number of larger mistakes"" while running the now-bankrupt exchange. The biggest mistake, he said, was not implementing a dedicated risk management team.""We thought that we might be able to build the best product on the market,"" Bankman-Fried said. ""It turned out basically the opposite of that. A lot of people got hurt - customers, employees - and the company ended up in bankruptcy.""Prosecutors accuse Bankman-Fried of using FTX customer funds to prop up his crypto-focused hedge fund, Alameda Research, make speculative venture investments and donate more than $100 million to US political campaigns. He also faces charges of scheming to cheat Alameda's lenders and FTX investors.He has pleaded not guiltyBankman-Fried's trial, which began on October 3, is drawing to a close nearly a year after FTX collapsed amid a wave of customer withdrawals. The company declared bankruptcy in November 2022 and Bankman-Fried was indicted the following month.His testimony marked the first time the dozen jurors and five alternates have heard directly from the 31-year-old former billionaire after 12 trial days.Bankman-Fried, who was jailed in August after US District Judge Lewis Kaplan found he likely tampered with witnesses, wore a suit and spoke with two water bottles placed in front of him on the witness stand. The former mogul once known for wearing shorts and T-shirts and sporting an unkempt mop of curly locks cut his hair before his trial began.Responding to questions posed by his defense lawyer Mark Cohen, Bankman-Fried spoke in calm, measured tones during the first portion of his testimony as he recounted founding Alameda in 2017, shortly after graduating from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, despite knowing little about crypto.But Bankman-Fried - who had studied physics and worked as a quantitative trader at Jane Street - said he saw opportunities for ""arbitrage"" in the market for digital assets. He said Alameda's first office was in a small Airbnb in Berkeley, California, before he later moved the firm to Hong Kong.""We wanted to be under the radar at that point in time,"" he said on the stand, adding he named the hedge fund after the California county where it was founded in part so competitors would not discover what they were doing.Jurors have heard from three of his closest confidantes at FTX and Alameda, all of whom have pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors. They testified earlier this month that they committed financial crimes at Bankman-Fried's behest.For criminal defendants, taking the stand is a risky proposition because it opens them up to potentially probing cross-examination by prosecutors.But given Bankman-Fried's penchant for risk, legal experts say he likely viewed taking the stand as his best shot to counter the allegations made by members of his inner circle, which were backed up by spreadsheets the three said demonstrated how customer funds were stolen and text messages in which they discussed FTX's shortfall of funds with Bankman-Fried.","Sam Bankman-Fried says he made ""a number of small mistakes and a number of larger mistakes"" while running the now-bankrupt exchange.

"Crypto isn’t dead, it’s evolving rapidly to create a new world",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/cryptocurrency/crypto-isnt-dead-its-evolving-rapidly-to-create-a-new-world/articleshow/101324954.cms,"Regulatory landscape



There are few technologies as confusing to most people as crypto and blockchain. The tech and regulations underpinning it are evolving so rapidly, it is difficult for even technologists to often make sense of it.Crypto assets and crypto currencies are based on blockchain tech, which is a form of distributed ledger technology that stores data on thousands of data servers around the world, as opposed to today where data is stored only in one place or clustered in a few locations. This data is open, meaning it can be viewed and verified by anyone taking part in that particular system. What this means practically is that an individual can transfer crypto assets without the help of intermediaries, say, banks or government agencies, thereby ensuring privacy, speed and lower costs.The first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin , was created with anonymity in mind, it was a way for people to conduct financial transactions away from the prying eyes of governments. While it went on to become a speculative asset, today, crypto, and the underlying blockchain technology, has a far more ambitious goal – the transformation of the internet.CoinDCX CTO Vivek Gupta says this technology can help usher in Web 3. 0 – a decentralised form of the internet where users can actually monetise their time spent online. “Whatever Web3 use case you may be driving, the value that comes from it must be distributed, and you cannot distribute that without crypto. For something as simple as depositing money in a pool and getting a receipt token, that receipt token is a crypto. That’s the proof that I have deposited the money. Without crypto there is no Web3 use case,” he says.Decentralised finance (DeFi) is a huge part of what makes blockchain tech so disruptive. Imagine being able to lend your money to strangers on the internet and get paid an interest. Or imagine spending time on socialmedia platforms or playing video games and getting paid for your time spent by someone who needs data about you. Web3 makes this possible because the data isn’t controlled by any one company or country.Decentralised apps (dApps) are another Web3 feature. Unlike traditional apps hosted on centralised servers, dApps operate on a peer-to-peer network and utilisethe consensus mechanism and transparency features of blockchain technology.“I see a big disruption coming, especially in the DeFi tokenisation space and the whole content creator economy,” says Ravi Chamria, co-founder & CEO of Zeeve, a blockchain automation platform.Ashish Singhal, co-founder & CEO of CoinSwitch, says the tech can revolutionise how we conduct business, store data, and even vote, since the tech allows people to verify data of any kind efficiently.Governments are worried about what crypto could mean for monetary policy, for their ability to regulate people’s lives. But disruption hardly ever requires consensus. If a new technology proves to be better than an old one, people will drift towards it.Central banks have recognised the importance of the technology and some are creating Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) that are based on blockchain technology. “There’s a lot of activity happening in the regulated DeFi space. Looking at the future, we think guardrails are probably a good thing to have around these sorts of technologies,” says Andrew Vranjes, VP of sales at Blockdaemon, a blockchain infrastructure platform.Cryptocurrencies too are rapidly changing. Where before the value of cryptocurrencies were based on what people were willing to pay for them, today there are crypto assets that are backed by real world assets like equity and real estate. Silvina Moschini’s Unicoin is one of them. “It is an assets backed, audited, SEC-compliant cryptocurrency,” she says.","Crypto assets and crypto currencies are based on blockchain tech, which is a form of distributed ledger technology that stores data on thousands of data servers around the world.

"US tightens crackdown on crypto with lawsuits against Coinbase, Binance",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/cryptocurrency/bitcoin/us-tightens-crackdown-on-crypto-with-lawsuits-against-coinbase-binance/articleshow/100810119.cms,"BROKER, EXCHANGE CRACKDOWN



NEW YORK: The top U.S. securities regulator sued cryptocurrency platform Coinbase on Tuesday, the second lawsuit in two days against a major crypto exchange, in a dramatic escalation of a crackdown on the industry and one that could dramatically transform a market that has largely operated outside regulation.The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Monday took aim at Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange. The SEC accuses Binance and its CEO Changpeng Zhao of operating a ""web of deception"".If successful, the lawsuits could transform the crypto market by successfully asserting the SEC's jurisdiction over the industry which for years has argued that tokens do not constitute securities and should not be regulated by the SEC.""The two cases are different, but overlap and point in the same direction: the SEC's increasingly aggressive campaign to bring cryptocurrencies under the jurisdiction of the federal securities laws,"" said Kevin O'Brien, a partner at Ford O'Brien Landy and a former federal prosecutor, adding, however, that the SEC has not previously taken on such major crypto players.""If the SEC prevails in either case, the cryptocurrency industry will be transformed.""In its complaint filed in Manhattan federal court, the SEC said Coinbase has since at least 2019 made billions of dollars by operating as a middleman on crypto transactions, while evading disclosure requirements meant to protect investors.The SEC said Coinbase traded at least 13 crypto assets that are securities that should have been registered, including tokens such as Solana, Cardano and Polygon.Coinbase suffered about $1.28 billion of net customer outflows following the lawsuit, according to initial estimates from data firm Nansen. Shares of Coinbase's parent Coinbase Global Inc closed down $7.10, or 12.1%, at $51.61 after earlier falling as much as 20.9%. They are up 46% this year.Paul Grewal, Coinbase's general counsel, in a statement said the company will continue operating as usual and has ""demonstrated commitment to compliance.""Oanda senior market analyst Ed Moya said the SEC ""looks like it's playing Whac-A-Mole with crypto exchanges,"" and because most exchanges offer a range of tokens that operate on blockchain protocols targeted by regulators, ""it seems like this is just the beginning.""Leading cryptocurrency bitcoin has been a paradoxical beneficiary of the crackdown.After an initial plunge to a nearly three-month low of $25,350 following the Binance suit, bitcoin rebounded by more than $2,000, exceeding the previous day's high. It was trading just below $27,000 at 0410 GMT.""The SEC is making life nearly impossible for several altcoins and that is actually driving some crypto traders back into bitcoin,"" explained Oanda's Moya.Securities, as opposed to other assets such as commodities, are strictly regulated and require detailed disclosures to inform investors of potential risks. The Securities Act of 1933 outlined a definition of the term ""security,"" yet many experts rely on two U.S. Supreme Court cases to determine if an investment product constitutes a security.SEC Chair Gary Gensler has long said tokens constitute securities and has steadily asserted its authority over the crypto market, focusing initially on the sale of tokens and interest-bearing crypto products. More recently, it has taken aim at unregistered crypto broker dealer, exchange trading and clearing activity.While a few crypto companies are licensed as alternative system trading systems, a type of trading platform used by brokers to trade listed securities, no crypto platform operates as a full-blown stock exchange. The SEC also this year sued Beaxy Digital and Bittrex Global for failing to register as an exchange, clearing house and broker.""The whole business model is built on a noncompliance with the U.S. securities laws and we're asking them to come into compliance,"" Gensler told CNBC.Crypto companies refute that tokens meet the definition of a security, say the SEC's rules are ambiguous, and that the SEC is overstepping its authority in trying to regulate them. Still, many companies have boosted compliance, shelved products and expanded outside the country in response to the crackdown.Kristin Smith, CEO of the Blockchain Association trade group, rejected Gensler's efforts to oversee the industry.""We're confident the courts will prove Chair Gensler wrong in due time,"" she said.Founded in 2012, Coinbase recently served more than 108 million customers and ended March with $130 billion of customer crypto assets and funds on its balance sheet. Transactions generated 75% of its $3.15 billion of net revenue last year.Tuesday's SEC lawsuit seeks civil fines, the recouping of ill-gotten gains and injunctive relief.On Monday, the SEC accused Binance of inflating trading volumes, diverting customer funds, improperly commingling assets, failing to restrict U.S. customers from its platform, and misleading customers about its controls.Binance pledged to vigorously defend itself against the lawsuit, which it said reflected the SEC's ""misguided and conscious refusal"" to provide clarity to the crypto industry.Customers pulled around $790 million from Binance and its U.S. affiliate following the lawsuit, Nansen said.On Tuesday, the SEC filed a motion to freeze assets belonging to Binance.US, Binance's U.S. affiliate. The holding company of Binance is based in the Cayman Islands.""It's important to note that recent regulatory actions are aimed at ensuring that companies operating in the cryptocurrency industry are complying with securities laws and protecting investors - this will always be their goal,"" said Joshua Chu, group chief risk officer at blockchain technology firms XBE, Coinllectibles and Marvion.""These events will ultimately lead to a more stable and trustworthy industry, which could help to attract more institutional investors and mainstream adoption.""","The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Monday took aim at Binance.

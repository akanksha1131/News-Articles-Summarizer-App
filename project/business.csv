Will the flow of Russian crude completely stop?

US President Donald Trump’s sanctions on two of Russia’s biggest oil majors - Rosneft and Lukoil - come into effect today - November 21, 2025 which was set as the wind-down deadline by the US Treasury Department. Will the move finally get Trump what he wants - that India stops buying oil from Russia?The Trump administration announced sanctions on Open Joint Stock Company Rosneft Oil Company (Rosneft) and Lukoil OAO (Lukoil), alleging that their financial contributions support Moscow's military operations in Ukraine. The European Union has also implemented restrictions prohibiting the purchase of petroleum products that are derived from Russian crude oil, which begin from January 2026.Trump has imposed a 25% penal tariff on Indian exports in lieu of its crude oil imports from Russia and this has been an impediment in the ongoing discussions for a trade deal with India. While the tariffs have not deterred India from buying Russia’s crude, the sanctions on Russian oil majors may have the desired effect.Russian crude loadings headed for India have dropped sharply - at ~982 kbd in November till 20th November, according to data from Kpler, a global real-time data and analytics provider. This is the lowest level since October 2022.“While volumes may still shift, as some in-transit vessels could revise their final destinations, the trend is clear: India-bound flows are softening. Loadings have already slowed since 21 October, though it is still early for definitive conclusions given Russia’s agility in deploying intermediaries, shadow fleets, and workaround financing,” says Kpler.According to a Bloomberg report, approximately 48 million barrels of Russian oil could become stranded at sea. This could cause several vessels to urgently seek new delivery locations. This development would mark another significant disruption in international oil trade.Experts are of the view that Trump’s sanctions on Rosneft and Lukoil will serve to be an effective measure to get India to diversify away from Russian crude oil imports. As per data, Russia has supplied approximately 34% of India's crude oil this year, of which Rosneft and Lukoil have contributed approximately 60% in volume. With these two Russian oil majors being sanctioned, Indian refiners have little option but to stop procuring from them, at least for export purposes.Kpler predicts that with the November 21 deadline, Indian refiners (except Nayara), will stop direct procurement of crude oil from the sanctioned Russian entities.This is expected to cause a significant reduction in Russian oil deliveries to India, particularly during December and January, it says.According to Sumit Ritolia, Lead Research Analyst, Refining and Modelling at Kpler, the recent US sanctions on Rosneft and Lukoil represent a meaningful escalation and are set to temporarily reshape India’s crude import flows—even if they do not alter New Delhi’s long-term strategy of maintaining diversified, cost-advantaged supply.While shipments have decreased since October 21, it is still premature to draw any conclusions on Russian imports being completely halted since Russia has in the past shown its ability to utilise intermediaries, shadow fleets, and workaround financing.Kpler is of the view that refineries will adopt a more conservative approach, utilising non-sanctioned traders, mixed oil sources, and sophisticated logistics to reduce their exposure to Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) regulations. “Russian supply will not disappear but will increasingly move through opaque channels,” says Sumit Ritolia of Kpler.At present, the shipping patterns indicate significant changes in Russian oil trading practices, characterised by unexpected route changes between India and China, alongside unusual Ship-to-Ship transfers near Mumbai's coastline, away from conventional transfer points near the Singapore Strait. These developments reflect evolving logistical tactics by Russian exporters navigating tightening Western sanctions, says Kpler.Reliance Industries Ltd, which is the main purchaser of Russian crude oil, has said that it will stop importing from Russia at its export-focused refinery in Jamnagar, Gujarat. RIL’s move aligns with the US and EU sanctions.""We have stopped importing Russian crude oil into our SEZ refinery with effect from November 20,"" RIL said on Thursday.RIL’s Jamnagar facility has two distinct units - there is an SEZ refinery that is dedicated to exports for the US, European Union, and other international markets - alongside a conventional unit that refines to serve domestic needs.From December 1, all product exports from the SEZ refinery will be obtained from non-Russian crude oil…The transition has been completed ahead of schedule to ensure full compliance with product-import restrictions coming into force in January 2026,” said RIL.India’s imports of Russian crude went up substantially after the latter offered oil at huge discounts following the start of its war with Ukraine. Before the Russia-Ukraine war, the share of Russian crude in India’s oil import basket was negligible. Since then it has gone up to almost 40%.In the run up to the November 21 wind-down deadline set by the Trump administration, India’s crude imports from Russia are expected to remain very strong — around 1.8–1.9 Mbd — as refiners continue to prioritise the most economical barrels ahead of the sanctions cutoff, says Kpler.After that imports are expected to decrease significantly in the immediate term, as shipments from Rosneft or Lukoil post-November 21 would face higher sanctions exposure and scrutiny.“Based on current understanding, no Indian refiner other than Nayara’s already-sanctioned Vadinar facility is likely to take the risk of dealing with OFAC-designated entities, and buyers will need time to reconfigure contracts, routing, ownership structures, and payment channels,” says Kpler.So what will India do now that Russian oil majors have been sanctioned? Kpler says that India has several options available to meet its needs.Given their sophisticated processing capabilities, Indian refiners can technically manage the replacement of Russian volumes, though this would impact profit margins for some facilities, it says.According to Kpler, Indian refiners are diversifying their crude oil sources to offset the impact of reduced Russian supplies. They are likely to source crude from:Freight costs on long-haul routes will cap substitution potential, but the overall import basket is likely to widen, says Sumit Ritolia.There is also the important point that India can continue to import Russian crude oil from non-sanctioned entities.The current sanctions specifically target Rosneft and Lukoil and their majority-owned subsidiaries, rather than all Russian oil producers.This means that crude supplied by non-designated Russian entities — for example Surgutneftegaz, Gazprom Neft, or independent traders using non-sanctioned intermediaries — can still be legally purchased by Indian refiners, as long as no sanctioned entity, vessel, bank, or service provider is involved, says Kpler.However, there are two significant challenges to that:1. Operational risks increase for all suppliers, including non-sanctioned ones, as OFAC might expand designations, whilst traders, banks, and insurers could reduce their involvement to avoid secondary sanctions.2. Supply volumes may not completely replace Rosneft/Lukoil quantities immediately, given their dominant position in Russia's export infrastructure and blend composition.Whilst non-sanctioned Russian producers can maintain supply chains, they face operational constraints and heightened risks, particularly if Western sanctions intensify or expand beyond currently designated entities.According to Kpler, there's been a noticeable uptick in undisclosed cargoes leaving Russian ports. “Many of these tankers had previously been discharged in India, indicating a potential continuation of flows via less transparent channels,” says Kpler.“However, diversions to other Asian buyers cannot be ruled out. For now, November buying remains fluid, but the drop in declared India-bound volumes aligns with expectations as refiners move cautiously ahead of the 21 November OFAC wind-down deadline,” it says.While the Trump administration and EU’s sanctions are expected to be a temporary jolt for Russian crude trade, its oil is unlikely to completely disappear from the world markets. Russia is an important supplier of oil in the world and its abrupt withdrawal from the market may cause price disruptions.“Despite near-term declines, a complete halt to Russian imports is unlikely. Discounted Russian barrels remain attractive for margins, and India’s energy policy continues to prioritise affordability and security over geopolitical pressure,” notes Kpler’s Sumit Ritolia.“Unless secondary sanctions directly target Indian buyers or New Delhi imposes formal restrictions—both low-probability scenarios—Russian crude will keep flowing to India, though via increasingly diversified and less transparent channels,” he adds.The long-term outlook depends entirely on how strictly the West enforces secondary sanctions and the potential introduction of any additional measures, such as sanctions on all Russian oil or even penalties for refineries that are processing Russian crude. Stricter enforcement would reduce volumes of Russian crude imports further, whilst a lenient implementation may allow for some recovery through intermediary channels.“Russian crude flows are entering a phase of heightened uncertainty and volatility as the supply chain adapts. New trading intermediaries, alternative shipowners, evolving payment mechanisms, STS transfers, and a shift toward “clean” (non-designated) sellers will all shape post-November trade,” says Kpler.“Until refiners gain clarity on compliant pathways — including secure non-sanctioned counterparties, shipping and insurance availability, and workable banking solutions — India’s imports from Russia will remain in choppy waters, marked by short-term disruptions (i.e., lower arrivals) and frequent shifts in sourcing patterns,” concludes Sumit Ritolia.",US President Donald Trump's sanctions on two of Russia's biggest oil majors - Rosneft and Lukoil - come into effect today. Trump has imposed a 25% penal tariff on Indian exports because of its crude oil imports from Russia.

Stock market today: Nifty50 and BSE Sensex , the Indian equity benchmark indices, opened in red on Friday on weak global cues. While Nifty50 was above 26,100, BSE Sensex was down over 250 points. At 9:16 AM, Nifty50 was trading at 26,109.45, down 83 points or 0.32%. BSE Sensex was at 85,382.02, down 251 points or 0.29%.Experts anticipate continued positive movement, considering domestic factors, worldwide economic data, foreign institutional investment patterns and expected developments in India-US trade relations.Dr. VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Investments Limited says, “Market volatility has spiked up. Nasdaq, the barometer of the AI trade, closed down 2.15% yesterday crashing 4.4% from the intraday peak. This kind of market movement is a signal of more volatility in store. While there are valuation concerns in AI stocks with many experts warning of a bubble burst, the Nvidia CEO disagreed with this cautionary warning with the statement “we see a different picture characterised by sustainable rise of advanced AI systems. ” At lower valuations, fresh buying may again emerge in AI stocks. We will have to wait and see how this volatile phase unfolds.”“There is excessive speculative trading in many stocks in India, particularly in some newly listed stocks. Retail investors better avoid such speculative trades which usually end in tears for the vast majority. The ideal investment strategy now would be to buy fairly-valued high quality stocks on declines and wait patiently. Since India has been an under-performer in this year’s AI trade, India will benefit if the AI trade fades and money starts flowing into non-AI stocks in countries like India. But a big crash would impact all markets. So wait and watch how things unfold”.Asian equities dropped following volatility in US markets, where an initial surge led by Nvidia Corp. quickly dissipated as investors moved away from high-risk assets including cryptocurrencies.Wall Street indices retreated on Thursday, reversing earlier gains, as initial optimism from Nvidia's results and US employment data faded, leaving investors uncertain about labour market conditions.The US dollar headed towards its strongest weekly performance in over a month on Friday, as investors assessed that the Federal Reserve would likely maintain rate, with the latest US employment report providing unclear signals for monetary policy direction.Foreign portfolio investors purchased shares worth Rs 284 crore net on Thursday.

Benchmark indices snapped its two weeks losing streak supported by record low India CPI data and as U.S. government shutdown came to an end. A majority for the ruling NDA party in the Bihar election further lifted sentiments. Nifty started the week on a positive note and rallied higher as the week progressed to form an intraweek high of 26010 on Thursday. Nifty traded with high volatility in last Friday’s session and closed the week at 25910.05 levels up by 1.64% on a weekly basis.Looking ahead, the bias stays positive. A sustained move above last month’s high of 26,100 could pave the way for a retest of the previous all-time high at 26,277 in this week.If Nifty fails to hold above 26,100, it may slip into a consolidation phase between 26,100 and 25,700 after its sharp 700-point rally over the past few sessions.Key short-term support lies at 25,500–25,300, where the 50-day EMA, a major previous breakout zone, and key retracement levels all converge.Bank Nifty had rallied over 600 points last week (+1.11%), closing at a new record high of 58,516.55 after hitting an all-time peak of 58,615.95, reflecting strong momentum across both PSU and private banks.Looking ahead, the index is expected to continue moving higher, with fresh all-time highs likely. The uptrend remains strong, supported by a consistent higher-high, higher-low pattern on the weekly chart.It is trading well above all major moving averages, with its support base steadily rising. Immediate support is seen near 57,600 — the earlier supply zone that has now turned supportive — followed by 57,200, which aligns with the lows of the past two weeks.On the upside, as the index heads into uncharted territory, the next resistance levels are at 59,300 and then 59,650, which matches the 61.8% Fibonacci extension of the previous weekly swing.While stochastic indicators suggest overbought conditions, any dips can still be used as buying opportunities.Fortis Healthcare is a leading integrated healthcare service provider in India. The healthcare verticals of the company primarily comprise hospitals, diagnostics and day care specialty facilities. Currently, the company operates its healthcare delivery services in India, Nepal, Dubai and Sri Lanka.The company controls its diagnostics business through its 57% owned subsidiary SRL Limited. It is amongst the largest private diagnostics chains. It has a presence in over 600 cities and towns, with an established strength of 415 laboratories, 8,200 direct clients and 1,400 collection centers.The company is entering a multi-year earnings upcycle supported by (1) the largest bed expansion program in its history, (2) rising ARPOB and occupancy levels driven by a richer case mix, (3) accelerating O&M-led network scaling without incremental capital, (4) diagnostics margin recovery toward industry standards (28%) , (5) Removal of key regulatory overhung following SEBI’s approval of the IHH open offer, and (6) a clear pathway to becoming net debt free by FY28.Valuation: We value Fortis Healthcare on FY28E EV/EBITDA multiple of 26x, with a target price of Rs. 1,051 given its transition into a structurally stronger, higher-growth driven quality-oriented hospital platform.The stock is forming a base and consolidating on the daily chart. It is trading near its key moving averages and has retested the breakout from its falling trendline resistance level.After a brief pullback, it has regained strength and closed above the previous day, indicating continued upside potential. The risk–reward setup looks positive, and the RSI moving above 50 further supports the bullish view.We expect the stock to move toward 340 in the near term, which aligns with the previous swing high.","According to Bajaj Broking Research, the top stock picks for November 21, 2025 are Fortis Healthcare, and Jio Financial Services.

Gold price prediction today: Gold prices are showing an intraday weakening bias, and traders should look to sell on rise, says Jateen Trivedi, VP Research Analyst - Commodity and Currency, LKP Securities. Here is his strategy for gold investors:Gold futures on MCX traded around ₹1,22,624, extending their consolidation as the market struggled to sustain momentum above short-term resistance levels. The recent price action suggests a shift in sentiment toward cautious selling on rallies, particularly as technical indicators begin to show fatigue near the higher band of the recent range.Moving Averages (EMA 8 & EMA 21): The short-term EMA 8 has slipped below the EMA 21, forming a bearish crossover. This indicates weakening momentum, with resistance now placed in the ₹1,22,700–₹1,22,850 zone. Sustaining below this range could invite further downside pressure.Bollinger Bands: Gold prices have retreated from the upper Bollinger band and are now testing the mid-band. This structure signals a cooling phase in the up move, suggesting that rallies are likely to face selling interest near the resistance area.Pivot Points (Previous Day):Gold’s intraday technical setup points to a weakening bias as short-term averages turn negative and momentum oscillators lean lower. Traders are advised to adopt a sell-on-rise strategy near ₹1,22,700–₹1,22,850, keeping a stop-loss at ₹1,23,200 and aiming for downside targets of ₹1,22,100 and ₹1,21,900.

Japan stimulus push: Cabinet approves $135.4 billion package,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/japan-stimulus-push-cabinet-approves-135-4-billion-package-heres-what-it-includes/articleshow/125477853.cms,"File photo: Japan's Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi (Picture credit: ANI)

Japan has moved ahead with a sweeping ¥21.3 trillion ($135 billion) stimulus push, the first major policy step under Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi.Her cabinet signed off on the plan on Friday, with the measures aimed at easing the pressure of rising prices on families and businesses.The approval marks the biggest stimulus since the Covid pandemic and reflects Takaichi’s promise to run an expansionary fiscal agenda, as per Reuters.The core of the package includes ¥17.7 trillion in general account spending, well above last year’s ¥13.9 trillion, along with ¥2.7 trillion in tax cuts.Local reports cited by news agency AFP said the bundle also features energy support for households.he government is expected to rely on higher tax revenues from inflation and a fresh round of bond issuance, which, according to Reuters, could exceed the ¥6.69 trillion issued for last year’s plan.A supplementary budget is due to be approved as early as 28 November, with the aim of getting parliament’s sign-off by year-end.Markets have reacted nervously to the plan’s scale. The yen has dropped to its weakest level in ten months, while long-term government bond yields touched record highs.Finance minister Satsuki Katayama hinted strongly at possible intervention, saying Tokyo would take “appropriate action against disorderly (foreign exchange) moves,” AFP reported.Analysts quoted by AFP warned that a further slide in the currency would deepen the strain on households reliant on imported food, fuel and raw materials.Takaichi has defended her approach, stressing earlier this week that her goal is to pursue a “responsible and proactive fiscal policy” and keep living costs in check.Official data showed core inflation rising to 3% in October, up from 2.9% in September, with rice about 40% costlier than this time last year, according to AFP.The package also comes after the economy shrank 0.4% in the third quarter, marking Japan’s first contraction since early 2024.Alongside economic concerns, Tokyo faces rising diplomatic tensions with Beijing. China summoned Japan’s ambassador after Takaichi suggested Japan could respond militarily if Taiwan were attacked.Media reports said Beijing is preparing to halt Japanese seafood imports, though neither side has confirmed it.Takaichi, who took office last month, has argued that heavy spending is necessary to reduce the burden on households and spur investment in fields like AI, chips and shipbuilding.","Japan moves ahead with sweeping ¥21.3 trillion ($135 billion) stimulus push.

US court enters $1 billion default judgment against Byju Raveendran,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-court-enters-1-billion-default-judgment-against-byju-raveendran/articleshow/125498536.cms,"File photo: Byju Raveendran (Picture credit: IANS)

BENGALURU: The Delaware Bankruptcy Court has entered a default judgment of more than $1.07 billion against Byju Raveendran, after finding that the edtech founder repeatedly failed to comply with court-ordered discovery in the Byju’s Alpha adversary proceeding.A default judgment is a ruling issued when a party does not participate in the litigation or ignores court orders, allowing the court to decide the case without a trial.The ruling, issued on November 20 and reviewed by TOI, awards $533 million in damages for what the court described as fraudulent transfer of Byju’s Alpha’s funds in 2022, and another $540.6 million tied to the transfer of the debtor’s interest in Camshaft Capital Fund, a US hedge fund.The court also ordered Raveendran to provide a “full and accurate accounting” of the Alpha Funds and any proceeds that flowed from subsequent transactions.Judge Brendan Shannon wrote that the relief granted was “extraordinary” but justified, citing what he called an “extensive and repeated pattern of delay and obfuscation.”The order recounts multiple missed deadlines, incomplete filings, non-appearances, and non-payment of earlier sanctions, including a $10,000-per-day fine imposed in July for civil contempt.The adversary case was brought by Byju’s Alpha Inc., the US unit currently in Chapter 11 bankruptcy, along with GLAS Trust, the loan agent that now controls the debtor.They allege that more than half a billion dollars was “spirited away” from the company and routed through various entities beyond the reach of creditors. Raveendran has denied wrongdoing in earlier filings and has argued that discovery requests were improper or unnecessary; the court rejected those objections.The judgment comes alongside a separate filing earlier this week in which the bankruptcy estate submitted a sworn declaration from UK businessman Oliver Chapman, describing how the disputed funds allegedly moved through his firm, OCI Limited, before being routed to a Singapore entity the debtor claims was linked to Raveendran.That motion seeks court approval for a settlement with Chapman and marks the most detailed account yet submitted to the court on the alleged movement of the Alpha Funds.",The Delaware Bankruptcy Court has entered a default judgment of more than $1.07 billion against Byju Raveendran.

Changes for workers

A new chapter for India's labour ecosystem

In a landmark move set to reshape India's labour landscape, govt notified the implementation of all four labour codes, bringing into effect one of the most ambitious labour reforms in the country's post-independence history.The rollout marks the realisation of ""One India, One Law""- a unified labour framework that replaces a century of fragmented statutes with a consolidated, modern regulatory system. The four legislations cover various aspects of wages, social security, occupational safety, health and working conditions and employee relations aspects.Together, these codes subsume 29 central labour laws into a single legal structure aimed at improving transparency, reducing compliance complexity and enabling uniformity across states.Under the earlier system, overlapping definitions, varying state amendments and multiple registrations created operational hurdles for both employers and workers. The new framework introduces standardised definitions, rationalised thresholds and digitised processes intended to streamline compliance across the country.While the codes are now in force nationwide, supporting rules under both central and state jurisdictions are still to be notified.The press release issued by govt clarifies that they would engage with the public and stakeholders in the development of rules, regulations, and schemes under the new codes.Additionally, to ease the transition, the release confirms that the relevant provisions of existing labour laws will remain in force during the transition period.The implementation of the labour codes will fundamentally reshape workforce management across industries. By introducing a uniform definition of wages, organisations will face greater clarity in benefit calculations for gratuity, ESI, leave encashment, overtime and statutory bonus, reducing litigation risk but potentially increasing employment costs. This change demands a thorough review of salary structures and payroll systems to ensure compliance.Additionally, the broader definition of 'worker' will extend entitlements such as overtime, leave encashment, and retrenchment compensation to a wider employee base, requiring companies to reassess classifications and related policies.For workers-particularly those in the unorganised, gig and platform sectors-the reforms mark an unprecedented expansion of protections. The code on wages ensures a statutory minimum wage for all categories of workers and prohibits gender-based wage discrimination. The Social Security Code extends benefits to gig workers, platform workers and fixed-term employees for the first time. A national database of unorganised workers and a dedicated Social Security Fund aim to enable targeted delivery of welfare benefits.The OSH Code enhances workplace safety norms, regulates working conditions and ensures portability of benefits for migrant workers.The enforcement of the labour codes marks a pivotal moment in India's economic reform journey. If implemented effectively, the unified framework promises greater transparency, stronger worker protections and a more predictable regulatory environment for businesses. While final state rules and clarifications are awaited, Friday's notification marks the beginning of a new chapter - one where India's labour laws, finally, speak in a single, coherent voice.(The writer is partner, people advisory services - tax, EY India)","The rollout marks the realisation of ""One India, One Law""- a unified labour framework that replaces a century of fragmented statutes.

For the garment industry, grappling with competition from Bangladesh, Vietnam and Sri Lanka, permission to hire women in night shifts has been a long ask, he added.For IT workers, govt flagged that salaries have to be paid by the seventh of every month and equal pay for equal work. “Nasscom will work closely with all stakeholders to help industry navigate this change with confidence,” said the industry body.“The codes enhance industry competitiveness through single registration, reduced overlap, and streamlined processes, while ensuring minimum wages for all, improved OSH standards, annual health check-ups, maternity and social-security protections, and safer night-shift opportunities for women,” said Ficci director general Jyoti Vij.Industry bodies also recognised the flexibility it provides. “This long-awaited reform brings India in line with global standards, eases compliance, empowers enterprises, and strengthens the foundations for higher productivity, greater competitiveness and accelerated job creation,” said CII director general Chandrajit Banerjee.","India Inc will have to significantly alter the way it does business to comply with the new provisions.

"Finally, gig workers have pan-India social security",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/finally-gig-workers-have-pan-india-social-security/articleshow/125497254.cms,"MUMBAI: In a major boost to gig workers, the Centre’s move to implement the social security code will not just help those working with online platforms but also others to access benefits.Following budget announcement, some 15 lakh workers linked to online platforms are already registered on the labour ministry’s e-shram portal but the numbers are going to swell soon as the likes of Eternal, Swiggy, Uber, Ola and Urban Company will now have to earmark 1-2% of their annual turnover towards welfare funds for gig workers in line with the provisions of the new labour codes.The allocation, however, has been capped at 5% of the amount paid or payable to the workers. Under the codes, gig or platform workers have been defined for the first time in a boost to over seven million such workers affiliated to digital platforms who until now were not covered under any law.“While some states such as Karnataka and Rajasthan were seeking to provide social security to gig workers, the Social Security Code will now ensure nationwide coverage,” said Kajol Pokkhriyal, member, employment and HR laws practice at law firm Nishith Desai Associates.“Millions of gig workers now have portable benefits, health coverage, and social security that enables mobility across states and jobs. They now have rights to get mandatory appointment letters, accident insurance, disability protection among others. In addition, the reform addresses their financial invisibility by extending portable provident fund contributions, pension eligibility regardless of employer continuity, access to affordable credit through formal records among others,” said Rishi Agrawal, co-founder & CEO at TeamLease RegTech.The number of gig workers is estimated to grow to 23.5 million by 2029-30 from 7.7 million in 2020-21, an official release said last year. Expansion of online platforms and growing adoption of digital services have created job opportunities for scores of low-skilled people and unemployed youth.The codes also provide for accident compensation and accidents occurring while travelling between home and workplace will now be treated as employment-related accidents.All gig workers will now get social security coverage. “As such, aggregators who consider gig and platform workers engaged by them as independent contractors and do not provide social security benefits on this basis will now be required to provide such benefits to such workers,” said Minu Dwivedi, partner, JSA Advocates & Solicitors.“For the first time, the Code on Social Security, 2020 formally recognises gig workers, and aggregators, ensuring their inclusion in India’s social protection architecture,” said Shaik Salauddin, co-founder and national general secretary at Indian Federation of App-Based Transport Workers (IFAT) and founder president, Telangana Gig and Platform Workers Union, which has been at the forefront of several protests demanding better pay and working conditions for gig workers.In a statement, Uber India said that it will work closely with the govt to ensure the speedy and effective implementation of these reforms. Rapido said that it is reviewing the notification. “Strengthening social security for gig and platform workers is vital for long-term resilience and inclusion,” the company said in a statement. Eternal, Swiggy, Urban Company and Zepto did not respond to queries until press time.

Only 6 out of 46 EV models make cut for PLI scheme,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/only-6-out-of-46-ev-models-make-cut-for-pli-scheme/articleshow/125497242.cms,"NEW DELHI: The China factor continues to weigh heavily on India's emerging electric car market as the domestic supply chain for green cars is inadequate in key areas such as batteries, semiconductors and magnets.Consider this: of the 46 EV models sold in the country, only six - around 13% - have been found eligible for benefits under the production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme of govt as they meet the domestic value-add (DVA) mandates.The rest were marked ineligible for PLI as they carried imported content more than the stipulated levels with the vast part of components coming in from China, sources told TOI.The incentives are given out by the ministry of heavy industries (MHI), and the criteria for allotting PLI is that a model needs to have at least 50% local content in its composition (a relaxation on import of battery cells takes the DVA cut-off lower to 40%).""The six approved models include five cars from Tata Motors and one from Mahindra. All the other models sold in the market, including from companies such as JSW MG, BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Hyundai, Kia, Citroen, VinFast, Volvo, Tesla and Audi, have over 60% imported content,"" one of the sources said.The EV models that have made the cut are - Tata Nexon, Tata Punch and Tata Harrier SUVs, Tata Tiago hatch, and Tata Tigor sedan, apart from Mahindra XEV9E.Tata's Curvv EV and Mahindra BE6 green also did not meet PLI's local value-add criteria, despite other models from the companies making the cut.Officials from companies whose models did not make the cut said that meeting the DVA criteria at such a nascent stage of EV adoption remains challenging.""The local supply ecosystem for EVs is still not as evolved as it is in the internal-combustion engine (ICE) category. Also, with limited sales of the greens, it is quite challenging and practically unviable to ask our supply chain partners to come to India,"" said a top functionary at a leading European automaker.So what are the parts that are being imported for the EVs?

"With an eye on export market, India to establish a national digital traceability system for fisheries, aquaculture",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/with-an-eye-on-export-market-india-to-establish-centralised-digital-traceability-system-for-fisheries-aquaculture/articleshow/125491805.cms,".

NEW DELHI: With India targeting to scale up its seafood exports to Rs 1 lakh crore by 2030, the govt on World Fisheries Day on Friday released a framework to establish a national digital traceability system for fisheries and aquaculture to ensure compliance with international regulations, promote food safety and improve market access.The move will help India expand its export markets for fisheries in the wake of imposition of high tariff by the US on Indian shrimp and other marine products. India’s seafood exports amounted to Rs 62,408 crore in 2024-25 with a substantial amount of it coming from the shrimp export.Since the framework will facilitate enhanced transparency and robust quality assurance, the marine commodity can easily be accepted in other markets as it will enable real-time, end-to-end tracking of seafood products from ‘farm to plate’ and ‘catch to consumer’ — an essential requirement in many countries.The framework, released by the department of fisheries, outlines a comprehensive strategy to unify fragmented traceability practices by integrating digital tools such as blockchain, IoT, QR codes and GPS, while ensuring inclusivity for small-scale fishers and farmers.Though the impending trade deal with the US is expected to soften the tariff burden to an extent, meeting of international regulations on quality, sustainability and traceability will improve the ability of Indian processors to divert their shrimp exports to alternative markets such as Russia, China, the UK and other European countries through dealing with non-tariff barriers.In his recorded video message on the occasion, Union minister Rajiv Ranjan Singh, highlighted the importance of strengthening traceability, branding, and biosecurity to align with global benchmarks. He said the launch of the framework is a transformative milestone that will bolster seafood exports and help secure better returns for fishers.According to an estimate, India’s shrimp export volume is set to fall 15-18 per cent this fiscal following the US decision to raise import tariffs on the commodity to more than 50% from Aug 27.Speaking on the occasion, Abhilaksh Likhi, secretary, department of fisheries, emphasized upon the govt’s focus on value addition, diversification and regulatory compliance to establish India as a leading global seafood processing hub.Currently, India with its extensive coastline and vast inland water resources is the second-largest fish-producing country in the world, accounting for nearly 8 per cent of the global fish output. Between 2013–14 and 2024–25, India’s total fish production more than doubled, increasing from 96 lakh tonnes to 195 lakh tonnes, with inland fisheries registering an impressive 140 per cent growth during this period.The sector serves as a key driver of India’s blue economy, sustaining over 30 million livelihoods. Coastal states and Union Territories, which include around 3,477 coastal fishing villages, produce 72 per cent of the country’s total fish production and account for 76 per cent of India’s total seafood exports.","India targeting to scale up its seafood exports to Rs 1 lakh crore by 2030.

NEW DELHI: The national capital woke up to dense smog on Monday, with the average Air Quality Index (AQI) at 359 at 7 am — classified as 'very poor' — despite the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP)-III being in effect across Delhi and the National Capital Region (NCR), according to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB).A thick layer of smog continued to blanket Delhi on Monday, showing little improvement from Sunday’s AQI of 385.Bawana recorded the highest pollution level at 427, falling under the ‘severe’ category, while NSIT Dwarka reported the lowest at 225, according to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB).Iconic areas like India Gate and Kartavya Path were shrouded in toxic smog, with AQI readings of 341 (‘very poor’). Other hotspots included Chandni Chowk (383), RK Puram (366), ITO (394), Punjabi Bagh (384), Patparganj (369), Pusa (365), and Dwarka Sector-8 (356).Meanwhile, Anand Vihar remained engulfed in a layer of toxic smog, with the CPCB reporting an AQI of 383, classified as ‘very poor’.The thick smog, along with deteriorating air quality, mercury continued to hover around the 9 Degree Celsius mark, with some areas recording even lower temperatures.As per CPCB classification, an AQI between 0-50 is considered 'good', 51-100 'satisfactory', 101-200 'moderate', 201-300 'poor', 301-400 'very poor', and 401-500 'severe'.Following the deteriorating air quality in the national capital, the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) III was implemented on November 11 across Delhi by the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM). The measures aim to control emissions through stricter restrictions on construction, vehicular movement and industrial operations.Under GRAP-III, restrictions include a ban on most non-essential construction, limits on BS-III petrol and BS-IV diesel vehicles, suspension of in-person classes for students up to Class 5 with a shift to online or hybrid learning, curbs on industries using non-clean fuels, and a ban on non-emergency diesel generators.Earlier, the Supreme Court directed the governments of Punjab and Haryana to file a status report on the measures taken to curb stubble burning, which contributes to the air pollution crisis in the Delhi-NCR region.A bench of Chief Justice of India BR Gavai and Justice K Vinod Chandran ordered, ""We direct the state of Punjab and Haryana to file a report on what steps are being taken to curb stubble burning.""Since Diwali, air quality in Delhi and the NCR has remained in the 'very poor' to 'severe' categories in several areas, despite Stage III of the GRAP being in effect.","The national capital woke up to dense smog on Monday, with the average Air Quality Index (AQI) at 359 at 7 am.

Corporate crypto holdings under pressure

Bitcoin and ether tumbled to multi-month lows on Friday as investors pulled back from riskier assets amid concerns over stretched tech valuations and fading expectations of near-term US rate cuts, Reuters reported.Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency , dropped 5.5% to a seven-month low of $81,668, while ether slid more than 6% to $2,661.37, hitting a four-month low.Both tokens have fallen roughly 12% this week, erasing Bitcoin’s year-to-date gains and pulling ether nearly 19% lower for the year.The sell-off comes as volatility spikes across equity markets, particularly high-flying artificial intelligence stocks. Analysts said the retreat signals a broader shift away from speculative assets. “If it’s telling a story about risk sentiment as a whole, then things could start to get really, really ugly, and that’s the concern now,” said Tony Sycamore, market analyst at IG, according to Reuters.The market value of all cryptocurrencies has dropped by about $1.2 trillion in six weeks, CoinGecko data showed. Shares of Hong Kong-listed spot bitcoin ETFs from China AMC, Harvest and Bosera fell close to 7% on Friday.Bitcoin’s fall follows a rally earlier this year that pushed it above $120,000 in October, driven by favourable regulatory developments. However, analysts say last month’s record one-day crash — which triggered $19 billion in liquidations — has left sentiment fragile. “The market feels a little bit dislocated, a bit fractured, a bit broken,” Sycamore said, quoted Reuters.Citi analyst Alex Saunders noted that $80,000 is a key level because it is close to the average purchase price of ETF-held bitcoin.The downturn has dragged crypto-linked stocks lower.

Japan currently finds itself stuck between a rock and a hard place. On the geopolitical front, Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi’s hawkish stance linking Taiwan’s security to Japan’s own has ruffled feathers in Beijing. China has already fired back with economic warnings—from freezing film approvals to squeezing seafood imports—signaling that Tokyo is in a delicate diplomatic bind.But the real storm is brewing at home. In a bid to soothe a public weary of inflation, the government is unleashing a massive stimulus package worth ¥21.3 trillion (roughly $135 billion). While the cash injection might help voters, it’s rattling a bond market that was already on edge. With the Bank of Japan (BoJ) stepping back and interest rates creeping up, bond yields are hitting levels not seen since the 2008 financial crisis.This marks the end of the ultra-loose monetary policy that defined Japan for decades. Now, analysts are asking the uncomfortable question: Can the world’s most indebted nation manage its towering debt without breaking something in the global financial system?Here is an explainer on why Japan’s bond market has suddenly become the world's biggest worry.Simply put, Japanese Government Bond (JGB) yields are breaking out. The 10-year yield recently flirted with 1.8%—a high water mark not seen since 2008—while the 30-year yield pushed past 3.3%. For a country where ""zero interest"" was the status quo for a generation, this is a seismic shift.Why it matters: Japan isn't just any economy; it is the world’s largest creditor nation. Japanese investors have trillions of dollars parked in global assets, from US Treasuries to Australian real estate. If domestic bonds suddenly offer a decent return, that money might pack its bags and head back to Tokyo. This repatriation of capital could drain liquidity from markets like the US and India, causing ripple effects everywhere.Japan’s debt-to-GDP ratio has sat around 230% for years without causing a crisis. The difference today is the timing.The government is launching a massive ¥21.3 trillion spending spree to fight inflation exactly when the central bank is trying to stop buying so many bonds. Usually, central banks buy bonds to keep yields low; with the BoJ stepping back, the market has to absorb this new debt, pushing yields up.As Mizuho’s Saori Tsuiki noted, the sheer size of the stimulus sends a risky message. If the market believes the government has lost its fiscal discipline, investors might discount the economic benefits entirely, leaving Japan with just the debt and none of the growth.For decades, shorting Japanese bonds (betting that yields would rise) was nicknamed the ""widow-maker"" trade. Traders who tried it got wiped out because the Bank of Japan had an unlimited checkbook to keep yields at zero.But the widow-maker has finally woken up. Over the last year, the BoJ has:As Bloomberg put it, we are watching a market that was artificially engineered by a central bank trying to learn how to be a ""normal"" market again. The safety net is gone.The carry trade was the financial world’s favorite free lunch. Investors borrowed yen cheaply (because Japanese rates were zero), converted it to dollars, and bought higher-yielding assets like US stocks or Indian bonds.However, as Japanese yields rise, two things happen:This destroys the profit margin of the trade. Investors are now forced to sell their foreign assets to pay back their yen loans—a process called ""unwinding."" This is why a small rate hike in Tokyo can trigger a massive sell-off in the S&P 500.The ""bond vigilantes"" are spotting cracks in the foundation. Recent auctions for long-term bonds (20 to 40 years) have seen weak demand, a clear sign that investors are hesitant to lend to the government long-term.Investors know that defense spending and social security costs are only going up. S&P Global Ratings analyst Rain Yin pointed out that Japan faces undeniable spending pressure on these fronts. If the government has to issue record amounts of debt to pay for it, and there are fewer buyers, yields have nowhere to go but up.If yields keep rising, it creates a nasty feedback loop:Yes, and that is exactly why economists are raising eyebrows.The government claims it is trying to thread a needle—supporting the economy without fueling inflation. But pouring cash into an economy struggling with high prices usually just fans the flames. Yuichi Kodama of Meiji Yasuda suggests this might be political theater: the spending is likely a way for the Takaichi administration to show they care about the public’s struggle, even if it risks spooking the markets.India is in the blast radius. If Japanese yields become attractive, Japanese funds might pull capital out of Indian bonds and equities. Furthermore, as the ""carry trade"" unwinds, global investors tend to go ""risk-off,"" pulling money out of emerging markets to cover their losses elsewhere. This often leads to volatility in the rupee and Indian stock indices.Is this the big crash, or just a return to normalcy? There are three main views:Most analysts expect a mix of all three. But one thing is certain: the days of ignoring Japan’s bond market are over. It has gone from a predictable sleeper to a source of potential global volatility.","Japanese bond yields are hitting levels not seen since the 2008 financial crisis. The 10-year yield recently flirted with 1.8%, while the 30-year yields pushed past 3.3%. This marks the end of the ultra-loose monetary policy that defined Japan for decades.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125489670,imgsize-1350142,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"
Nvidia chip smuggling: Four charged in US over illegal exports to China; lawmakers urge stricter rules,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/nvidia-chip-smuggling-four-charged-in-us-over-illegal-exports-to-china-lawmakers-urge-stricter-rules/articleshow/125488914.cms,"Representative image

Defendants, charges and alleged methods



Legislative response and strategic concerns



The US justice department has charged four individuals in a scheme to illegally export Nvidia AI chips to China, highlighting challenges in enforcing US high-tech export restrictions.The indictment, unsealed Thursday in US district court in Tampa, Florida, accuses two US citizens and two Chinese nationals of conspiring to ship Nvidia GPUs without required licenses, using fake contracts and false documentation to disguise shipments through Malaysia and Thailand.According to court documents, 400 Nvidia A100 GPUs were successfully exported to China between October 2024 and January 2025, while attempts to export 10 Hewlett-Packard supercomputers with H100 GPUs and 50 H200 GPUs were stopped by law enforcement, reported CNBC.The scheme allegedly used a Tampa company, Janford Realtor, as a front for the transactions, funded with nearly $4 million in wire transfers from China.One defendant, Brian Curtis Raymond, 46, from Huntsville, Alabama, is identified as the former CTO of an AI cloud company in Virginia, which confirmed he is no longer employed there, reported CNBC.Raymond, along with co-defendant Mathew Ho (Hon Ning Ho), 34, a US citizen born in Hong Kong, allegedly coordinated the shipments, knowing the chips would ultimately be sent to China.Two other defendants, Jing (Harry) Chen, 45, and Tony Li, 38, both Chinese nationals, are also charged.Charges include conspiracy to violate the Export Control Reform Act (ECRA), smuggling, and multiple counts of money laundering related to the $3.4–$4 million in wire transfers.Raymond faces seven money laundering counts and additional ECRA violations; Ho faces nine money laundering counts, four ECRA violations, and three smuggling counts.Chen and Li face conspiracy, ECRA violations, and smuggling charges. All four could face up to 20 years in prison if convicted.The case has renewed calls from US lawmakers for stricter chip-tracking legislation.John Moolenaar, chair of the House Select Committee on China, stressed the need for the bipartisan Chip Security Act, which would mandate chip location verification and reporting of potential diversions.“China recognises the superiority of American AI innovation and will do whatever it must to catch up. That’s why the bipartisan Chip Security Act is urgently needed,” he said, as per Reuters.The indictment underlines the strategic importance of AI and supercomputing chips, which US export curbs aim to prevent from aiding China’s military and technological advancements.The justice department noted that China is actively developing exascale supercomputing capabilities and plans to become a global AI leader by 2030.","The indictment, unsealed Thursday in US district court in Tampa, Florida, accuses two US citizens and two Chinese nationals of conspiring to ship Nvidia GPUs without required licenses.

'They Love Us Again': Trump Hints At Trade Deal With India, Lowering Of Tariffs Amid Strain In Ties

Tariffs drag down port traffic



Forecasts turn bleak as demand weakens

The US transport and logistics industry is continuing to feel the strain of President Donald Trump’s tariff regime, with major ports reporting a steep fall in inbound cargo after months of record traffic.For the first time this year, October rates for van, flatbed and refrigerated loads declined on both monthly and annual terms, according to the DAT Truckload Volume Index.As per CNBC, Ken Adamo, DAT’s chief of analytics, said the third-quarter and October slowdown mirrored trends across the wider goods economy, with companies using up stockpiles created earlier to cushion tariff risks and softer demand.“As a result, the traditional peak holiday shipping season looks virtually non-existent this year,” he said.Van loads dropped 3% from September and 11% year on year, refrigerated freight dipped 2% and 7% respectively, while flatbed loads fell 4% month on month and 3% annually.Government data released after a lengthy shutdown showed that US imports in August fell by $18.4 billion compared with July as fresh tariffs took effect, contributing to the trade deficit shrinking by more than 23%, reported CNBC.The Port of Long Beach said Chinese imports to the US are down 16%, with CEO Mario Cordero calling the decline “across the board.”Neighbouring Los Angeles also recorded weaker volumes in October.Sectors hit hardest include electronics, furniture and toys, while US grain exports have suffered as China shifted soybean purchases to Brazil during the trade dispute.Though China later agreed to buy more US soybeans, earlier frontloading by retailers and manufacturers—done to avoid shifting tariff deadlines—had already inflated West Coast container numbers earlier in the year.Despite overall West Coast volumes still showing a year-on-year rise of 10% and China–West Coast shipments increasing 4.6%, Vizion data shows a darker outlook.The firm’s vice president, Ben Tracy, expects US imports in December to fall 16.6% year on year after a 12% drop in the third quarter. “There is no bounce back in sight,” he said, as quoted by CNBC.Vizion CEO Kyle Henderson added that import levels have consistently slipped below 2 million TEUs for the first time since March 2023, calling it a “structural goods recession” driven by tariff uncertainty, a stalled housing market and consumers shifting away from physical goods.“When furniture imports collapse 33 percent and toy imports … barely rise 17 percent that tells you retailers are betting on the weakest consumer season in years,” he said.Container utilisation has also slid from 100% to 91%.Arrivals scheduled for December stand at 2.19 million TEUs, down from 2.62 million the previous year—a reduction of over 430,000 TEUs that is now filtering through rail, trucking, warehousing and port labour.Cordero said the slowdown was already raising concerns among longshore workers. “When you have reduced volume, you’re going to have an impact on the jobs in the supply chain,” he said.The International Longshoremen’s Association, which receives yearly bonuses tied to volumes moved, is among those affected.Tariffs on India have severely weakened the freight market on that route, with the Global Trade Research Initiative estimating a 37.5% drop in Indian export value to the US from May to September 2025, with Indian goods now facing a 50% tariff.","Major ports report steep fall in inbound cargo after months of record traffic.

China 'Schools' Trump's Treasury Chief On Rare Earths Leverage Claims | 'Threats Won't Solve...'

Greenland becomes a focal point

Race extends to Arctic Sweden

A worldwide rush to tap the Arctic’s resources is accelerating as countries look for alternatives to China’s stronghold over strategic minerals.Melting ice and improving access have drawn renewed interest to the largely undeveloped polar region, which is increasingly viewed as a potential source of rare earths, base metals and new trade routes, as per CNBC.US President Donald Trump has repeatedly highlighted the strategic value of Greenland, describing U.S. control of the territory as an “absolute necessity” for both economic and security reasons.Canada has also stepped up investment in the region amid strained ties with Washington, while Moscow continues to position itself as a major Arctic power. Russian President Vladimir Putin recently praised the launch of a new nuclear-powered icebreaker, saying it remains important “to consistently strengthen Russia’s position” in the Arctic.Marc Lanteigne of the Arctic University of Norway was quoted by CNBC as saying that the region is now being seen as a source of “strategic materials and rare earths,” noting that Greenland contains “base metals, precious metals, gem stones, rare earths, uranium … it’s all there.”As per CNBC, climate change has reshaped parts of Greenland, exposing areas previously covered by ice. A study by the University of Leeds found some of the island’s glaciers and ice sheet have given way to wetlands, shrubs and bare rock, making certain minerals more accessible to companies.Tony Sage, CEO of Critical Metals, was cited by CNBC as saying that he had seen rising investor interest in Greenland, particularly since Trump returned to office. The firm is developing large rare earth assets in the south of the island.Another firm, Amaroq, has also reported major discoveries. CEO Eldur Olafsson described the company’s recent find of high-grade rare earths as significant and said its confirmation of commercial quantities of germanium and gallium could be even more important. “The germanium, gallium piece is, in my opinion, much bigger news than people understand,” he said, according to CNBC.Both metals are used extensively in electronics, electric vehicles and defence technologies. China imposed export controls on these metals in 2023 before later suspending its ban on shipments to the US, though restrictions remain.Olafsson said Amaroq’s near-term plan involves generating cashflow from zinc, lead, silver and germanium and gallium, while progressing its rare earths projects. He added that the rare earths market remains relatively small and must be approached cautiously.Despite the growing excitement, Lanteigne said that expectations often exceed reality.Even under favourable conditions, he said it could take 15 to 20 years for Arctic mining ventures in places like Greenland to turn a “serious profit,” citing logistical issues, harsh weather and the need to construct entire supply chains in remote areas.Interest is not limited to Greenland. Sweden is moving to develop one of Europe’s largest known rare earth deposits in the Per Geijer area near Kiruna.State-owned LKAB, which operates a major iron ore mine there, is now in discussions with European policymakers to ensure the project is viable.Niklas Johansson of LKAB said that while key materials have already been extracted to the surface through existing mining operations, profitability is not guaranteed.“It looks like it is for us at the moment, but it’s not something that you’d say, ‘oh it’s a no brainer,’” he said, noting the challenges would be even greater for companies without established infrastructure.","Melting ice and improving access have drawn renewed interest to the largely undeveloped polar region.

Donald Trump Signals Harsh Sanctions On Russia’s Trading Partners With India On List For Oil Trade

The Congressional Budget Office has lowered its projection of how much President Donald Trump’s tariff increases will reduce US budget deficits over the next decade.The non-partisan agency now expects the duties to cut deficits by $3 trillion through 2035, down from the $4 trillion estimated in August, as per news agency Reuters.According to the latest assessment, all tariffs imposed between January 6 and November 15 would reduce primary deficits by $2.5 trillion if maintained until 2035.Lower government borrowing would save an additional $500 billion in interest payments. The CBO said the revision was largely the result of newly available data, with the rest reflecting recent tariff adjustments by the administration.CBO director Philip Swagel said “roughly two-thirds of the downward revisions” were due to updated figures, while changes to tariff rates since August also affected the outlook, reported Bloomberg.Some US courts have ruled the administration exceeded its authority in imposing the duties, with the Supreme Court now reviewing those decisions. Critics have argued that tariff costs are ultimately borne by consumers, while Trump has maintained the measures have created a financial gain for the Treasury.As per Bloomberg, the CBO’s new projection means expected tariff revenue would not fully offset the government’s earlier assessment that Trump’s tax-cut law would add $3.4 trillion to deficits over 10 years.The agency also said it now estimates the effective tariff rate to be around 14 percentage points above last year’s level, compared with an 18-point rise estimated in August.The adjustment follows a series of trade deals and rate reductions intended to curb price increases on certain goods.As per Axios, the revised projection returns the CBO’s estimate to its June level, after it had been raised in August. Axios also reported that more than a third of US imports are now unaffected by tariff changes introduced this year.The White House, in a statement cited by Axios, said the tariffs would generate “trillions in revenue,” claiming foreign exporters would bear the costs.Trump has continued to promote the idea of $2,000 “tariff dividend” cheques, although many lawmakers prefer using the revenue to narrow deficits.Any ruling by the Supreme Court against key tariff actions would alter revenue expectations, though economists expect the administration would attempt to reintroduce the duties through other means, as per Bloomberg.","The Congressional Budget Office has lowered its projection of how much President Donald Trump’s tariff increases will reduce US budget deficits over the next decade.

"‘To advance US energy dominance’: Trump admin unveils offshore drilling plan; California, Florida waters targeted",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/to-advance-us-energy-dominance-trump-admin-unveils-offshore-drilling-plan-california-florida-waters-targeted/articleshow/125475431.cms,"Image source: X/@SecretaryBurgum



The Donald Trump administration on Thursday unveiled a sweeping offshore oil and gas leasing proposal that would open waters off California, Florida and Alaska to new drilling, reversing restrictions imposed during former US President Joe Biden’s presidency. The draft schedule, detailed in a new Interior Department plan, was described by Politico as the most expansive federal offshore leasing push in decades.The Department of the Interior issued a new Secretary’s Order directing the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management to end the Biden administration’s 2024–2029 National Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Gas Leasing Programme and replace it with a far broader 2026–2031 plan. According to BOEM, the draft proposal includes up to 34 potential offshore lease sales across 1.27 billion acres, covering 21 areas off Alaska, seven in the Gulf of Mexico and six along the Pacific coast.“Offshore oil and gas production does not happen overnight. It takes years of planning, investment, and hard work before barrels reach the market,” Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum said. “The Biden administration slammed the brakes on offshore oil and gas leasing and crippled the long-term pipeline of America’s offshore production.By moving forward with a robust, forward-thinking leasing plan, we are ensuring that America’s offshore industry stays strong, workers stay employed, and the nation remains energy dominant for decades to come. ”The proposal would open areas that have not seen drilling in decades or have never been developed. The administration argues the expansion is necessary to meet the nation’s “growing energy needs.” It replaces a Biden-era programme that includes only three scheduled sales between 2024 and 2029. Politico reported that the new plan includes lease sales off the California coast, the eastern Gulf of Mexico and Arctic waters off Alaska, including previously untouched parts of the High Arctic.The announcement triggered immediate political resistance. California Governor Gavin Newsom called the plan “dead on arrival,” according to Axios, with state officials warning of threats to ecosystems, tourism and fisheries. The Washington Post noted that Florida has long opposed drilling near its shoreline and that the Deepwater Horizon disaster had a lasting impact on the state, leading lawmakers to resist similar proposals during Trump’s first term.The Washington Post also reported that California officials pointed to the legacy of the 1969 Santa Barbara oil spill and argued there is no national need for expanded drilling. They added that the region lacks the infrastructure to support a major offshore push and that state regulators would oppose new terminals and pipelines.Environmental groups also criticised the proposal. “The people of these states have been clear that they don’t want this off their coasts,” a Natural Resources Defense Council official said, as quoted by Axios.According to the Washington Post, more than 100 members of Congress have urged the administration to drop the plan, warning of environmental and economic risks.","The Donald Trump administration on Thursday unveiled a sweeping offshore oil and gas leasing proposal.

Asian equities slumped on Friday as renewed fears around overstretched tech valuations and ambiguous US jobs data pulled investors sharply away from risk assets.The downturn came despite Nvidia’s blockbuster earnings earlier in the week, which had briefly revived confidence in the strength of the AI sector.According to news agency AFP, concerns over an AI-driven market bubble resurfaced quickly, with tech majors across Asia leading the sell-off.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang attempted to calm nerves, insisting during the company’s latest update that, “From our vantage point, we see something very different,” but the reassurance offered only temporary relief.Markets across Tokyo, Hong Kong, Seoul, Sydney and Taipei tumbled between 1.6% and 3.2%, as per AFP, with chipmakers absorbing the worst damage.Samsung Electronics plunged nearly five per cent, SK hynix more than nine per cent, and Taiwan’s TSMC slid almost four per cent. SoftBank also crashed over 10% in Tokyo.The shift in sentiment followed a sharp reversal on Wall Street. While US equities initially rose on Nvidia’s results, the rally collapsed after fresh labour data showed job gains in September but also a rise in the unemployment rate — a combination offering little clarity on the Fed’s near-term rate path.As per Reuters, futures now imply a 40% probability of a December rate cut.US futures now imply a 40% chance of a December cut, compared with 30% a day earlier.MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan sank 1.8%, taking weekly losses to 3% — the steepest drop since April.Analysts said the market’s fragility was clear, with investors dumping positions even in response to neutral or mildly positive news.Currencies also reacted sharply. The yen briefly firmed after Japan’s finance minister signalled possible intervention against speculative trading, though it remained near a 10-month low around 157.40 per dollar, as per Reuters.Japanese bond yields stayed elevated as traders awaited a stimulus package reportedly worth more than $130 billion.Bitcoin slid below $93,000 for the first time since April, extending a sharp retreat from last month’s record high above $126,200.Oil prices extended their decline for a third session. Brent slipped to $62.67 a barrel and WTI to $58.29.As per Reuters, market sentiment turned bearish as Washington pushed for a Russia-Ukraine peace deal that could bring more crude to market, while a stronger dollar added pressure.Both benchmarks are on track for weekly drops of more than 2% amid oversupply worries.","Tokyo, Hong Kong, Seoul, Sydney and Taipei tumbled between 1.6% and 3.2%.

Unemployment concerns



Wage growth steady but unlikely to sway Fed

Job market in 2025



Revisions show major overestimate



Next full jobs report pushed to December



The United States finally released its long-awaited September employment data after a seven-week delay caused by the federal government shutdown, showing that employers added 119,000 jobs, more than twice what economists had expected.Though the figure offered a bright headline after weeks of uncertainty, the underlying numbers painted an uneven picture of the job market.Revisions to earlier months caused immediate concern. The labour department reported that August had in fact recorded a loss of 4,000 jobs, a sharp reversal from the previously reported 22,000 gain.Combined revisions for July and August removed 33,000 jobs from earlier estimates.June had already shown job losses, marking the first time since the 2020 pandemic that two months in a row had turned negative.The release of the figures was closely watched by businesses, investors and the Federal Reserve, which had been without official labour data during the 43-day shutdown. The report arrives at a time when the economy is balancing the effects of high interest rates and uncertainty surrounding Donald Trump’s push for broad new taxes on imports from nearly every country.Much of the hiring in September came from a narrow base. Healthcare and social assistance roles accounted for more than 57,000 of the jobs added, while leisure and hospitality, particularly restaurants and bars, contributed about 37,000.Construction firms added 19,000 positions and retailers nearly 14,000. Meanwhile, manufacturers shed another 6,000 jobs, extending their losing streak to a fifth month, and the federal government cut 3,000 positions for the eighth month running.“We've got these strong headline numbers, but when you look underneath that you'll see that a lot of that is driven by healthcare,’’ Cory Stahle, senior economist at the Indeed Hiring Lab told AP.“At the end of the day, the question is: Can you support an economic expansion on the back of one industry? Anybody would have a hard time arguing everybody should become a nurse.’’The unemployment rate rose to 4.4% in September, up from 4.3% in August and the highest level since October 2021.The increase was partly due to 470,000 people entering the labour force, either taking jobs or beginning to look for work, and not all were absorbed immediately.Wage growth remained relatively subdued. Average hourly earnings rose by 0.2% from August and 3.8% over the past year, moving nearer to the 3.5% annual pace that the Federal Reserve views as consistent with its inflation goals.The broader jobs landscape in 2025 has been defined by a combination of weak hiring and limited layoffs. Many workers have remained secure in their roles, but jobseekers have faced tougher conditions, with recruitment hampered by high interest rates introduced to counter the inflation spike of 2021–2022 and uncertainty surrounding Trump’s tariff proposals.In September, the Labour Department also reported that the economy created 911,000 fewer jobs than first estimated in the year through March.Employers added an average of just 71,000 jobs a month during that period instead of the 147,000 originally reported. Since March, monthly job gains have slowed further to an average of 59,000.The government confirmed that the October jobs report will not be published in full because shutdown disruptions prevented officials from calculating the unemployment rate. Partial October data will be released alongside the full November report on December 16.","US employers added 119,000 jobs in September, more than twice what economists had expected.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021.

Space sector start-up Sisir Radar to develop SAR on L/P band SAR,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/space-sector-start-up-sisir-radar-to-develop-sar-on-l/p-band-sar/articleshow/104558111.cms,"CHENNAI: Space sector startup, Sisir Radar Private Ltd has hit success at the prestigious iDEX DefSpace Challenge with its projects for development of “L/P band Continuous Wave SAR (synthetic aperture radar) payload for LEO Small Satellites” and “Unfurlable, Electronically Steering Antenna for L/P band SAR payload” for Indian Air Force (IAF), said a top company official.The company is promoted by former Director at the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) Tapan Misra and the brains behind the Indian space agency’s RISAT series of SAR satellites as well as the Dual Frequency SAR on the Chandrayaan 2 orbiter that is currently circling the moon.""A grant of Rs 3 crore is also there for development of the products,"" Misra told IANS.Synthetic Aperture Radar or SAR is a special kind of imaging radar technology that can provide extremely accurate high resolution imagery of the terrain through clouds, smoke and dust even in pitch dark conditions. SAR imagery provides much higher resolution than other forms of remote sensing technology such as hyperspectral and multispectral. SAR is a critical technology for strategic reconnaissance and planning as well as for disaster management.According to Misra, winning the challenge in just over a year of floating the company is a major booster.He said L and P band SAR have an advantage over other frequencies (like X band) when it comes to penetration capabilities through rain, clouds, foliage and vegetation in a tropical country like India, and underground penetration capabilities in dry terrain.Continuing further, he said the L band SAR will provide 1 metre resolution, spotlight resolution in Stripmap mode. The current industry standard is 5-10 metre in L band. Misra said both the L and P band will operate simultaneously from a satellite borne SAR. Recently, Sisir Radar successfully developed and tested the world’s highest resolution L-Band SAR fitted on a drone. With 0.2 metre resolution, this is by far the highest L band SAR in the world, he said.","Space sector startup, Sisir Radar Private Ltd has hit success at the prestigious iDEX DefSpace Challenge.

Explainer: What is 'Hindu rate of growth' and why Raghuram Rajan's remarks may be 'premature',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/explainer-what-is-hindu-rate-of-growth-and-why-raghuram-rajans-remarks-may-be-premature/articleshow/98482598.cms,"What is meant by Hindu growth rate

How India's GDP has been growing

What SBI report said on savings and investment

Incremental capital output ratio

NEW DELHI: India's gross domestic product (GDP) data for the third quarter (October-December 2022) received a word of caution from the former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan In an interview with news agency PTI, Rajan that India is ""dangerously close"" to the Hindu rate of growth in view of subdued private sector investment, high interest rates and slowing global growth.India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying"".However, a report released by the State Bank of India (SBI) economists on Tuesday dismissed arguments that India is dangerously close to Hindu rate of growth saying such statements are ""ill-conceived, biased and premature"".The term 'Hindu growth rate' was coined by late economist Raj Krishna in 1978 to describe the slow growth in the country.It basically refers to the low pace of economic growth rates during 1950s to 1980s. During this period, the Indian economy averaged 3.5%.A former lecturer at the Delhi School of Economics (DSE), Krishna noted that only if the rate of growth is persistently slow and accompanied by low per-capita GDP, then it will be known as Hindu rate of growth but it has to factor in population growth as well.Before economic reforms of 1991, India's economic growth remained stagnant and low, while per capita income averaged around 1.3%.Krishna termed this low growth situation to be a result of socialist policies of state control and import substitution.However, the economic situation changed when liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation (LPG) reforms came into effect in the year 1991, at a time when India faced balance of payment crisis.Over the years, many economists have strongly opposed the idea of 'Hindu growth rate' and the term never had universal acceptance.The Indian economy plunged into its very first technical recession in FY21 due to the impact of Covid-19 pandemic and the related nationwide lockdowns. GDP shrunk by an unprecedented 23.8% in the first quarter of the financial year 2020-21. However, due to spurt in economic activities in the subsequent quarters, the GDP decline started to narrow.However, if we look at the period before Covid-19 as well, India's growth curve shows a declining trend.From 8.26% in FY17, GDP growth plunged to 3.74% in FY20. Shutdown of economic activities in FY21 in wake of Covid-19 only made matters worse.As lockdowns started to ease and business activities resumed, India's GDP also started rising. In Q1 of FY22, growth jumped to 20.1% mainly on account of low base effect. By the fourth quarter of FY22, growth came down to 4.10%.Similarly, the new financial year 2022-23 brought fresh economic challenges in the form of Russia-Ukraine war that impacted almost all major economies of the world, slowed the pace of growth, pushed inflation to record highs.As a result, the central banks of all advanced economies spurred into action and opted for monetary policy tightening to curb the soaring inflation.With persistently rising interest rates, India's economy grew by 4.4% in Q3 of FY23, as the Centre revised upwards GDP growth for previous year to 9.10% from 8.7% earlier.The report weighed recent GDP numbers against the available data on savings and investments for the past decade and highlighted some interesting points.""Quarterly growth numbers are noisy and should be best avoided for any serious interpretation (on an average, India's GDP growth has witnessed Rs 2 lakh crore upward revision for the 3 year ended FY23),"" the report said.Gross capital formation (GCF) by the government touched a high of 11.8% in 2021-22, up from 10.7% in 2020-21.""This also had a domino effect on private sector investment that jumped from 10 per cent to 10.8% over the same period,"" it said.In fact, Ecowrap added that the trends in GCF to gross output ratio or the plough back of funds for creation of fresh capacity shows that for public administration the ratio attained fresh peak in 2021-22 owing to the emphasis on capital expenditure in recent budgets.At the aggregate level, gross capital formation is supposed to have crossed 32% in 2022-23, the highest level since 2018-19.According to the report, in 2021-22, gross savings have risen to 30% from 29% in 2020-21.""The ratio is supposed to have crossed 31 per cent in 2022-23, the highest since 2018-19. The household savings increased sharply during the pandemic period on account of sharp accretion in financial savings such as deposits,"" said the report by SBI's Economic Research Department.While household financial savings have since then moderated from 15.4% in 2020-21 to 11.1% in 2022-23, savings in physical assets have grown sharply to 11.8% in 2021-22 from 10.7% in 2020-21.The report further analysed Incremental Capital Output ratio (ICOR) -- which measures additional units of capital (investment) needed to produce additional units of output. It said that the ratio has been improving.""ICOR which was 7.5 in FY 12 is now only 3.5 in FY22. Clearly, only half of capital is now needed for next unit of output,"" the report noted.Such reducing ICOR in the current years reflects a relatively increasing efficiency of capital and shows that the economy is on a sound footing, the report said.""From that point of view, future GDP growth rates even at 7% could still mean a decent number by any standards!,"" it added.","India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%. Raghuram Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying""","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-98483158,imgsize-65724,width-400,resizemode-4/98483158.jpg"

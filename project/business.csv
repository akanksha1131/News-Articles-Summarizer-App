Disney to lay off hundreds across entertainment divisions amid shift to streaming,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/disney-to-lay-off-hundreds-across-entertainment-divisions-amid-shift-to-streaming/articleshow/121586176.cms,"The Walt Disney Company is cutting several hundred jobs across its film and television divisions, a Disney spokesperson confirmed to USA TODAY. The layoffs, which formally took effect on Monday, June 2, impact departments involved in marketing, publicity, casting, development, and parts of corporate finance. No entire teams are being dissolved, the company said.A Disney representative attributed the decision to the “rapid pace” of industry transformation and the company’s push to “operate more efficiently.”This move is the latest in a series of cost-cutting measures implemented since CEO Bob Iger returned to helm the company in 2022. In early 2023, Iger announced that Disney would lay off 7,000 employees to reduce spending by billions of dollars. That plan has since unfolded through multiple rounds of layoffs.In September 2024, Disney cut around 300 positions in corporate functions such as legal, HR, and communications. Earlier layoffs affected Disney-owned brands including National Geographic, Pixar, and Freeform. In March 2025, the company trimmed another 200 jobs—nearly 6% of its workforce in ABC News and Disney Entertainment Networks.Despite the cuts, Disney reported strong financial results.According to its Q2 2025 earnings report, revenue rose to $23.6 billion, a 7% year-on-year increase. Subscriber numbers for Disney+ also climbed by 126 million in the first quarter, reflecting the accelerating shift in consumer preferences toward streaming platforms.As of its latest fiscal year ending September 2024, Disney employed approximately 233,000 people worldwide.Meanwhile, Disney’s theme parks are also facing challenges. At Walt Disney World in Florida, employees under Temporary Protected Status (TPS) were recently informed they must provide updated work authorization documents or risk being placed on leave. The notification followed a U.S. Supreme Court ruling upholding the Trump-era decision to end TPS protections for about 350,000 Venezuelans.","Disney is cutting several hundred jobs across its film and television divisions.

Asian stocks mixed as tech-led Wall Street rebound offsets tariff anxieties,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/asian-stocks-mixed-as-tech-led-wall-street-rebound-offsets-tariff-anxieties/articleshow/121584272.cms,"Asian equities opened on a cautious note Tuesday, as a rebound in US tech stocks offered modest optimism while investors continued to watch ongoing trade war developments and geopolitical risks.A regional index fluctuated between small gains and losses, and US equity-index futures dipped 0.2% after the S&P 500 rose 0.4% on Monday—buoyed by technology shares at the beginning of what is typically a subdued month for markets. Meanwhile, bonds held steady in early Asia trading, and the dollar remained flat after touching its lowest level since 2023 in the previous session.Oil extended its gains, while gold remained steady following its largest daily jump in four weeks.Investor focus has shifted to trade headlines after the US on Monday extended Section 301 tariff exclusions on some Chinese imports until August 31. The Trump administration has asked countries to submit their “best offer” on trade talks by Wednesday, Reuters reported. Efforts are also underway to arrange a call between Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping amid renewed accusations from both sides of breaching a prior trade truce.“We continue to expect market volatility as investors digest fresh tariff headlines and incoming US economic data,” said Ulrike Hoffmann-Burchardi of UBS Global Wealth Management. “Fiscal worries remain, and geopolitical tensions are heating up.”Although Trump has pushed for direct talks with Xi, the Chinese president has so far preferred negotiations via advisors. Their last known conversation occurred in January, before Trump’s inauguration. White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett suggested on Sunday that a call could happen this week.“The markets keep shrugging off simmering trade war risks,” said Kyle Rodda, senior market analyst at Capital.com. “While it has slipped down the list of priorities for market participants, below trade policy, fiscal policy and macroeconomic data, a very solid set of quarterly results from mega cap tech is enticing investors into the market.”Japan’s domestic focus on Tuesday will be on a fresh round of government bond auctions. The finance ministry is set to sell ¥2.6 trillion ($18 billion) in 10-year notes, following weak demand at auctions last month that raised concerns over public borrowing plans.On Monday, Asian equities tumbled after US President Donald Trump escalated trade tensions by doubling tariffs on steel and aluminium to 50%, accusing China of violating a recent trade truce. “China has totally violated the agreement,” Trump said, referring to a 90-day pause agreed last month. US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick also accused China of “slow-rolling” negotiations.China dismissed the claims as “seriously contrary to the facts” and criticised Washington’s “bogus charges.” The renewed tension revived fears of a full-blown trade war, overshadowing positive inflation data from the US.Markets across Hong Kong, Tokyo, Sydney, Singapore, Taipei, Manila and Jakarta registered declines. Hong Kong’s losses surpassed 2%, led by property stocks amid concerns over New World Development’s delayed bond payments and a broader credit crunch in China’s real estate sector.Oil surged after OPEC’s modest production increase disappointed markets, while escalating Ukraine-Russia hostilities added to the anxiety. The US dollar weakened amid fears about fiscal sustainability as Trump pushed for extended tax cuts and welfare reforms.Moody’s downgraded the US’s last top-tier credit rating, citing ballooning deficits. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon cautioned that the US bond market could be heading for a crisis. “The bond market is going to have a tough time.

Gold price prediction today: Gold rates have shown considerable volatility recently, without establishing a definitive trend in either direction. International developments, particularly the trade tariff decisions by Donald Trump and ongoing geopolitical tensions, continue to influence daily gold prices. Given these unpredictable circumstances, investors face uncertainty about their investment strategies. What’s the outlook on gold prices in the near term?Following a weekly loss of 2.02% in the week ending May 30, spot gold prices are sharply higher this week due to renewed safe haven demand as US-China and other geopolitical concerns come to the fore.On Monday, China accused the US of violating the US-China trade truce as the US imposed further chip technology curbs. Last week, the US said that it will revoke visas for Chinese students who relate to the Chinese Communist Party or are studying in critical fields. The US Administration also barred the export of critical US jet engine parts and technology to China. It plans to broaden restrictions on China’s tech sector with new regulations to capture subsidiaries of companies under US curbs as well.China's slow approval for rare earth exports is being cited as the cause behind US's actions against China.US data released Monday were slightly weaker than expected. ISM manufacturing came in at 48.50 Vs the forecast of 49.50 as the manufacturing sector contracted for the third straight month on tariff uncertainties. ISM's Import component slumped to a 16-year low, while the export gauge fell to the lowest level in five years. Contraction spending in April contracted by 0.4% as against the forecast of a 0.2% expansion.The Eurozone's manufacturing PMI (May) at 49.40 matched the estimate in its final reading, while the UK's manufacturing PMI at 46.40 beat the estimate of 45.10.Total known global gold ETF holdings stood at 88.508Moz as of May 30. Holdings recorded first weekly inflow after five straight weeks of outflows as holdings are up 6.82% YTD.The European Central Bank will deliver its monetary policy on June 5 wherein the Central Bank is expected to cut the key rates by 25 bps-- its eighth rate cut since the Bank embarked on its rate cutting spree in June 2024.Major US data to be released ahead in this week include JOLTs job openings (April), ADP employment change (May), ISM Services (May), trade balance (April) and nonfarm payroll (May). Investors will also monitor China's manufacturing and services PMIs (May) and Europe's services PMIs (May).The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) carried out a massive drone attack deep inside Russia on June 1, which reportedly hit 41 Russian aircrafts. Both the countries concluded their latest peace talks in Istanbul on June 2; however, peace prospects remain dim.At the time of writing, the US Dollar Index was at 98.71, down nearly 0.60% on the day, lowest since April 2022 barring April 2024 --reciprocal tariff sell-off period. Big investments cutting their Dollar Index forecasts is also weighing on the Greenback.Ten-year US yields and 30-year US yields respectively at 4.44% and 4.9781% were up by 0.90% on the day.A close above $3,372 will be quite positive for the metal.

Trump’s 50% tariff on steel and aluminium comes into effect; Here's what we know,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/trumps-50-tariff-on-steel-and-aluminium-begins-as-global-trade-tensions-escalate/articleshow/121611034.cms,"AP photo

What Trump's 50% Tariffs Mean for the Steel Industry

What we know so far

United States has raised tariffs on imported steel and aluminium to 50% beginning Wednesday, according to a White House order signed by president Donald Trump. The decision, framed as a measure to protect domestic industries from foreign “dumping,” doubles the previous 25% levy imposed on these metals.According to the order, ""Increasing the previously imposed tariffs will provide greater support to these industries and reduce or eliminate the national security threat posed by imports of steel and aluminum articles and their derivative articles.""President Trump revealed the decision during a visit to a US steel plant in Pennsylvania last week. “At 25 percent, they can sort of get over that fence. At 50 percent, they can no longer get over the fence,” he told workers. “Nobody is going to be able to steal your industry,” he added, vowing stronger protection for American manufacturing.Steel and aluminium imports are currently taxed at 25% — a rate in place since 12 March, when president Trump’s order took effect, removing earlier exemptions on steel and raising aluminium tariffs from the levels set in his original 2018 trade measures.While some analysts say Trump’s first-term tariffs helped boost domestic steel and aluminium production, others caution that sharp new hikes could disrupt the industry’s ability to adapt.Many businesses that depend on imported steel and aluminium are already feeling the effects of Trump’s earlier tariffs. The new hikes are expected to push costs even higher. These metals are essential in products like washing machines, consumer electronics, and cars — industries that often rely on global supply chains, especially the automotive sector.Tariffs on UK imports will remain at 25%, as both countries continue trade talks under an earlier agreement, the hike targets other partners. The European Union has already warned of potential retaliation, saying the move undermines ongoing negotiations.Mexico, a major trading partner, plans to seek an exemption. Its economy minister Marcelo Ebrard argued the new tariffs are unfair, especially since the US exports more steel to Mexico than it imports. “It makes no sense,” he said.The latest tariff increase adds pressure to trade talks underway since April, when Trump reimposed 10% tariffs across multiple sectors. With the temporary pause on those hikes expiring in early July, diplomats now face a tightening window to reach workable solutions.","The US has raised tariffs on imported steel and aluminium to 50% beginning Wednesday.

Cap on management expenses leading to recalibration of business: Future Generali CEO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/cap-on-management-expenses-leading-to-recalibration-of-business-future-generali-ceo/articleshow/121612391.cms,"Bima Sugam

MUMBAI: The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) capping management expenses at 30% of premium income is prompting insurers to recalibrate their business mix according to Anup Rau, CEO of Future Generali India Insurance.In an interview with TOI, Rau was clear-eyed about the challenges and opportunities presented by regulatory change. “One of the things that has happened in wholesale health is a softening of rates,” Rau noted. “That’s partly because of the new expenses of management regulation. People want to write more low-commission business to be able to grow their retail book. So they’re being more aggressive on pricing in group health to create headroom. ”“In balance, it’s a good regulation. Eventually, it ensures that customers get better value,” said Rau. For Future Generali, the company’s focus remains squarely on retail health. “There’s still headroom for growth in retail. We’ve grown at twice the pace of the industry and will continue to invest in that,” he said.The company has also reined in its exposure to crop insurance, which previously accounted for a quarter of its business.That line is now under 10%. “We’ve reduced crop as a precaution. The model does not leave enough room to manage risks effectively,” he explained, referring to the so-called “cup-and-cap” framework, where profits are clawed back and losses subsidised which distorts pricing incentives.According to Rau, while there is a proposal to allow composite insurance companies, there are strong benefits in being a specialised insurance company. “My personal view is that if you want to grow your business and be a player of consequence and size, you are better off having two separate companies”. Rau provided the example of standalone health companies that have grown faster than industry. “Most of the market is dominated by standalone health companies,” Rau said. “They have the distribution arbitrage. They can tap any life agent without having to license them.”Rau believes Future Generali’s differentiated proposition lies in its claims execution and investment in backend systems. “We are not the cheapest. Our proposition is that we settle claims fairly and quickly,” he said. “We don’t offer the highest commissions or lowest prices. We offer the best claims experience we can.”This operational focus underpins the company’s support for, a digital platform under development by the industry. Rau is optimistic about its potential. “Bima Sugam has a lot of potential beyond selling,” he said. “It can make the ecosystem more efficient and the environment more enabling.” In his view, the platform’s greatest value lies in shared infrastructure. “Measures like common enrolments of hospitals and a common provider network can help the council negotiate rates on behalf of the industry. That will deliver better value to the customer.”He pointed to the unregulated nature of private healthcare pricing as a problem. “Hospitals don’t have a regulator. There’s still a vast difference in the claimed amount between a person who has insurance and someone who doesn’t. A unified platform can solve a lot of these issues.”According to Rau there would still be differentiated products and specialised agents. “Agents may use the platform, but they’ll also pick and choose companies they are comfortable with. They want access to management, confidence in claims processes, and a good understanding of the products.”He argues that the real transformation lies not at the customer interface, but in the infrastructure beneath it. “The front end gives the customer more options, but customers still want advice and handholding,” he said. “The real diamond is a solid backend that gets the entire ecosystem to engage better. That’s the game changer.”Rau offered a practical vision of how this might work. “An agent can sell a product on the Bima Sugam portal, register a claim, access the network and bills—all through the same system. It would significantly improve the customer experience. Historically, shared backends have been more successful than front ends—look at mutual fund platforms or Vahan.”Such platforms could include features like real-time updates, hospital networks, procedure tracking, agent locators, and surveyor rankings. “People talk a lot about the front end, but if we can get the backend right, it can really improve the experience for all stakeholders,” he said.Future Generali is investing accordingly. “We are changing our core system and building capabilities around it,” Rau said. But he pushed back against the notion that technology brings cost savings. “People think tech leads to savings—whether manpower or other costs. It doesn’t. Technology costs money. It costs even more to keep it running. Skilled people are costly and constantly in flux.”Despite this, he sees value in what digitalisation enables. “Volumes, complexity, better decision-making—that’s all real,” he said. “But even things like AI-generated suggestions can be annoying. I keep clicking ‘no’ to co-pilot prompts.”New models in the health ecosystem like managed healthcare being tried by newcomers are welcome, Rau added. “These experiments are good. The industry needs to test hypotheses and see how they play out. If successful, they could move the needle not just for the company but for the entire sector.”Future Generali is running AI and chatbot pilots across all personal lines. “This is not just for health, but across the board,” he said. The company’s operational metrics back its strategy. With a solvency margin of 196% and one of the best combined ratios in the sector, it has sustained profitability despite limited capital infusions since 2019. “The combined ratio is one of the best in the industry, despite our smaller scale. We’ve grown faster than the industry and intend to maintain that pace,” Rau said.The insurer has moved up the league tables too. “From being ranked between 13 and 17 in 2018, Future Generali is now among the top 10 general insurers,” Rau said. “We will continue to grow faster than the industry. We may not always know our exact position, but we will grow our market share.”“Our CAGR over the last five years has been 21%, compared to the industry’s 15%,” he noted. “We’ve tripled our top line in the last six years, excluding crop insurance.”Future Generali’s emphasis is not on scale alone, Rau concluded, but on execution. “In general insurance, unlike life, the difference in scale between the top player and number ten is not big,” he said. “We see a clear path to grow our presence and penetrate deeper into retail health.”","Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) capping management expenses at 30% of premium income.

Malaysia-based AirAsia Group, which once used to run a JV airline in India with the Tatas, is at the second spot at 393 planes.In Delhi for the IATA AGM, Benoit had some good news for airlines that are getting increasingly frustrated with delivery delays (including from Boeing too). ""We are seeing the first signs of stability in supply chain. We (are) now back to the pre-Covid level of producing 60 A320 family of single aisle planes every month and hope to increase this number to 75 by 2027. We have the orders and are ramping up production and every commercial (Airbus) aircraft that's flying going forward will be made partly made in India,"" Benoit said.Asked if the order book for 1,750 planes from IndiGo and AI makes a case for India to get a final assembly line (FAL), Benoit said: ""We will have final assembly lines on the other products (one for H125 helicopters for its civil range and other for C295 military aircraft).On commercial aircraft side, we are looking at expanding our footprint with industry here in India. Sourcing from India has much value than an FAL for commercial aircraft and we are constantly increasing the same from here. Airbus sourcing from India was $500 millon in 2020. We crossed the $1-billion mark in 2023 and last year we were at $1.4 billion. We will reach $ 2 billion before the end of the decade.""Remi Maillard, president of Airbus India and MD of south Asia region, said: ""India is not only a market for us. It has become a strategic resource and industrial base for Airbus.""About delays in aircraft deliveries due to supply chain issues, Benoit said: ""Now we are seeing the first signs of stability in the supply chain. But you, you never quite rest because, as we all know, the situation can change quite quickly nowadays.""","Airbus has to deliver 916 and 344 aircraft, majority of which are narrow body, to IndiGo and AI.

Final Word







The UAE Golden Visa is a long-term residency permit that allows foreign nationals to live, work, or conduct business in the country without the need for a local sponsor. Initially introduced to attract high-value investors and top global talent, the visa is valid for ten years and is renewable. It enables recipients to enjoy greater stability and freedom, including the ability to sponsor family members, retain residency during extended stays abroad, and pursue business ventures independently.The visa is open to a wide range of categories. These include investors, entrepreneurs, skilled professionals (such as doctors, engineers, and scientists), outstanding students and graduates, and high-income earners earning Dh30,000 or more per month. The list also extends to creative individuals like artists and authors, and more recently, content creators and influencers under specific criteria. While each category has its own set of eligibility requirements, one of the most popular and accessible pathways is through real estate investment.Yes, property investment is one of the simplest and most direct ways to secure a Golden Visa. If you invest Dh2 million or more in real estate, you may be eligible—provided the investment meets several conditions.The property can be owned individually or jointly, and it may even be mortgaged, as long as the mortgage is from a UAE-based bank approved by the local authority. Off-plan (under-construction) properties also qualify, but they must be purchased from government-approved developers. A key requirement is that you also hold valid UAE health insurance for yourself and your family.Once you’ve purchased qualifying property, you begin by registering the ownership and obtaining a title deed from the Dubai Land Department or the relevant land authority in your emirate. You then submit your Golden Visa application through the Land Department, the General Directorate of Residency and Foreigners Affairs (GDRFA), or via smart platforms like the Dubai REST app. Additional formalities include undergoing a medical fitness test and registering for an Emirates ID. If everything checks out, your 10-year Golden Visa will be issued and can be renewed as long as eligibility requirements are maintained.The biggest benefit is freedom. Holders of the Golden Visa do not need a local sponsor or employer to reside in the UAE, allowing them to live and work on their own terms. You can sponsor your spouse, children, and even domestic staff in certain cases. The visa gives you flexibility to travel in and out of the UAE without affecting your residency status. It’s also ideal for long-term business planning, property ownership, and lifestyle stability in a tax-friendly and globally connected hub like Dubai.There are plenty of alternative routes to the Golden Visa. If you’re a highly paid professional, a scientist, a top-ranking university graduate, or someone who has made exceptional contributions to the arts or sciences, you can also apply. Many of these routes require endorsement from relevant UAE entities, but the government has made efforts to streamline the process and attract global talent in emerging sectors.Yes, Indian nationals are fully eligible to apply for the UAE Golden Visa, and they are among its most prominent recipients. With a large Indian expatriate population already residing in the UAE, the Golden Visa offers a seamless pathway for investors, entrepreneurs, professionals, and students from India to secure long-term residency. Whether you’re purchasing property, earning a high salary, or qualifying through academic or creative excellence, Indians can access the same visa privileges as other nationalities—often with faster uptake due to their established ties and economic contribution to the Emirates.The UAE remains one of the top destinations for Indian professionals, business owners, and investors. Many Indians have already used the Golden Visa to secure a base in Dubai or Abu Dhabi, invest in real estate, and grow cross-border ventures. The visa is also an attractive option for expats from Pakistan, Bangladesh, Egypt, and the Philippines—offering a secure and flexible alternative to short-term work permits and dependent visas.The UAE is fast becoming one of the world’s most attractive destinations for high-net-worth individuals, skilled professionals, and innovators. Whether you're an investor planning to enter Dubai’s booming real estate market or a professional seeking long-term security in the Emirates, the Golden Visa is more than a travel document—it’s a ticket to opportunity. To get started, you can reach out to the Dubai Land Department, GDRFA or travel consultants to help.","The UAE Golden Visa is a long-term residency permit that allows foreign nationals to live, work, or conduct business in the country without the need for a local sponsor.

Colarado Firebomb Attack: Was pro-Palestine attacker Mohamed Sabry Soliman an 'illegal alien'?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/colarado-firebomb-attack-was-pro-palestine-attacker-mohamed-sabry-soliman-an-illegal-alien/articleshow/121562424.cms,"Mohamed Sabry Soliman is an Egyptian national whose visa, which was granted during the Biden administration, expired in March 2025 (Image Credit: X)





Following Sunday’s firebomb attack in Colorado, speculation swirled about the suspect’s nationality.

Manav Modi, Senior Analyst, Commodity Research at Motilal Oswal Financial services Ltd shares his outlook on gold prices:

Gold Trading Strategy: Buy on Dips; Support: 94500-93500; Resistance 96500-97500

Gold price prediction today: Investors face uncertainty regarding their gold investment decisions due to multiple factors affecting market sentiment. The ongoing geopolitical conflicts, coupled with evolving US-China trade negotiations, have created ambiguity in the precious metals market. What is the gold rate prediction for this week and what should investors do?Gold prices slipped from a two-week high after US President Donald Trump postponed the implementation of 50% tariffs on EU imports to July 9, easing immediate trade tensions and reducing safe-haven demand. This delay came after the EU requested more time for negotiations, leading to a temporary pullback in bullion prices.However, geopolitical risks continued to support underlying demand, with Russia launching the largest aerial assault of the war on Ukraine and Israel intensifying military strikes in Gaza.Meanwhile, gold remained under pressure from a stronger US dollar, as the dollar index hovered near the 100 mark amid rising US bond yields and mixed economic data.A US trade court initially blocked Trump's ""Liberation Day"" tariffs, only for a federal appeals court to reinstate them a day later, injecting uncertainty into markets.On the economic front, US consumer confidence came in stronger than expected at just under 100, compared to a forecast of 87.1, while core durable goods orders rose 0.2% against expectations of a 0.1% decline.However, preliminary US GDP remained in negative territory, reinforcing concerns about slowing growth. The April PCE Price Index rose 2.1% year-on-year, slightly below the 2.2% estimate, suggesting softening inflation pressures. Weekly jobless claims exceeded expectations, adding to mixed economic signals.Minutes from the Fed’s May meeting revealed growing concern about the dual risk of rising inflation and unemployment, with policymakers indicating that rate cuts remain possible later this year but are not imminent. Geo-political tensions are once again on the rise and comments from President Trump’s administration on EU and China are also keeping market participants on edge.Focus this week will be on US Jobs market data, manufacturing and Services PMI from major economies and Governor Powell’s speech.

Victoria’s Secret delays earnings release after cybersecurity breach disrupts operations,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/victorias-secret-delays-earnings-release-after-cybersecurity-breach-disrupts-operations/articleshow/121601082.cms,"Victoria’s Secret is postponing the release of its quarterly earnings after a security breach disrupted corporate operations and forced the popular lingerie brand to take its US shopping website offline for several days last week.In an update on Tuesday, the Ohio-based retailer said it first detected a “security incident involving its information technology systems” on May 24 and immediately activated its response protocols “to contain and eradicate unauthorized network access,” including engaging third-party experts, AP reported.As a precaution, the company temporarily shut down corporate systems and its US retail website on May 26. The website remained inaccessible for several days and was only restored late Thursday, causing ongoing frustration among customers.While Victoria’s Secret did not explicitly confirm a ransomware attack, analysts noted that the characteristics of the incident align with such threats, which have become increasingly common across the retail sector. The breach also impacted some in-store services at both Victoria’s Secret and Pink-branded outlets, though the company said most of those operations had since resumed.The cyberattack is also affecting the company's ability to release its first-quarter financial results. Victoria’s Secret said that it is still working to restore full access to its corporate systems, which has “prevented employees from accessing certain systems and information” required to complete its financial reporting.Despite the disruption, the company released preliminary first-quarter results for the period ending May 3, which predated the breach. It expects to report $1.35 billion in net sales and an adjusted operating income of $32 million—figures that exceed its previous guidance. Analysts polled by FactSet had forecast sales of approximately $1.33 billion.Victoria’s Secret has not announced a new date for the release of its complete first-quarter earnings report.The company maintained that the breach had no impact on its first-quarter results but added it would continue to “assess the full scope” of the incident, including any future financial implications.The Victoria’s Secret breach comes amid a broader surge in cybersecurity incidents targeting consumer-facing brands. In recent weeks, British retailers including Marks & Spencer, Harrods, and Co-op have reported cyberattacks, with M&S estimating a potential financial hit of 300 million pounds ($400 million) due to the disruption of online orders and supply chain issues.In a separate case last month, Adidas disclosed that consumer contact information had been accessed through a third-party customer service provider.Following such incidents, cybersecurity experts urge consumers to stay vigilant. They warn that fraudsters may exploit the situation by sending phishing emails, offering fake promotions, or attempting to misuse compromised data.","Victoria's Secret says it detected a ""security incident involving its information technology systems"" on May 24.

Wall Street gains as global markets steady amid US China trade talk hopes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-stock-market-today-june-3-dow-jones-nasdaq-sp-500-wall-street-us-china-trade-war/articleshow/121600202.cms,"US stocks advanced on Tuesday while global markets remained largely steady, as investors waited for further clarity on US trade policy and the broader economic impact of President Donald Trump’s tariffs.The S&P 500 rose 0.6% in afternoon trading, building on recent momentum following a strong May. The index now sits within 3% of its all-time high, recovering significantly from a near 20% drop two months earlier. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 170 points, or 0.4%, while the Nasdaq Composite climbed 1%.Discount retailer Dollar General led notable gainers, surging 14.3% after reporting better-than-expected earnings and raising its full-year guidance. However, the company warned that “uncertainty exists for the remainder of the year” due to the potential effects of tariffs on its customer base.Trade-related uncertainty continues to weigh on corporate forecasts. Many companies have either withdrawn or lowered their financial projections, citing unpredictability in tariff implementation. On Tuesday, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) downgraded its US economic growth forecast for 2025 to 1.6%, from 2.8% last year.Despite pessimism about tariffs, current data shows limited immediate damage. Manufacturers are starting to feel pressure, but overall economic fundamentals—especially the labor market—remain solid. Inflation is subdued, and layoffs are still relatively low.New labour data showed job openings in the US exceeded expectations at the end of April, suggesting continued strength in hiring. This precedes Friday’s closely watched employment report, which will provide a fuller picture of job market trends in May.Investor sentiment was also buoyed by anticipation of potential progress in US-China trade relations. The US indicated that President Trump may speak with Chinese President Xi Jinping later this week. However, a spokesperson from China’s foreign ministry stated they had no information about such a call.Constellation Energy gained 0.7% after it finalized a 20-year agreement to supply Meta Platforms with electricity from its Clinton, Illinois, nuclear facility.In the bond market, yields were stable. The 10-year Treasury yield inched up to 4.47% from 4.46% the previous day. Earlier in the session, yields had dipped before recovering following the strong labor report.Yields have risen over the past two months amid concerns that the US government’s plans for large tax cuts could significantly increase federal debt. Higher yields tend to raise borrowing costs for consumers and businesses, and they can also weigh on equity valuations.Globally, most stock indices showed muted movements. European and Asian markets were mixed. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index stood out, rising 1.5% even as data revealed a slowdown in China’s manufacturing sector in May.Meanwhile, South Korean markets remained closed for a snap presidential election. The vote follows the dramatic removal of conservative leader Yoon Suk Yeol, who now faces a trial on rebellion charges tied to his attempt to impose martial law in December.","The S&P 500 rose 0.6% in afternoon trading, building on recent momentum following a strong May.

It expects US growth to decline further to 1.5% by 2026, and noted that average US tariff rates have surged from 2.5% to 15.4%, the highest level since 1938.“We have seen a significant increase in trade barriers as well as in economic and trade policy uncertainty. This sharp rise in uncertainty has negatively impacted business and consumer confidence and is set to hold back trade and investment,” said OECD chief economist Álvaro Pereira in an accompanying commentary.The Trump administration has imposed sweeping tariffs, including 10% taxes on imports from nearly all countries, and higher duties on steel, aluminium, and automobiles. Trump has also threatened to double some of these tariffs, further rattling markets.The legal future of these tariffs remains uncertain after a federal court in New York struck down many of them last week, only for an appeals court to temporarily reinstate them.The global economic outlook is also under strain, with the OECD predicting world growth to drop to 2.9% in 2025 and remain there through 2026, down from 3.3% in 2024 and 3.4% in 2023. While the global economy has shown resilience through crises like the COVID-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine, mounting trade frictions are now a key headwind.China’s economy, already hit by a real estate crisis, is forecast to slow from 5% in 2024 to 4.7% in 2025 and 4.3% in 2026, with Chinese exporters particularly vulnerable to US tariff increases. Beijing is expected to counter some of the pressure through monetary easing and public investment in sectors like manufacturing and elder care.Meanwhile, the eurozone is set to see a modest rebound, with growth projected to rise from 0.8% in 2024 to 1% in 2025, and 1.2% in 2026, aided by anticipated rate cuts from the European Central Bank.The OECD, a group of 38 advanced economies, provides policy recommendations and economic forecasts aimed at promoting global stability and prosperity.(With inputs from agencies)",The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) released its latest global outlook on Tuesday.

'He died rich' won’t be on my tombstone: Bill Gates to spend bulk of his $200 billion fortune on health and education in Africa over next 20 years,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/he-died-rich-wont-be-on-my-tombstone-bill-gates-to-spend-bulk-of-his-200-billion-fortune-on-health-and-education-in-africa-over-next-20-years/articleshow/121593623.cms,"Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates has pledged to spend the majority of his estimated $200 billion fortune over the next two decades to improve health and education services across Africa. Speaking at the African Union (AU) headquarters in Addis Ababa, the 69-year-old billionaire said, “By unleashing human potential through health and education, every country in Africa should be on a path to prosperity.”The announcement follows Gates’ earlier commitment to give away 99% of his wealth by 2045, at which point his philanthropic organisation, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, plans to wind down operations. “I recently made a commitment that my wealth will be given away over the next 20 years. The majority of that funding will be spent on helping you address challenges here in Africa,” Gates told African leaders and innovators gathered at the AU headquarters.Gates highlighted his foundation’s focus on strengthening primary healthcare. “What we've learned is that helping the mother be healthy and have great nutrition before she gets pregnant, while she is pregnant, delivers the strongest results.Ensuring the child receives good nutrition in their first four years as well makes all the difference,” Gates said, as quoted by BBC.He also called on Africa’s young innovators to consider how Artificial Intelligence (AI) can play a role in transforming healthcare delivery across the continent. “Africa largely skipped traditional banking and now you have a chance, as you build your next generation healthcare systems, to think about how AI is built into that,” he said. As an example, he pointed to Rwanda’s use of AI-enabled ultrasound to detect high-risk pregnancies.Mozambique's former First Lady, Graça Machel, welcomed Gates’ pledge, saying it came at a “moment of crisis.” She added, “We are counting on Mr Gates' steadfast commitment to continue walking this path of transformation alongside us.”The pledge comes amid reductions in US foreign aid to Africa under former President Donald Trump’s “America First” policy, which included cuts to HIV/AIDS programs. Gates acknowledged the growing need for external support and reiterated his foundation’s long-term commitment to the continent.According to the Gates Foundation, its three priorities are: ending preventable deaths of mothers and babies, ensuring the next generation grows up free from deadly infectious diseases, and lifting millions out of poverty.Gates also addressed public scrutiny of his philanthropic efforts. Though he remains one of the world’s wealthiest individuals, he wrote in a blog post last month, “People will say a lot of things about me when I die, but I am determined that ‘he died rich’ will not be one of them.”Alongside Paul Allen, Gates founded Microsoft in 1975. He stepped down as CEO in 2000 and left the company’s board in 2020. He credits his decision to give away his wealth in part to inspiration from fellow philanthropist Warren Buffett. Still, the Gates Foundation has faced criticism over its influence in global health and claims that it uses its charitable status to avoid taxes, allegations that Gates has not directly addressed.Despite this, Gates emphasized the urgency of his mission. “This is not charity. It’s an investment in Africa’s future.”",Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates has pledged to spend the majority of his estimated $200 billion fortune over the next two decades to improve health and education services across Africa.

OECD cuts global growth forecast to 2.9% in 2025 and 2026 amid escalating trade war,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/oecd-cuts-global-growth-forecast-to-2-9-in-2025-and-2026-amid-escalating-trade-war/articleshow/121593416.cms,"The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) lowered its global economic growth forecast on Tuesday, citing the impact of a widening trade war driven by US President Donald Trump's tariff policies. The Paris-based organization warned that these measures, particularly new tariffs, are set to significantly slow the world economy, with the United States expected to be among the hardest hit.After a global growth rate of 3.3 percent in 2024, the OECD now predicts the world economy will grow by just 2.9 percent in both 2025 and 2026. This is down from its earlier forecasts in March, which projected 3.1 percent growth in 2025 and 3.0 percent in 2026, AFP reported.Since that previous forecast, President Trump has launched a series of tariffs that have unsettled global financial markets.""The global outlook is becoming increasingly challenging,"" the OECD stated, highlighting that ""substantial increases"" in trade barriers, tighter financial conditions, reduced business and consumer confidence, and greater policy uncertainty could have ""marked adverse effects on growth"" if they continue.The OECD revised its 2025 growth projection for the US from 2.2 percent down to 1.6 percent, with further deceleration expected in 2026 to 1.5 percent. This comes despite Trump’s optimistic messaging, including a post on his Truth Social platform ahead of the OECD’s report, stating: “Because of Tariffs, our Economy is BOOMING!”The OECD’s ministerial meeting is being held in Paris on Tuesday and Wednesday, where US and EU trade officials are also expected to meet. This follows Trump’s threat of 50-percent tariffs on EU goods. Separately, the Group of Seven (G7) is also convening to discuss trade issues.“For everyone, including the United States, the best option is that countries sit down and get an agreement,” said OECD chief economist Alvaro Pereira in an interview with AFP. “Avoiding further trade fragmentation is absolutely key in the next few months and years,” he added.Trump introduced a baseline 10-percent tariff on global imports in April and has announced increased tariffs on a number of countries, though implementation has been delayed until July to allow time for negotiations. Additionally, the president has imposed a 25-percent tariff on cars and plans to raise tariffs on steel and aluminium to 50 percent starting Wednesday.In its report, the OECD emphasized that ""weakened economic prospects will be felt around the world, with almost no exception,"" noting that ""lower growth and less trade will hit incomes and slow job growth."" The US economy, which expanded by 2.8 percent in 2024, now faces a bleaker outlook.The effective tariff rate on US merchandise imports has soared from two percent in 2024 to 15.4 percent—its highest level since 1938—according to the OECD. This spike, coupled with policy uncertainty, ""will dent household consumption and business investment growth,"" the report said.The organization also pointed to ""high economic policy uncertainty, a significant slowdown in net immigration and a sizeable reduction in the federal workforce"" as contributing factors to the US slowdown.While inflation across the Group of 20 (G20) economies is projected to moderate to 3.6 percent in 2025 and 3.2 percent in 2026, the US remains an outlier. Inflation in the United States is forecast to climb to just under four percent by the end of the year—twice the Federal Reserve's target rate.China’s growth forecast has also been trimmed slightly, from 4.8 percent to 4.7 percent in 2025. China has been affected by triple-digit US tariffs, which have been temporarily eased. Japan's growth outlook was revised down from 1.1 percent to 0.7 percent. However, the eurozone’s forecast remains steady at one-percent growth.“There is the risk that protectionism and trade policy uncertainty will increase even further and that additional trade barriers might be introduced,” Pereira wrote in the report.“According to our simulations, additional tariffs would further reduce global growth prospects and fuel inflation, dampening global growth even more,” he warned.","The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) lowered its global economic growth forecast on Tuesday.

US in a rush on trade deals

US warns trading partners to ignore court verdict

The Donald Trump administration has issued a new ultimatum to countries to share their best offers on trade deals by Wednesday, five weeks ahead of the day when the reciprocal tariffs are set to kick in. A draft letter, originating from the United States Trade Representative's office, reveals Trump's strategy to conclude extensive trade negotiations with many countries.Whilst the recipients weren't specified, the correspondence targeted nations actively participating in discussions involving meetings and document exchanges. The United States has been conducting such discussions with several partners, including the European Union, Japan, Vietnam and India.These talks commenced on April 9 when he suspended his ""Liberation Day"" tariffs for a 90-day period until July 8, following adverse reactions in the stock, bond and currency markets to the comprehensive nature of these duties.According to a Reuters report, the Trump administration appears to be in a rush to finalise agreements before its self-imposed deadline expires. Despite consistent assurances from senior officials, including White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett, about multiple deals being close to completion, the United States has only managed to secure one agreement with a significant trading ally: Britain.However, this agreement primarily serves as a structure for future negotiations rather than a conclusive arrangement.Also Read | ‘Wait and watch…’: India, US working to give preferential market access to businesses, says Piyush Goyal on trade deal The United States, as per the draft letter seen by Reuters, requires nations to present their best proposals across several crucial sectors. These include offers related to tariffs and quotas for acquiring US industrial and agricultural goods, along with strategies to address existing non-tariff obstacles. The correspondence seeks details about pledges concerning digital commerce, economic security, and nation-specific obligations.Within days, the United States plans to assess the replies and propose 'a possible landing zone' that might incorporate a mutual tariff arrangement.A representative from USTR confirmed ongoing trade discussions, stating: ""Productive negotiations with many key trading partners continue at a rapid pace. It is in all parties' interest to take stock of progress and assess any next steps.""Tiffany Smith, National Foreign Trade Council's vice president of global trade policy, expressed approval of the USTR initiatives.""We are encouraged that USTR is moving negotiations ahead as quickly as they can,"" she told Reuters, noting that trade agreements eliminating obstacles for American businesses overseas whilst reducing US tariffs would be ""a win-win if they are done in a way that returns predictability and stability to trade relationships.""Also Read | Will the Donald Trump administration be forced to give billions of dollars in tariff refunds? The tariff strategy, a cornerstone of Trump's ""America First"" economic programme, aims to transform US trade partnerships, decrease trade deficits and safeguard American industries. Republican politicians anticipate that tariffs will boost federal income and counterbalance the expenses of tax reduction legislation currently under congressional review.The impact of Trump's tariff decisions has significantly affected market performance. During May, US stocks achieved their most substantial gains since November 2023, following a period of sharp declines in global markets due to Trump's successive tariff declarations throughout February, March and early April.Questions have emerged regarding the legal validity of the methodology employed in implementing his most extensive tariff measures.On Wednesday last week, the International Trade Court determined that Trump had exceeded his legal authority regarding tariffs implemented under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, encompassing the ""Liberation Day"" duties and previous tariffs on Canadian, Mexican and Chinese goods, linked to Trump's claims about these nations enabling fentanyl trafficking into the United States. The following day, an appeals tribunal temporarily suspended this ruling. The disputed tariffs are anticipated to remain active whilst legal proceedings continue.The proposed correspondence to trade allies cautions against assuming the tariffs would cease if courts rule unfavourably regarding Trump's IEEPA application.The draft states: ""Regardless of ongoing litigation concerning the President's reciprocal tariff action in U.S. courts, the President intends to continue this tariff program pursuant to other robust legal authorities if necessary, so it is important that we continue our discussions on these matters.""Also Read | ‘Work of fiction…’: Will Donald Trump bury US government in debt with multitrillion-dollar tax breaks?

US President Donald Trump and China's counterpart Xi Jinping are likely to speak this week, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Monday, following the tension that flared between the two economic powerhouses over breaching tariff and trade restriction agreements.Responding to the reporter's query, Leavitt said, ""I can confirm that the two leaders will likely talk this week."" ""And as always, when foreign leaders call, we will provide a readout of those calls,"" she added, as per ABC News report.Treasury secretary Scott Bessent indicated on CBS' ""Face the Nation"" that a discussion between Trump and Xi would occur ""very soon"" to address trade matters, including disputes over critical minerals and Chinese export limitations.Trump expressed confidence about speaking with Xi on Friday, while Chinese officials noted in April that no recent communications had occurred between the leaders.The US trade representative's office extended tariff exclusions for certain solar manufacturing equipment and other Chinese products until August 31, providing additional time for ongoing Beijing negotiations.Bessent, who led Geneva negotiations resulting in a temporary trade war cessation between the world's largest economies, acknowledged to Fox News that progress has been limited since then, Reuters reported.The US-China agreement to reduce triple-digit tariffs for 90 days sparked significant gains in global markets, though it failed to address core U.S. concerns about China's state-controlled, export-focused economic structure.A US trade court determined on Wednesday that Trump exceeded his authority in implementing most tariffs on Chinese and other imports under emergency powers. However, a federal appeals court swiftly restored the tariffs the following day, temporarily suspending the trade court's decision pending government appeal. The court set response deadlines of June 5 for plaintiffs and June 9 for the administration.","US President Donald Trump and China's counterpart Xi Jinping are likely to speak this week.

Targeting Pakistan’s Funding Sources

IMF’s Strong Warning to Pakistan

Pakistan may not want to go to the world with a ‘begging bowl’, but the fact remains that its economy is in dire straits. During a recent address, Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif acknowledged the country’s extremely poor economic condition and emphasised that the world does not want it to come to it with a ‘begging bowl’. He said Pakistan needs to focus on international investments rather than financial assistance.However, seeking bailout packages is not new for Pakistan. It has a long history of asking for loans and funds from external institutions and countries, and doing little to improve its economic indicators. Recently, Pakistan's National Accounts Committee said that the country’s GDP growth fell short of official projections for FY 2024-25, achieving only 2.68 per cent growth compared to the targeted 3.6 per cent.Pakistan's economic recovery remains delicate as it works under a $7 billion International Monetary Fund programme. The conditions of this financial package necessitate structural changes, including increased electricity rates and additional taxation measures.Also Read | Explained in charts: India to become 4th largest world economy soon. What's the road ahead to No.3 spot? Pakistan aims to obtain external commercial funding amounting to $4.9 billion during fiscal year 2025-26. The government’s aim is to secure $2.64 billion in short-term commercial bank borrowings.Pakistan's economy faces multiple challenges and risks, and India’s punitive measures post the Pahalgam terror attack are not making it easier for Islamabad to emerge stronger.The agriculture sector, which provides employment to about 40% of the labour force, is facing substantial disturbances following India's move to suspend the Indus Waters Treaty.The kharif (summer crops) planting period in Pakistan faces significant challenges due to severely reduced water levels at its crucial dams - Mangla on river Jhelum and Tarbela on the Indus river. Additionally, there has been an abrupt reduction in Chenab river flow following India's water regulation after the Pahalgam terror incident. The water crisis could worsen during the early kharif sowing period this month.According to recent data from Pakistan's Indus River System Authority (IRSA), the country currently has a 21% deficit in water flow, whilst the two primary dams show approximately 50% reduction in live storage. These dams are vital for irrigation in Pakistan's Punjab and Sindh provinces, as well as for hydroelectric power generation.The IRSA's recent evaluation of water availability for summer sowing during May-Sept highlighted concerns about reduced water flow in river Chenab at Marala, attributing it to India's limited supply, which would affect early kharif season operations, according to a TOI report.Also Read | India’s big crackdown! 20 export houses under scanner for illicit Pakistan trade using UAE route; trade-based money laundering suspected The authority announced a 21% overall deficit and instructed reservoir management and irrigation monitoring bodies to carefully manage water resources from storage facilities, considering the ""crisis created by Indian short supplies in Chenab river"".Whilst monsoon in the catchment region could potentially improve conditions by next month, Pakistan's agricultural activities will be significantly influenced by India's management of water flow through its limited storage facilities - Baglihar and Salal - situated on the Chenab in J&K.Officials believe India's suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty could significantly impact Pakistan's ability to handle flood situations during peak flow periods when monsoon affects the Indus river system's catchment areas, with a substantial portion situated within India.Agricultural activities in Pakistan's Punjab and Sindh provinces are entirely reliant on irrigation channels connected to the Indus river network, which receives nearly all its water from the western rivers - Indus, Jhelum and Chenab.India aims to restrict Pakistan's access to funds in its ongoing efforts against state-sponsored terrorism from across the border. Following its opposition to Pakistan's IMF bailout package, India intends to challenge forthcoming World Bank loans earmarked for Pakistan as well.Furthermore, India intends to approach the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), the global financial crime watchdog, seeking Pakistan's return to its ‘grey list’.Pakistan's exit from the FATF grey list in 2022 had improved its credibility with financial institutions, which was vital for its economically challenged situation.

The IMF has outlined 11 new conditions for Pakistan to secure continued financial support, including passing a Rs 17.6 trillion federal budget aligned with IMF targets by June 2025 and implementing agricultural income tax reforms across all provinces.Other key requirements include publishing a governance reform plan, preparing a long-term financial sector strategy, rebasing electricity tariffs by July, and adjusting gas tariffs by February 2026. The IMF also demands permanent legislation for a captive power levy, removal of the cap on a debt servicing surcharge, phasing out tax incentives in special technology zones by 2035, liberalizing used car imports, and allocating Rs 1.07 trillion for development spending.","Pakistan's economic recovery remains delicate as it works under a $7 billion International Monetary Fund programme.

Federal Reserve may consider rate cuts in 2025 amid uncertainty over Trump's tariffs: Governor Waller,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/federal-reserve-may-consider-rate-cuts-in-2025-amid-uncertainty-over-trump-tariffs-governor-waller/articleshow/121575268.cms,"Federal Reserve building

US Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller hinted on Monday that interest rate cuts could still be on the table in the coming months, even amid potential inflationary pressures from newly introduced tariffs.Speaking at an event in Seoul, South Korea, Waller said, ""I support looking through any tariff effects on near term-inflation when setting the policy rate,"" adding that the inflation impact stemming from President Donald Trump 's recent import taxes is likely to be temporary, reported Reuters.Waller indicated that if tariff levels remain in the low range, and “underlying inflation continues to make progress to our 2% goal” while the labor market remains “solid,” he would support “good news” rate cuts later this year. “Fortunately, the strong labor market and progress on inflation through April gives me additional time to see how trade negotiations play out and the economy evolves,” he said.His remarks come amid growing uncertainty surrounding presidential trade policies, as Trump imposes tariffs with variable rates and implementation timelines. Legal challenges to these tariffs also raise questions about their long-term viability.The federal funds target rate currently stands between 4.25 per cent and 4.5 per cent.Waller acknowledged the complex risk environment, noting, “I see downside risks to economic activity and employment and upside risks to inflation in the second half of 2025, but how these risks evolve is strongly tied to how trade policy evolves.”He also cautioned that higher tariffs could have a negative impact on consumer spending and business operations. “Higher tariffs will reduce spending, and businesses will respond, in part, by reducing production and payrolls,” he said. Waller anticipates a one-time inflation spike, particularly in late 2025, with consumers likely absorbing only part of the effect from modest tariffs.Also read: GTRI recommends this ‘pragmatic route’ for India to deal with Donald Trump’s tariffs on steel & aluminium Addressing concerns about a repeat of past policy misjudgments, Waller said, “What often has people spooked is we had the same view in 2021, that all this stuff was transitory, it was a one-time level effect, and then it would all go away.” However, he stressed that the current economic environment differs significantly from that of the pandemic era.Turning to financial markets, Waller raised concerns about foreign sentiment toward US government debt. “There's been a risk-off attitude from foreign buyers of Treasuries, all US assets ... It's not really that big, but it's definitely there,” he said, adding, “There seems to be an attitude that foreign buyers of assets are not welcome in some sense.”","US Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller hinted on Monday that interest rate cuts could still be on the table in the coming months.

Additionally, Ukrainian strikes within Russian territory over the weekend heightened concerns regarding global oil and gas distribution.Global trade tensions also contributed to the decline as Beijing dismissed US claims regarding breach of tariff reduction agreements. Simultaneously, tensions with the European Union escalated following Trump's proposal to increase steel duties twofold.This was in line with the expectation of Wall Street opening on Monday.

China on Monday criticised the US for a series of moves, including new restrictions on AI chip exports, blocking chip design software sales, and reportedly planning to revoke student visas for Chinese nationals.Last week, US secretary of state Marco Rubio pledged to ""aggressively"" revoke visas for Chinese students, a broad measure that has alarmed families, university administrators, and Chinese officials. Currently, more than 275,000 Chinese students are enrolled at US universities.China's foreign ministry swiftly denounced the decision.

China also claimed to have suspended other trade measures as part of its commitments.China’s commerce ministry accused the US of backtracking and acting unilaterally. “Instead of reflecting on itself, it has turned the tables and unreasonably accused China of violating the consensus, which is seriously contrary to the facts,” it said.Tensions flared again on Friday when US President Donald Trump accused China of violating the agreement.In a post on Truth Social, Trump said, “The bad news is that China, perhaps not surprisingly to some, HAS TOTALLY VIOLATED ITS AGREEMENT WITH US. So much for being Mr. NICE GUY!”However, later that day in the Oval office Trump said he would speak with Chinese President Xi Jinping and “hopefully we’ll work that out.”Last week, the Trump administration announced that it will start revoking visas of Chinese students studying in the US, further intensifying the clash.Both nations are competing to lead in cutting-edge technologies like artificial intelligence, with Washington aiming to restrict China’s access to the most sophisticated computer chips.Meanwhile, China is striving to surpass the US as the dominant power in the Asia-Pacific region, including efforts to assert control over Taiwan, a close US ally and major tech powerhouse","China criticises US for new restrictions on AI chip exports, blocking chip design software sales, and reportedly planning to revoke student visas.

AI to hit entry-level white-collar roles hardest: Jefferies report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/ai-to-hit-entry-level-white-collar-roles-hardest-jefferies-report/articleshow/121568719.cms,"Representative AI image

Entry-level white-collar positions are likely to be the most affected by Artificial Intelligence (AI) implementation, according to a recent report by Jefferies. The findings highlight growing employment concerns for new workforce entrants in the United States, particularly recent university graduates.Currently, the unemployment rate for recent US university graduates stands at 5.8 per cent- well above the national average of 4 per cent and more than double the 2.7 per cent rate recorded among all university graduates.""We believe AI's most significant impact for investors will be through labour disruption, beginning with entry-level roles,"" said Jefferies, as quoted by ANI.The report claimed that that individuals entering the workforce are encountering greater employment challenges compared to other demographic groups.Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei, cited in the report, projected that AI could replace as much as half of entry-level white-collar jobs within one to five years. Amodei also warned that this trend could lead to a sharp rise in unemployment, potentially reaching between 10 per cent and 20 per cent.Sales, customer support, software development and marketing were identified as particularly vulnerable sectors, with junior-level staff forming a significant share of the workforce in these areas.The report also noted that a degree in technology no longer assures job security. Unemployment rates among recent graduates in Computer Engineering and Computer Science have reached 7.5 per cent and 6.1 per cent respectively.AI’s growing presence is evident across industries. Jefferies' research shows that out of 419 US companies that discussed AI in their earnings calls since 2021, 40 per cent came from non-tech sectors such as retail, finance and healthcare.Industry leaders present differing views on the impact of AI adoption. IBM CEO Arvind Krishna reported a net increase in employment following AI integration. In contrast, Klarna’s CEO admitted that AI-led staff reductions compromised customer service quality, potentially requiring the company to rehire in the future.The Jefferies analysis positions AI as both a transformative opportunity and a serious challenge. While AI may drive efficiency and growth, it also raises significant concerns for early-career professionals.The report also stressed on the need for a coordinated response from corporations, governments and educational institutions to promote skill development and support workplace transitions in the AI era.","Recent US university graduates have the highest unemployment rate at 5.8 per cent.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021.

Income Tax Changes FY 2025-26: April 1, 2025, signals the start of the fresh fiscal year. As the new financial year begins, several new income tax regulations come into effect, including a more rationalised new income tax regime, higher basic exemption limit and tax rates. Additionally, several changes in TDS, TCS rules also take effect.Understanding these new income tax rules is crucial, as they influence tax deductions from various income sources, including salary and interest earnings. Additionally, these changes will determine your tax liability for income earned in FY 2025-26.The revised new tax regime introduces new income tax slabs and rates. Under the new income tax regime income above Rs 24 lakh will now attract a 30% tax rate as against Rs 15 lakh earlier. Also, the basic exemption limit has been raised from Rs 3 lakh to Rs 4 lakh.With changes in the new income tax regime, individuals earning a taxable income up to Rs 12 lakh will now have to pay ZERO tax! This provision applies exclusively to individuals who select the new tax regime in FY 2025-26. However, this does not exempt one from filing an income tax return (ITR). The zero tax benefit is available through a tax rebate under Section 87A of the Income Tax Act, 1961.To access the tax rebate under Section 87A, individuals must submit their ITR. For salaried individuals earning up to Rs 12.75 lakh, there will be no tax with a Rs 75,000 standard deduction.Also Read | How to calculate income tax with latest tax slabs: Have taxable income above Rs 12 lakh? Know how it will be taxed under new income tax regime The Budget 2025 has introduced modifications to the taxation structure of specific ULIPs. The revised regulations specify that ULIP proceeds not qualifying for exemption under Section 10 (10D) shall be classified as capital assets and will be incorporated within the equity-oriented funds category, according to an ET report.Consequently, proceeds from ULIPs that do not qualify for Section 10 (10D) exemption will face capital gains taxation. A 20% tax rate applies to short-term gains, whilst long-term gains attract a 12.5% tax without the benefit of indexation.Tax exemption under Section 10 (10D) continues to apply to ULIP proceeds where the annual premium remains below Rs 2.5 lakh.Tax experts note that previously, there existed no definitive taxation guidelines for ULIPs with premiums exceeding Rs 2.5 lakh. This ambiguity arose because ULIPs, unlike conventional policies, direct a substantial portion of premiums towards stock market investments, making traditional policy taxation frameworks unsuitable. These taxation revisions take effect from FY 2025-26.The Budget 2025 has introduced modifications to TDS provisions, encompassing adjustments to rates and elevating thresholds for implementing these provisions.Key TDS amendments include:a) Section 194LBC TDS rate adjustment: This applies to income distributed by securitisation trust to resident investors. Currently, until March 31, 2025, individuals or Hindu Undivided families face 25% TDS, whilst others face 30%. Starting April 1, 2025, a uniform 10% TDS rate shall apply.b) Threshold adjustments: Effective April 1, 2025, elevated thresholds will apply to sections 193, 194A, 194, 194K, 194B, 194BB, 194D, 194G, 194H, 194-I, 194J and 194LA, enabling taxpayers to retain more disposable income.The government has eliminated provisions requiring increased TDS and TCS rates for ITR non-filers. This revision takes effect from April 1, 2025, removing higher TDS and TCS obligations for those who haven't submitted ITRs in specified periods.The Budget 2025 memorandum states: ""Section 206AB of the Act, requires deduction of tax at higher rate when the deductee specified therein is a non-filer of income-tax return. Section 206CCA of the Act, requires for collection of tax at higher rate when the collectee specified therein is a non-filer of income-tax return. This is subject to other conditions specified in the two sections. Representations were received from various stakeholders that it is difficult for the deductor/collector, at the time of deduction/collection, to verify whether returns have been filed by the deductee/collectee, resulting in application of higher rates of deduction/collection, blocking of capital and increased compliance burden. Accordingly, to address this issue and reduce compliance burden for the deductor/collector, it is proposed to omit section 206AB of the Act and section 206CCA of the Act.""Also Read | Latest income tax slabs FY 2025-26: What are the new income tax slabs, rates after Budget 2025 announcements? Check new vs old tax regime comparison - FAQs answered The recent Budget 2025 has incorporated NPS Vatsalya contributions within Section 80CCD framework. Individuals can now avail deductions for their NPS Vatsalya contributions under this section. This benefit remains exclusive to taxpayers who continue with the old tax regime.Starting April 1, 2025, the Budget has revised the tax-free perquisite thresholds for employed individuals. The updated regulations permit tax exemption on employer-funded international medical treatment expenses, covering both employees and their family members.Starting April 1, 2025, the authorities have granted immunity from legal proceedings for delayed Tax Collected at Source (TCS) payments under specific circumstances. The revised regulations specify that no legal action shall commence against individuals who remit TCS to the Central Government before the prescribed deadline for submitting quarterly statements.Also Read | Budget 2025 Income Tax calculator explained: Save up to Rs 1.1 lakh! How income tax slab changes will benefit taxpayers at different salary levels under new regime The timeframe for submitting updated returns has been lengthened. Under the revised regulations effective April 1, 2025, individuals now have 48 months from the assessment year's conclusion to submit their updated returns. Previously, taxpayers were allowed 24 months post-assessment year to file these returns. The new provision doubles the available time period.The tax authorities have streamlined the process of calculating annual house value for taxation purposes. This revision enables straightforward income tax filing by allowing nil value declaration for any two properties.The authorities have modified the annual value definition for self-occupied properties, providing clarity to homeowners whilst maintaining the existing two-property restriction.Beginning April 1, 2025, tax officials will conduct comparative analyses between current and previous Income Tax Returns (ITRs) to identify inconsistencies. This provision takes effect from April 1, 2025. Whilst the implementation date is confirmed, the tax authority has not yet detailed which specific discrepancies they will examine across both ITRs.Also Read | How much tax do individuals earning slightly above Rs 12 lakh have to pay?

EPFO to increase auto settlement limit to 5 lakhs for PF claims and allow UPI withdrawals,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/epfo-to-increase-auto-settlement-limit-to-5-lakhs-for-pf-claims-and-allow-upi-withdrawals/articleshow/119812227.cms,"Representative image

Auto settlement claims

UPI withdrawals for PF members

The Employees Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has announced to increase in the auto-settlement of advance claims (ASAC) limit, raising it five times from Rs 1 lakh to Rs 5 lakh. The move is designed to enhance the 'ease of living' for its 7.5 crore members, sources told news agency ANI.According to sources, Sumita Dawra, Secretary of the Ministry of Labour and Employment, approved the proposal during the 113th meeting of the Executive Committee (EC) of the Central Board of Trustees (CBT) in Srinagar, Jammu and Kashmir, on March 28.“This revision will enhance the ease of living for crores of our members,” Dawra said in a statement. Following this approval, the recommendation will be forwarded for final approval by the CBT. Once approved, EPFO members will be able to withdraw up to Rs 5 lakh through the auto-settlement process.EPFO’s auto-settlement process has seen tremendous growth, processing a record 2.16 crore auto-claims as of March 6, 2025, compared to just 89.52 lakh claims in the previous year. This reflects the increasing efficiency of the system, with 95% of claims now being settled automatically within three days.“The auto-settlement process has greatly simplified claim settlements, significantly reducing the time and human intervention required,” said Ramesh Krishnamurthi, Central Provident Fund Commissioner. “We are committed to making the process more efficient, and with the increasing number of automated claims, our goal is to make accessing PF funds easier for all members.”Additionally, EPFO has expanded the categories for which advance claims can be settled automatically, now covering illness, education, marriage, housing, and more. The system’s improvements have also led to a reduction in the rejection rate of claims, from 50% last year to just 30% this year.In another game-changing development, EPFO will soon allow Provident Fund (PF) withdrawals through Unified Payments Interface (UPI) and ATMs. The Ministry of Labour and Employment has given approval for the plan, and members will be able to access their funds through UPI and ATMs by the end of May or June 2025.“This new system will make it even more convenient for members to access their PF savings instantly through UPI and ATMs,” Dawra said. “It is a groundbreaking move that will set a precedent for other government savings schemes, like the General Provident Fund (GPF) for government employees and the Public Provident Fund (PPF) for bank customers.”The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) has recently streamlined its auto-settlement process, leading to a significant reduction in claim processing time—from several weeks to just three days. As a result, EPFO's claim settlements are expected to surpass 6 crore for the first time. The number of members utilizing the auto-settlement feature has more than doubled, rising from just under 90 lakh last fiscal year to nearly 2 crore this year.Currently, only 8% of transfer claims require attestation from both the member and employer, while 48% are submitted directly by members, and 44% are processed automatically. EPFO has already reduced its procedural steps from 27 to 18, with plans to further streamline the process to just six steps.","The Employees Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) has announced to increase in the auto-settlement of advance claims (ASAC) limit, raising it five times from Rs 1 lakh to Rs 5 lakh.

MUMBAI: Investors on Dalal Street largely discounted the US's new tariff plans on Thursday with the sensex, after opening about 800 points lower, closed 322 points or 0.4% down. On the NSE, Nifty too took a similar trajectory and closed 82 points or 0.4% lower at 23,250 points.

""The primary catalyst for today's decline was the deteriorating global sentiment, exacerbated by the US's President Donald Trump's announcement of a 26% reciprocal tariff on Indian imports. Additionally, a 25% tariff on auto component imports further dampened market sentiment, prompting a cautious stance among investors,"" Kewat said.Although the domestic markets closed marginally lower on Thursday, as the US markets were sliding in mid-session, market players expect some hard times for Dalal Street investors on Friday.In the commodity market globally, prices of gold and silver both were deep in the red.

Always consult with a qualified investment advisor or financial planner before making any investment decisions.

Macquarie Equity Research has put an ‘underperform’ rating on Vodafone India with a target price of Rs 6.50. Analysts feel the government’s decision to convert the company’s obligations due in FY26 to equity reiterate the government’s supportive intent for a three-player market, but they expected timeline extensions instead of equity dilution. With underlying free cash flow generation for VodaIdea still inadequate, they maintained their guarded stance.Elara Securities India has put an ‘accumulate’ rating on Hindalco Industries with a target price of Rs 734. Analysts feel that in the long run the company may witness margin expansion in its domestic business, driven by operational benefits from coal mines and a higher share of value-added products. For Novelis, margin growth would be supported by operating leverage, contract repricing, and cost-saving initiatives. As most margin drivers are likely to materialize beyond FY27, we retain our earnings estimates and our target price.Emkay Global Financial Services has downgraded Dabur to ‘reduce’ rating with a reduction in target price to Rs 450 from Rs500 earlier, mainly due to weak business execution. Analysts said Dabur in its recent business update noted a mid-single-digit decline in the domestic business, which is a key business concern in our view.

Trump defends tariffs, says “markets will boom”



Wall Street suffered its worst day since the 2020 Covid crash as US stocks plummeted on Thursday, shedding more than $2 trillion in market value following President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs on foreign imports. The S&P 500 tumbled 4.8%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost over 1,600 points (4%), and the Nasdaq plunged 6%, rattling investor confidence and fueling recession concerns.Economists warned of prolonged economic uncertainty as businesses brace for higher costs and potential retaliatory measures. Retailers, tech firms, banks, and airlines bore the brunt of the selloff, with major companies seeing double-digit declines. “This is a game changer, not only for the US economy but for the global economy,” said Olu Sonola of Fitch Ratings, predicting a high risk of recession.Despite the turmoil, Trump defended his tariffs, claiming they would ultimately strengthen the economy. “The markets are going to boom, the stock is going to boom, the country is going to boom,” he insisted. As investors reeled, Trump attended a LIV Golf event and traveled to Mar-a-Lago, while White House officials scrambled to justify the policy.The selloff impacted nearly every sector. Retailers, tech firms, airlines, and banks were among the worst performers as concerns grew that consumers would cut spending and reduce demand.“Obviously, the tariffs are higher and worse than people expected,” said Tom Cahill of Ventura Wealth Management. “It’s going to take some time to sort out exactly what the effects are going to be, not only on the economy, but also on company earnings.”Consumer spending, which makes up 70% of US economic activity, is expected to slow if companies pass on tariff costs. “If consumers pull back their spending because of higher prices, businesses will produce fewer goods and economic growth could stall or contract,” AP reported.Airlines projected strong profits earlier in the year, but rising costs could deter consumer travel:Most US apparel brands rely on overseas manufacturing:Heavy importers suffered major hits:Global supply chains expose tech firms to tariffs:Concerns about lower borrowing and spending:Reduced discretionary spending hits food chains:Relatively insulated from the tariffs—though still impacted:Meanwhile, as global markets reeled from his sweeping tariffs, US President Donald Trump on Thursday defended the move, claiming it would ultimately strengthen the economy.“I think it’s going very well. It was an operation like what a patient gets operated on, and it’s a big thing,” Trump told reporters. “We have six or seven trillion dollars coming into our country… The markets are going to boom, the stock is going to boom, the country is going to boom.”Despite US stocks suffering their worst day since 2020, Trump remained defiant. On Truth Social, he posted: “ The operation is over! The patient lived and is healing… The patient will be far stronger, bigger, better, and more resilient than ever before. Make America greatagain!""On Wednesday, Donald Trump announced sweeping “Liberation Day” tariffs, including a 10% base duty on most countries, 20% on the EU, 25% on South Korea, and 24% on Japan.Analysts warned of a looming recession and inflation risks. “Here you have a tremendous amount of uncertainty... that’s why the market is heading for a bear market,” said Adam Sarhan of 50 Park Investments.As markets tumbled, Trump attended a LIV Golf tournament before heading to Mar-a-Lago, while White House officials defended the tariffs on news networks.","Wall Street suffered its worst day since the 2020 Covid crash as US stocks plummeted on Thursday, shedding more than $2 trillion in market value.

Technology stocks plunged on Thursday after President Donald Trump’s new tariff policies triggered widespread market panic.Apple led the sharp decline among the ""Magnificent Seven"" tech stocks, dropping nearly 9%. The iPhone maker, which manufactures many of its devices in China and other Asian countries, is on track for its biggest drop since 2020, according to CNBC.The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell more than 5%, heading towards its worst performance in over five years. The index has dropped 14% year-to-date.Other major tech companies also felt the impact. Meta Platforms and Amazon both dropped more than 7%, while Nvidia and Tesla slumped over 5%. Nvidia, which builds its chips in Taiwan and assembles artificial intelligence systems in Mexico, was especially hard-hit. Microsoft and Alphabet each fell around 2%.Semiconductor stocks suffered as well, with Marvell Technology, Arm Holdings, and Micron Technology falling over 8%. Broadcom and Lam Research dropped 6%, while Advanced Micro Devices fell more than 4%. Personal computer makers Dell and HP saw significant losses, with both stocks falling over 16%.The sell-off in tech stocks was part of a broader market downturn triggered by fears of a global trade war after Trump unveiled a blanket 10% tariff on all imported goods, along with higher duties targeting specific countries. The new tariffs were described by Trump as a “declaration of economic independence” for the U.S.The tariff measures include a 34% tax on China, in addition to a previous 20% levy, a 46% duty on imports from Vietnam, and a 20% tariff on goods from the European Union. In response, China’s Ministry of Commerce called for the immediate cancellation of the tariffs and warned of “resolute counter-measures.”The tariffs came at a difficult time for the tech-heavy Nasdaq, which had already experienced a tough quarter, with concerns about a weakening U.S. economy weighing on stocks. Trump, however, applauded some of the biggest tech companies for investing in the U.S., highlighting Apple’s plan to spend $500 billion over the next four years.","The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell more than 5%, heading towards its worst performance in over five years.

Approximately $1.7 trillion vanished from the US' S&P 500 Index when trading began on Thursday, as concerns grew that President Donald Trump's extensive tariffs could trigger an economic recession Companies with overseas manufacturing dependencies suffered the most significant losses. Apple Inc. , which produces most of its US-marketed devices in China, declined 8 per cent after opening. Lululemon Athletica Inc. and Nike Inc., with manufacturing connections to Vietnam, dropped about 10 per cent. Walmart Inc. and Dollar Tree Inc., which stock internationally sourced products, fell by 2 per cent and 11 per cent, respectively.The US market experienced widespread effects, with the benchmark index facing its largest decline since 2022. By 9.35 am in New York, approximately 70 per cent of S&P 500 companies showed losses, with nearly half declining by 2 per cent or more.Later during mid-day trading, S&P 500 experienced a significant decline of 4 per cent, surpassing losses in other primary stock markets. During its lowest point in the morning, it was heading towards its most substantial single-day decline since the Covid-19 impact in 2020. At 11.50 am Eastern time, the Dow Jones Industrial Average registered a decrease of 1,412 points, marking loss of 3.3 per cent, whilst the Nasdaq composite showed a steeper decline of 5.1 per cent.Futures market also recorded significant losses as S&P 500 Futrues plunged 5 per cent. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures dropped 2.8 cent, signalling steep losses when US markets open. Nasdaq futures fell 3.8per cent. Oil prices also took a hit, dropping more than 4per cent, and the US dollar sank to its lowest level against the Japanese yen since early October. The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged by 1,150 points, while the Nasdaq composite fell 4.3 per cent, according to news agency AP.""There's really not anybody getting spared in absolute terms,"" said Garrett Melson, a portfolio strategist at Natixis Investment Managers Solutions. ""You're just wrapped up, today at least, in a broad de-risking, and so it's kind of just across the board taking chips off the table,"" he added, as reported by Bloomberg.The scope and intensity of these tariffs exceeded Trump's first-term measures, threatening to disrupt global supply chains , worsen economic deceleration, and increase inflation.Citigroup analysts, led by Atif Malik, indicated that if Apple absorbed the tariff-related cost increases from China, the iPhone manufacturer's gross margin could decrease by up to 9per cent.Meanwhile, JPMorgan economist Michael Feroli noted that the plan represents the largest tax increase since 1968. It could potentially raise prices by 1.5 per cent this year, according to the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure, whilst negatively affecting personal incomes and consumer spending.""This impact alone could take the economy perilously close to slipping into recession,"" Feroli wrote. ""And this is before accounting for the additional hits to gross exports and to investment spending.""US assets emerged as primary casualties following the announcement. The S&P 500 decreased by 3 per cent, whilst the dollar indicator declined. International markets showed less severe reactions: Asian stocks fell 0.7 per cent, the Stoxx Europe 600 declined 2.6%, and the euro strengthened by 2 per cent against the dollar.The semiconductor sector also experienced significant losses. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index dropped nearly 6%, with Nvidia Corp., Broadcom Inc., and Micron Technology Inc. declining over 5 per cent. Caterpillar Inc. and Boeing Co., which derive substantial revenue from China, fell by at least 5 per cent.Apple led the decline among the Magnificent Seven stocks. This group, including Tesla, Microsoft, Nvidia, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms, had driven much of the US stock market's growth over the previous two years.UBS Group AG's Bhanu Baweja wrote to clients: ""We see 5,300 as the near-term target for the S&P 500, but if tariff uncertainty persists or negotiations with trading partners don't go well, risks of downside through 5,000 become real. The probability of US stocks entering bear market is going higher.""This comes after Trump, following the Wednesday trading session, announced a universal 10 per cent baseline import tariff applicable to all nations, with additional levies on countries holding trade surpluses with the US. Specifically, Chinese imports will incur a 34 per cent duty, whilst the European Union faces a 20 per cent charge, and Taiwan encounters a 32 per cent rate. This policy decision has significantly disrupted international markets, with China experiencing substantial impact as the new increase elevates its aggregate tariff exposure to 64%, inclusive of existing trade measures.","$1.7 trillion vanished from the US' S&P 500 Index when trading began on Thursday, as concerns grew that President Donald Trump's extensive tariffs could trigger an economic recession.

NEW DELHI: Former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan on Thursday described the Trump administration’s new reciprocal tariffs on about 60 countries as a ""self-goal,"" and said that the move will primarily hurt the US economy in the short run.Rajan, however, mentioned that the impact on India would be relatively ""smaller"".US President Donald Trump has announced additional ad-valorem duties ranging from 10% to 50% on imports from all trading partners.The baseline 10% duty will take effect on April 5, followed by a 27% duty on April 9. Some sectors, including pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, and energy products, are exempt.""Let us recognise that in the short run, this will adversely affect the US economy first and foremost — it is a self-goal as footballers would say,"" Rajan told PTI. ""Coming to the effects on other countries, the direct effect of any tariff on India's exports will be to raise prices for US consumers, reducing their demand, and hence Indian growth.""Rajan, currently a professor at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, explained that because the tariffs apply to multiple countries, the impact on India will not be as severe. ""Of course, to the extent that the US has applied tariffs on other countries also, and India is competing with producers from those countries, the overall effect will be smaller than if the tariffs had been applied only on India — since US consumers will not be able to substitute away to non-tariffed producers.""He also commented on Trump’s broader economic strategy: ""The long-term intent of Trump is to increase US production, but, even if feasible, that will take a long time to set up.""On how India should respond, Rajan suggested reducing domestic tariffs to boost trade and competitiveness. ""We can certainly bring down the tariffs we have been raising — that would be beneficial to India regardless of whether it will help us negotiate down US tariffs.""He also pointed out the need for a smarter trade strategy: ""More generally, India needs to understand the world has become much more protectionist, so we have to be more clever about trade."" He urged India to strengthen ties with Asean, Japan, Africa, and Europe while also focusing on regional cooperation. ""That means overcoming political differences. As the world breaks up into regional blocks, South Asia should not be the odd region out.""Trump, announcing the tariffs from the White House Rose Garden, framed them as a major step to revive American industry. ""This is Liberation Day, a long-awaited moment. April 2, 2025, will forever be remembered as the day American industry was reborn, the day America's destiny was reclaimed, and the day that we began to make America wealthy again. We are going to make it wealthy, good, and wealthy.""Holding up a chart listing tariff disparities, Trump pointed out: ""The US charges other countries only a 2.4 per cent tariff on motorcycles, but Thailand and others are charging much higher rates, like 60 per cent, India 70 per cent, Vietnam 75 per cent, and others charge even higher rates.""","Former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan described the Trump administration’s new reciprocal tariffs as a ""self-goal"" He said that the move will primarily hurt the US economy in the short run. Rajan, however, mentioned that the impact on India would be relatively ""smaller""","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119949267,imgsize-1581082,width-400,resizemode-4/Untitled-design-43.jpg"
How Trump's tariffs will hit Chinese companies like Temu and Shein,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/how-trumps-tariffs-will-hit-chinese-companies-like-temu-and-shein/articleshow/119948237.cms,"US President Donald Trump’s latest executive order, signed on Wednesday, targets the “de minimis” trade exception that had previously allowed Chinese companies like Temu and Shein to ship low-cost goods to the United States without facing tariffs.This loophole, which applies to goods valued under $800, has been instrumental in allowing these companies to thrive in the US market by offering ultra-cheap products to American consumers. The new executive order closes this loophole by imposing a 30% ad valorem tariff on shipments of goods worth less than $800 from China and Hong Kong, according to New York Times.The tariffs will increase to $50 per item starting in June. For companies like Temu and Shein, which have built their businesses around offering inexpensive goods, these tariffs could significantly raise costs, potentially undermining their business model in the US market.The de minimis rule, originally designed to facilitate the import of small goods by tourists, had been exploited by Chinese fast-fashion retailers. According to a report from the Congressional Research Service, the value of such imports surged from $5.3 billion in 2018 to $66 billion in 2023. As a result of the new tariffs, these companies will face higher costs for every item they ship to the US, likely forcing them to raise prices and complicating their logistics.Trump’s executive order also requires that international carriers transporting items from China and Hong Kong to the US must secure an international carrier bond to ensure payment of the newly imposed duties. This additional regulation could further strain these companies’ operations.While the move is hailed by some as a way to curb illicit shipments, particularly of synthetic opioids, critics argue that it will harm lower-income American consumers, who benefit the most from the low-cost imports, particularly in poorer US zip codes. The Cato Institute estimates that scrapping the de minimis exception will cost US consumers between $11 billion to $13 billion annually.","US President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Wednesday.

The US trade deficit narrowed in February, according to data released by the Commerce Department on Thursday, which was collected before President Donald Trump launched his latest round of global tariffs.The trade gap shrank by 6.1% to $122.7 billion, slightly exceeding analysts' expectations, according to news agency AFP.In February, Trump introduced, then paused, sharp tariffs on Canada and Mexico, while also imposing additional duties on China. Since then, he has rolled out hefty levies on sectors such as steel, aluminium, and autos, with a global 10% tariff set to hit US trading partners in early April. Some countries and trading blocs will face even higher rates in the future.These tariffs are expected to have a significant impact on US trade, as businesses adjust supply chains and try to mitigate rising costs. ""Front-loading of imports remained in full effect in February,"" noted Matthew Martin, senior US economist at Oxford Economics, referring to businesses rushing to stock up ahead of anticipated tariff hikes.The tariffs announced on Wednesday ""will add uncertainty to the outlook,"" Martin added, warning that businesses may struggle to adjust as the April 5 deadline looms for new tariffs. This could lead to a sharp decline in imports during the second quarter, while retaliatory tariffs from other countries will likely weigh on US exports.In February, the trade deficit contracted as exports rose and imports remained nearly unchanged. Exports increased by $8.0 billion to $278.5 billion, driven by industrial supplies, nonmonetary gold, and autos. Meanwhile, imports edged down slightly to $401.1 billion, as declines in industrial supplies were not fully offset by increases in consumer goods.","The US trade deficit shrank by 6.1% to $122.7 billion in February.

Wall Street and global markets took a sharp downturn Thursday following US President Donald Trump's announcement of new tariffs on imports from around the world, stoking fears of an escalating trade war and rising recession risks, news agency AP reported.The S&P 500 was down 4% in morning trading, worse than the drops for other major stock markets. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 1,520 points, or 3.6%, as of 10:10 a.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite was 4.0% lower., according to news agency AP.Trump's broadly crafted new levies battered leading names in banking, technology, apparel and most other areas. Among the S&P 500's 11 sectors, only consumer staples were in positive territory, with the other 10 in the red.This marked the fourth consecutive day of early declines for US markets, with little hope for a recovery by day’s end.Also read | Wall Street tumbles: Nearly $2 trillion wiped as Trump's tariffs shake US markets Trump unveiled a 10% baseline tariff on imports from all countries, along with higher tariffs on nations with trade surpluses with the US Notably, China will face a 34% tax on imports, while the European Union will be charged 20%, and Taiwan will face 32%. The move has sent shockwaves through global markets, with China particularly affected by the tariff hike, which now brings its total tariff burden to 64% when factoring in previous measures.Asian markets, though somewhat shielded by the anticipation of further stimulus from Beijing, still felt the brunt of the news. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index dropped 1.7%, while the Shanghai Composite slid by 0.2%.Trump has argued that the tariffs aim to level the playing field and bring manufacturing jobs back to the US However, economists warn that these measures could dampen growth for the US and the global economy, while increasing inflation, which is already hovering stubbornly above the Federal Reserve’s 2% target.The tariff announcements follow earlier actions, including a 25% tariff on auto imports, levies on steel and aluminium, and expanded tariffs on countries such as China, Canada, and Mexico. Trump's trade policies also target oil imports from Venezuela, and he has proposed additional tariffs on pharmaceuticals, lumber, copper, and computer chips.Treasury yields swung dramatically, reflecting the uncertainty in the markets. The 10-year Treasury yield dropped as low as 4.04% before settling at 4.11%, down from 4.23% late Wednesday and nearly 4.80% earlier this year.The commodity market also saw significant losses, with US benchmark crude oil shedding $3.36, or 4.7%, to $68.35 per barrel, and Brent crude falling $3.29, or 4.4%, to $71.66 per barrel. Declining oil prices typically signal economic pessimism, as oil is seen as a key indicator of global economic health.In Europe, markets also slumped, though not as severely as in the US Germany's DAX dropped 2.4%, the CAC 40 in Paris lost 2.7%, and the FTSE 100 in Britain shed 1.5%.Asian markets saw a variety of losses. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 index briefly dipped 4% before closing 2.8% down. South Korea, impacted by a 25% tariff, saw its Kospi index fall 1.1%.

Fab 5: The five countries missing from Trump's list of reciprocal tariffs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/fab-5-the-five-countries-missing-from-trumps-list-of-reciprocal-tariffs/articleshow/119943712.cms,"President Donald Trump speaks during an event to announce new tariffs in the Rose Garden at the White House, in Washington. AP/PTI

US President Donald Trump’s latest wave of reciprocal tariffs has dealt a significant blow to numerous countries, with rates ranging from 10% to as high as 50%. However, five countries—Russia, Canada, Mexico, North Korea, and Cuba—were notably absent from the list.Their exemption has raised questions, especially given that major trading partners such as India (27%), the European Union (20%), and Vietnam (46%) were subjected to steep duties.Russia, North Korea, Cuba, and Belarus were not included in this latest round. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent explained that Russia had been left out because existing sanctions had already reduced trade between the two countries to minimal levels.Although Canada and Mexico were not named in Trump’s 2 April tariff announcement, they have not been entirely spared from trade penalties. Earlier in the year, the US imposed a 25% tariff on imports from both countries, along with a 10% rate specifically targeting Canadian energy and potash.Goods covered by the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) continue to be exempt from the new duties. However, new tariffs on auto parts and other products are set to come into force on Thursday.Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, speaking to Bloomberg, said that his government would respond with countermeasures to protect Canadian workers.Mexico is preparing its own response, with President Claudia Sheinbaum expected to address the matter at a press conference on Thursday.A US official noted that the excluded countries already faced high tariffs and that prior sanctions had rendered meaningful trade with them virtually impossible.Saurav Ghosh, co-founder of the bond investment platform Jiraaf, suggested another possible reason for Russia’s exclusion: the ongoing negotiations between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. He noted that due to existing sanctions, US-Russia trade had already decreased significantly, and added that if Trump was still in talks with Putin over ending the war in Ukraine, a cooperative Russia would likely be necessary.It also remains unclear whether Trump plans to revise his approach to countries that continue purchasing Russian oil and gas.The new tariff strategy appears focused on countries with substantial trade surpluses with the US. China, for example, which had a $295 billion surplus with the US in 2024, has been hit with a 34% tariff.Ghosh remarked that countries in Asia, along with the EU, tend to have higher trade deficits with the US, which may explain their position at the top of the tariff list. He added that Trump has cited non-tariff barriers, such as domestic VAT systems and currency manipulation, as contributing factors in determining tariff levels—suggesting that restoring trade balance has been the administration’s primary concern.Among the more unexpected moves in this latest round were the heavy tariffs on Japan (24%) and Vietnam (46%). Ghosh described these as particularly striking developments.As global trade adjusts to these new measures, several countries are preparing retaliatory actions. Canada and Mexico are weighing their next steps, while both Asian and European nations brace for the broader impact.For now, Russia and North Korea remain outside Trump’s line of fire—though that could easily change, depending on how diplomatic relations evolve in the coming months.","Russia, North Korea, Cuba, and Belarus were not included in this latest round.

Trump Makes World Suffer But Keeps Putin Away From US Tariffs Hitlist: Here's Why Russia Was Skipped

US and Russia improving ties



Trump seeks more trade with Russia: Report



US President Donald Trump has announced sweeping tariffs, imposing a minimum 10% levy on nearly all nations worldwide, with additional higher rates targeting approximately 60 countries. Notably, Russia was missing from the list of countries.During his announcement, Trump held up a board listing around 50 countries, detailing the tariffs each imposed on the United States and the reciprocal duties the US would slap. Notably, while many nations were included, Russia's name was absent from the list.When questioned, press secretary Karoline Leavitt explained to Axios that Russia's omission was due to existing US sanctions that ""preclude any meaningful trade.""Yet, America's trade volume with Russia surpasses that of several included nations, such as Mauritius and Brunei.The tariff list was remarkably comprehensive, including tiny territories like Tokelau (pop. 1,500) in the South Pacific and Svalbard (pop. 2,500) in the Arctic Circle, which belong to New Zealand and Norway respectively. Leavitt clarified that Cuba, Belarus and North Korea were also excluded due to pre-existing high tariffs and sanctions.US-Russia trade statistics show a dramatic decline from approximately $35 billion in 2021 to $3.5 billion last year, following sanctions imposed after Russia's Ukraine invasion.Recently US was seen siding with Russia in the international organisation. To everyone's surprise, US supported Russia in UNGA. US voted against the European-drafted resolution condemning Moscow's actions and supporting Ukraine's territorial integrity.And then again in the UN Security Council (UNSC) Russia and US approved a US-backed resolution calling for a swift end to the conflict that avoided labelling Russia as the aggressor or acknowledging Ukraine’s territorial integrity.According to a report by Forbes, Trump is seeking an enhanced trade relations with Russia while implementing tariffs to limit trade with other nations.Economic experts highlight that Canada, Mexico and Europe present significantly more commercial prospects than Russia. They challenge the rationale behind Trump's tariff strategy aimed at reducing trade deficits.Notably, the United States has historically maintained a substantial trade deficit with Russia, Trump's preferred trading partner.Following a telephone discussion between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin on March 18, 2025, the White House announced, ""The two leaders agreed that a future with an improved bilateral relationship between the United States and Russia has huge upside. This includes enormous economic deals and geopolitical stability when peace has been achieved.""Trump frequently discusses potential trade arrangements with Russia and contemplates easing sanctions, despite Russia's continuing Ukrainian invasion and UN-documented human rights violations, including civilian targeting and the kidnapping of approximately 20,000 Ukrainian children.Analysis of US-Russia trade statistics reveals two significant points. Firstly, bilateral trade volumes are relatively modest, totalling roughly $3.5 billion in 2024 and $36 billion in 2021. By comparison, US-Canada trade reached $762 billion in 2024.The United States maintains a considerable trade deficit with Russia, contradicting Trump's stance on trade imbalances with other nations. Before sanctions following Russia's Ukraine invasion, 2021 figures show US exports to Russia at $6.4 billion against imports of $29.6 billion, creating a $23 billion deficit. Similar patterns appear in other years, with US exports primarily comprising chemicals, machinery and transport equipment, whilst importing oils, chemicals and metals.Specialists indicate Russia presents an unfavourable and potentially dangerous environment for international businesses.During U.S.-mediated ceasefire discussions, which have now largely halted, Russia requested Trump to reduce some sanctions. Trump recently threatened Russia with secondary oil tariffs and expressed anger towards Vladimir Putin regarding his Ukraine statements.Leavitt indicated possible ""additional strong sanctions"" against Russia.Notably, Canada and Mexico were also absent from Trump's extensive tariff list. Leavitt confirmed this was because of existing 25% tariffs on both nations.","US President Donald Trump has announced sweeping tariffs, imposing a minimum 10% levy on nearly all nations worldwide.

Cambodia: 49%

Japan: 24%

EU: 20%

South Korea: 25%

Countries like the UK, Singapore, and Brazil only face the 10% universal tariff.

Boosting American industry

Pressuring other nations to lower their own tariffs

Generating revenue to replace income taxes

Q: What happens to Canada and Mexico under this plan?

A:

25% tariffs on non-USMCA-compliant goods

Auto tariffs, particularly on vehicles not manufactured with a certain percentage of US-made parts

Q: What are Trump’s broader goals with these tariffs?

A:

Revive domestic manufacturing: “If you make products in America, you pay no tariffs,” Trump has repeatedly said.

Reduce the trade deficit: The US had a $918 billion goods and services deficit in 2024.

Force reciprocal trade: White House officials claim the goal is “rectifying the unfair trade practices of our foreign trading partners.”

Replace income taxes: Trump has suggested tariff revenues could fund tax cuts and reduce the national debt.

Q: How long will these tariffs last?

A:

Q: Are there any products or sectors exempt from these tariffs?

Semiconductors, pharmaceuticals, copper, and lumber

Energy products and minerals not produced in the U.S.

Steel, aluminum, and autos already covered under previous tariffs won’t face new reciprocal levies.

Q: What does this mean for India specifically?

Lowering duties on bourbon whiskey and Harley-Davidson bikes

Committing to buy more US oil, LNG, and defense equipment

Promising more tariff cuts

Despite these moves, Trump went ahead with the tariffs, likely as leverage for a broader bilateral trade deal, which both sides hope to conclude this year.

FULL SPEECH: 'Looted, Plundered': Trump QUAKES Europe; Unleashes Reciprocal Tariffs On One & All

US President Donald Trump on Wednesday announced sweeping tariffs on global imports, a move that marks one of the boldest protectionist pushes in recent history.Trump introduced a universal baseline tariff of 10% on all imports starting April 5, with steeper levies for countries the US considers trade violators. These tariffs come on top of existing duties and are backed by emergency powers invoked under a national security pretext.The policy marks a return to aggressive tariff diplomacy, with the White House targeting countries it labels “worst offenders” based on trade deficits and non-tariff barriers. China, India, Japan, and the EU are among those slapped with sharply higher rates.Here is all you need to know about Trump tariffs:Trump introduced two layers of tariffs:Trump declared this a new phase in US trade, saying, “For years, hard-working American citizens were forced to sit on the sidelines as other nations got rich and powerful, much of it at our expense. But now it’s our turn to prosper.”These tariffs are being imposed using emergency powers under a declared national emergency citing the US’s large and persistent trade deficits.The reciprocal tariffs are aimed at what Trump’s team calls the “worst offenders”—countries with large trade surpluses with the US or those that impose higher tariffs and non-tariff barriers on American goods. Examples include:The administration argues that persistent trade deficits are a national threat. Trump invoked emergency powers, citing a “national security and economic security” threat from trade imbalances. A senior White House official said, “The president would impose ‘baseline tariffs’ on all countries,” with higher reciprocal rates targeted at nations with discriminatory trade practices.The strategic goals include:The administration says these measures could raise “hundreds of billions of dollars in any given year.” As per a WSJ report, Capital Economics estimates that Trump tariffs could bring in up to $835 billion. However, ""assuming such high tariffs lead to a marked decline in imports, the increase in revenues will probably end up closer to $700 billion,"" they wrote in a note to clients. That would be about 2.3% of the country's GDP, they added.Canada and Mexico escape the new reciprocal tariff regime, but they’re not entirely in the clear. Both countries still face:The White House clarified that Canada and Mexico will continue under prior executive orders, mainly focused on immigration and fentanyl. Trump previously announced exemptions but warned these are subject to change.Trump has multiple ambitions:In essence, Trump sees tariffs not just as trade tools but as economic weapons to reshape the global economic order.There is no expiration date. The executive order allows the president to adjust the tariffs based on foreign compliance. It states duties may be reduced if countries “take significant steps to remedy non-reciprocal trade arrangements.”But the White House emphasized the current focus is enforcement, not negotiation. A senior official said, “Certainly, countries are very interested in trying to see what they can do to have more reciprocal trade. For the moment, we are very, very focused on getting the tariff regime in place.”Retaliation from other nations could lead to further escalation.A: Yes, several sectors are temporarily shielded:However, the White House has launched new investigations that could bring some of these products under future tariffs, especially pharmaceuticals and computer chips.India is one of the biggest targets of this round, hit with a 26% tariff—more than Japan (24%) and the EU (20%). Trump said, “India, very, very tough. Very, very tough,” adding that despite Modi being a “friend,” India charges the US “52%.”India had tried to avoid the tariffs through concessions:The commerce ministry is reviewing the impact of the 26 percent reciprocal tariffs imposed by the US on India, PTI reported, quoting a senior government official.""The ministry is analyzing the impact of the announced tariffs,"" the official said. They added that if a country addresses the concerns raised by the US, the Trump administration may consider reducing the duties for that nation.""It is a mixed bag and not a setback for India,"" the official said.The announcement sparked a sharp decline in stock markets, especially among multinational firms exposed to global trade.“US stock-index futures declined between 2% and 4.3% in after-hours trading,” and stocks like Apple, Amazon, and Nike fell more than 4%.Auto companies and manufacturers with international supply chains were hit especially hard. Analysts warn the move could stoke inflation by raising the cost of imported goods.Mary Lovely, a fellow at the Peterson Institute, said the tariffs were “much worse than we feared” and warned of “huge implications for rerouting of trade globally.”Countries hit by these tariffs are weighing countermeasures. Brazil is pushing legislation to retaliate without WTO arbitration. Canada has already imposed C$60 billion in counter-tariffs and threatened more. India may fast-track trade negotiations to win exemptions or relief.But Trump warned, “Any retaliation by countries to the measures announced on Wednesday would be met with more levies from the US.”In short, the world may be headed toward a new phase of trade conflict, potentially undermining the global order that has governed trade since World War II.(With inputs from agencies)","US President Donald Trump on Wednesday announced sweeping tariffs on global imports.

Wall Street

Asian markets and US stock futures tumbled on Thursday after Donald Trump unveiled a sweeping increase in tariffs on imports from across the globe, escalating trade tensions and sending investors into a frenzy.Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 index dropped more than 3.4 per cent before a slight recovery, closing 2.9 per cent lower at 34,699.52. South Korea’s Kospi also slumped, losing 1.9 per cent to 2,459.30 after the US imposed a 25 per cent tariff on South Korean imports.Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 slid 1.8 per cent to 7,793.10, while US futures hinted at steep losses ahead. The S&P 500 futures contract fell 3 per cent, and Dow Jones Industrial Average futures dropped 2 per cent, setting the stage for a volatile session when Wall Street reopens.US President Trump’s tariff announcement, which he called “liberation day” measures, included a 24 per cent “reciprocal tariff” on Japan, one of America’s closest allies, along with new levies on China, the European Union, Canada, and Mexico. Speaking at the White House, Trump showed off a chart outlining new import taxes, including a 34 tariff on Chinese goods, 20 per cent on the EU, and 32 per cent on Taiwan.He justified the move as an effort to “bring fairness” to global trade and revive US manufacturing jobs. However, analysts warn the tariffs could stifle economic growth and push inflation higher at a time when the Federal Reserve is struggling to keep it under control.Before the tariff announcement, US markets saw another turbulent session with the S&P 500 climbing 0.7 per cent to 5,670.97 after oscillating between a 1.1 per cent loss and a 1.1 per cent gain.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.6 per cent to 42,225.32, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq advanced 0.9 per cent to 17,601.05.Tesla dropped over 6 per cent on weak first-quarter deliveries but later recovered.

Will Trump’s tariffs trigger another market sell-off? FIIs cash out stir worries investors,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/will-trumps-tariffs-trigger-another-market-sell-off-fiis-cash-out-stir-worries-investors/articleshow/119912682.cms,"AI generated image

What’s behind the

FII sell-off

?

Opportunity amid the fear

Should you be buying now?

What began as a strong rally in March is now showing signs of uncertainty. Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs), who played a major role in driving a 6% rally in the Nifty throughout March, have sold off Rs 10,255 crore worth of Indian stocks in recent trading sessions.The sell-off comes just before US President Donald Trump ’s highly anticipated Liberation Day tariff announcements.VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Investments, notes that while today’s tariff declaration may reduce some uncertainty around reciprocal tariffs, the unpredictability of Trump’s past decisions suggests that the uncertainty could persist well beyond today.FIIs had turned aggressive buyers toward the end of March, likely driven by end-of-year considerations. Their buying spree triggered short-covering, which contributed to India’s outperformance. However, with the market's direction shifting, FIIs are now resuming short positions.According to an ET report, Vijayakumar advises investors to wait for more clarity on tariffs and market trends. If the tariffs are worse than expected, there could be further sell-offs, though domestic consumption-driven sectors are expected to remain resilient in such a scenario.Jahangir Aziz from JPMorgan warns that India may not be spared from reciprocal tariffs. Even if India avoids these, sector-specific tariffs could still be a risk. He highlights two additional concerns: the potential for a global risk-off event and its impact on the dollar. If US equities suffer, history suggests that global markets, including India, will not remain unaffected.Market expert Sunil Subramaniam views the current volatility as short-term pain with potential for medium-term gain. He believes that much of the price correction is already priced in, in anticipation of bad news. Unless there is a surprise sector-specific tariff, Subramaniam suggests that the worst may already be priced in. He recommends a staggered investment approach over the next six months, advising investors not to try to pick sectors or stocks at this moment—comparing it to “catching a falling knife.”Sudip Bandyopadhyay, Group Chairman of Inditrade Capital, acknowledges the uncertainty surrounding the markets. “The April 2 tariff announcement is creating significant psychological pressure. There’s a lot of speculation and mixed signals coming from the US It’s difficult to predict what will happen, which is why many investors are staying light ahead of the event.”Bandyopadhyay also sees opportunity in the midst of this uncertainty. “There are several strong stocks experiencing corrections due to this unpredictability, making it a great time for building a long-term portfolio. Don’t invest all your funds today, but begin to allocate slowly. Large-cap and mid-cap stocks are trading at more attractive valuations compared to where they might be in September 2024.”The verdict is still out on whether the current correction is a golden opportunity or the start of further pain. According to the ET report, analysts agree that while near-term uncertainty will persist, investors with a long-term outlook can start deploying capital gradually.Vijayakumar remains cautiously optimistic, noting that India’s economic fundamentals are still strong. While near-term volatility may be influenced by global factors, domestic demand continues to remain robust.Bandyopadhyay echoes this sentiment, suggesting that it’s impossible to predict how the global markets or India’s markets will react once the tariffs are announced. “We’ll likely get a clearer picture when the market opens after the announcement. So while uncertainty is high, it’s still a good time to start putting money to work.”Meanwhile, Aziz points out that India’s real challenge lies not just in tariffs, but in how global monetary policy unfolds. “If there’s a global slowdown or a risk-off event, emerging markets like India will need the ability to respond with rate cuts,” he says.With FIIs turning net sellers once again, the direction of the market now hinges on Trump’s upcoming tariff decision. Will it be a minor setback or a major blow? Either way, investors should brace for volatility and carefully evaluate their investment strategy .","FIIs had turned aggressive buyers toward the end of March, likely driven by end- of-year considerations.

What are reciprocal tariffs, and who pays them?

Economic and political fallout

US President Donald Trump is set to announce sweeping new ""Liberation Day"" tariffs on Thursday, a move he claims will boost domestic manufacturing and punish unfair trade practices. However, economists warn that the measures could damage the US economy, strain global alliances, and lead to higher consumer costs .""April 2, 2025, will go down as one of the most important days in modern American history,"" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Tuesday, adding that the tariffs would take effect immediately. The new levies target a wide range of imports, including automobiles, steel, aluminium, pharmaceuticals, and computer chips. Trump has also imposed tariffs on nations importing oil from Venezuela and hinted at broader future measures.Despite concerns over economic downturns and declining consumer sentiment, the administration remains confident. Trade adviser Peter Navarro suggested the tariffs could generate $600 billion annually—the largest tax increase since World War II. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the tariffs might be negotiable, but the White House has yet to confirm details.Reciprocal tariffs are import taxes imposed on foreign goods to match the tariffs those countries place on American exports. Trump has long insisted that foreign nations bear the cost of these levies, but in reality, importers—mostly US companies—pay them. These costs are typically passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices.Tariffs are intended to protect domestic industries by making imported goods more expensive, thus encouraging local production. However, they often provoke retaliation. The European Union, for example, responded to Trump’s previous tariffs on steel and aluminium by imposing taxes on US products, including bourbon and motorcycles. China, too, has targeted American exports like soybeans and pork.Despite Trump’s claims that tariffs will create jobs, previous measures have had mixed results. A study by economists from MIT, Harvard, and the World Bank found that Trump’s first-term tariffs did not significantly boost US employment. While tariffs on imported steel were meant to protect American jobs, employment in the steel industry remained stagnant at around 140,000 workers.Democratic lawmakers argue that Trump’s tariffs serve primarily to fund tax cuts for the wealthy. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer called the measures ""a smokescreen for tax breaks that disproportionately benefit billionaires."" Even some Republicans acknowledge the potential economic turbulence, with House Speaker Mike Johnson admitting, ""It may be rocky in the beginning.""Economists predict a significant impact on American households. The Budget Lab at Yale University estimates that a 20% universal tariff would cost the average household an additional $3,400 to $4,200 per year. Trump argues that the policy will revitalise manufacturing and reduce the federal deficit, but many remain sceptical.","US President Donald Trump is set to announce sweeping new ""Liberation Day"" tariffs on Thursday.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country. He said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-105332515,imgsize-39018,width-400,resizemode-4/105332515.jpg"
E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran Udaan until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.Udaan built an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business still accounts for a very small part of India’s overall retail market but can balloon to $150 billion in sales and yield a 100% return on capital invested in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co. estimates published in the Mint newspaper.Bengaluru-based Udaan has also ventured into financing through its fintech unit which helps shopkeepers get working capital loans to buy inventory. That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says.

Space sector start-up Sisir Radar to develop SAR on L/P band SAR,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/space-sector-start-up-sisir-radar-to-develop-sar-on-l/p-band-sar/articleshow/104558111.cms,"CHENNAI: Space sector startup, Sisir Radar Private Ltd has hit success at the prestigious iDEX DefSpace Challenge with its projects for development of “L/P band Continuous Wave SAR (synthetic aperture radar) payload for LEO Small Satellites” and “Unfurlable, Electronically Steering Antenna for L/P band SAR payload” for Indian Air Force (IAF), said a top company official.The company is promoted by former Director at the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) Tapan Misra and the brains behind the Indian space agency’s RISAT series of SAR satellites as well as the Dual Frequency SAR on the Chandrayaan 2 orbiter that is currently circling the moon.""A grant of Rs 3 crore is also there for development of the products,"" Misra told IANS.Synthetic Aperture Radar or SAR is a special kind of imaging radar technology that can provide extremely accurate high resolution imagery of the terrain through clouds, smoke and dust even in pitch dark conditions. SAR imagery provides much higher resolution than other forms of remote sensing technology such as hyperspectral and multispectral. SAR is a critical technology for strategic reconnaissance and planning as well as for disaster management.According to Misra, winning the challenge in just over a year of floating the company is a major booster.He said L and P band SAR have an advantage over other frequencies (like X band) when it comes to penetration capabilities through rain, clouds, foliage and vegetation in a tropical country like India, and underground penetration capabilities in dry terrain.Continuing further, he said the L band SAR will provide 1 metre resolution, spotlight resolution in Stripmap mode. The current industry standard is 5-10 metre in L band. Misra said both the L and P band will operate simultaneously from a satellite borne SAR. Recently, Sisir Radar successfully developed and tested the world’s highest resolution L-Band SAR fitted on a drone. With 0.2 metre resolution, this is by far the highest L band SAR in the world, he said.","Space sector startup, Sisir Radar Private Ltd has hit success at the prestigious iDEX DefSpace Challenge.

Donald Trump's new Gold Card programme, offering a fast-track route to US residency, has sparked growing interest among Indians chasing the American dream, particularly after his administration hiked H-1B visa fees to $100,000.The Gold Card, signed into effect through an executive order on September 19, requires a non-refundable $1 million ""gift"" to the US Treasury, or $2 million through corporate sponsorship.Unlike the EB-5 investor visa, the scheme is positioned as a contribution to ""American industry and commerce.""Immigration firms say the demand has risen significantly since the H-1B overhaul. ""Interest has gone up sharply since the H-1B revisions,"" Sahil Nyati, founder of consultancy Jinee Green Card & Meritmap.ai, noting that most queries are from mid-career tech professionals in their 30s and 40s with STEM backgrounds told ET.The surge follows Trump’s move to raise H-1B visa fees to $100,000, a steep jump from the earlier $2,000–$5,000 range.

Prachi Shah, who runs an eponymous law firm, said interest among South Asian clients remains muted.She further noted, ""This is primarily due to the significant investment requirements and the perception that the Gold Card demands a non-refundable $1 million commitment.""Meanwhile, the administration is also considering a 'Trump Platinum Card', which would require a $5 million contribution for residency.

"EA Stocks: EA to go private in $55 billion buyout: Silver Lake, PIF, and Affinity Partners lead historic deal; ends 36-year public listing",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/ea-to-go-private-in-55-billion-buyout-silver-lake-pif-and-affinity-partners-lead-historic-deal-ends-36-year-public-listing/articleshow/124214457.cms,"



Electronic Arts (EA), the creator of globally popular video games including “Madden NFL,” “Battlefield,” and “The Sims,” is poised to exit public markets after agreeing to a $55 billion acquisition. The deal, one of the largest leveraged buyouts ever, will transfer EA into private ownership, giving the company room to restructure without the scrutiny of public investors.The transaction will see private equity firm Silver Lake Partners, Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund PIF, and Affinity Partners — led by Jared Kushner, President Donald Trump’s son-in-law — pay $210 per share to EA stockholders. This surpasses the $32 billion privatization of Texas utility TXU in 2007, AP reported.EA has been publicly traded for 36 years. Founded by former Apple employee William “Trip” Hawkins, the company went public seven years after its inception, closing its first trading day at a split-adjusted 52 cents per share. CEO Andrew Wilson has led the company since 2013.The buyout is part of a recent flurry of high-profile technology deals involving Silver Lake. The firm is also involved in a joint venture with Oracle to manage US operations of TikTok, though full details of that transaction remain undisclosed.Silver Lake has a history of taking major tech companies private, including Skype in 2009 for $1.9 billion and Dell in 2013 for $24.9 billion, which later returned to public markets in 2018.By going private, EA can reorient its operations without the pressure of meeting quarterly targets. The company’s revenues have remained steady over the past three fiscal years, fluctuating between $7.4 billion and $7.6 billion, even as its games maintain a loyal fan base.Competition in the gaming sector has intensified in recent years. Microsoft acquired rival Activision Blizzard for nearly $69 billion in 2023, and mobile gaming companies like Epic Games have expanded rapidly. Analysts suggest that privatization could allow EA to invest in innovation, streamline operations, and strengthen its market position.While privatizations often lead to layoffs, EA has not indicated any immediate workforce reductions. After trimming 5% of its staff in 2024, the company had 14,500 employees as of March 2025 and carried out further, limited layoffs in May.The acquisition is expected to provide EA the flexibility to restructure, enhance efficiency, and pursue long-term growth strategies without the constraints of public market expectations, potentially reshaping the competitive landscape of the global gaming industry.","Electronic Arts (EA), the creator of globally popular video games, is poised to exit public markets after agreeing to a $55 billion acquisition.

US government shutdown: What is happening and why is it important? Mass layoffs threatened,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-government-shutdown-what-is-happening-and-why-is-it-important-mass-layoffs-threatened/articleshow/124211920.cms,"What is a government shutdown?



Why is it happening now?



Earlier this week, Donald Trump cancelled talks with Democratic leaders, calling them “unserious” and not “productive”.

Democrats, led by Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer and House minority leader Hakeem Jeffries, accused Trump and Republicans – who control both chambers – of pushing the country towards a shutdown.

Last week, the Senate rejected competing short-term funding bills, while the Republican-controlled House passed one that nearly all Democrats opposed.

an extension of subsidies that lower health insurance costs under the Affordable Care Act,

a reversal of Medicaid cuts made in Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, and

the restoration of funding for public media.

Why is this shutdown more serious?



How will government departments function?



Department of education:

Department of defense:

Department of homeland security:

What could be the impact?



hundreds of thousands of employees may be furloughed or asked to work without pay,

services beyond the essential will be delayed or stopped,

public services like museums and parks could close, and

delays in inspections and hearings may frustrate the public.





The United States is once again staring at a possible government shutdown. Unless Congress agrees on a funding deal before midnight on September 30 large parts of the federal government will run out of money and be forced to close from October 1.Here’s what’s happening and why it matters.A shutdown takes place when lawmakers fail to pass a funding bill for the new fiscal year. Without that money, many federal agencies cannot function and must halt all non-essential work until Congress acts.Essential services, such as social security, the military, immigration enforcement and air traffic control, continue. Mail delivery also goes on as usual. But other areas face disruption. In the past, shutdowns have closed national parks and Smithsonian museums, delayed immigration hearings, slowed air travel and disrupted food safety checks.The longest shutdown so far lasted 34 days in 2018 under Donald Trump , leaving around 800,000 government workers without pay, according to The Guardian.In the US, the new fiscal year begins on October 1, but Democrats and Republicans are deeply divided.Democrats want more than just a temporary funding patch. They are demanding:Republicans have dismissed these demands. Senate majority leader John Thune told CNN they were “completely unhinged and unreasonable and unserious”.He added, “If they want to have a serious conversation, I think that I’m sure the president would be welcome or would be happy to do that.”Schumer hit back on X, saying, “What’s ‘unserious’ is ignoring the 93% spike for health insurance coming to Americans on November 1.”In a new step, the White House has told agencies to prepare not only for temporary furloughs but also for permanent layoffs. A memo from the Office of Management and Budget instructed departments to draw up redundancy notices for programmes that would lose funding and are “not consistent with the president’s priorities”.The OMB has already overseen workforce cuts under Trump’s efficiency drive led by Elon Musk’s “department of government efficiency”.Liz Shuler, president of the AFL-CIO, criticised the plan, saying workers had “already suffered immensely” from the administration’s cuts. “They are not pawns for the president’s political games,” she said, as quoted by The Guardian.Trump has insisted Democrats are to blame, “They never change,” he said.Jeffries replied that Democrats “will not be intimidated” by the threats. He had a blunt message for OMB chief Russell Vought: “Get lost.”In case the shutdown takes place, only a few DoE employers would continue working, as per the agency’s updated plan released on Sunday, CNN reported. Under the plan, almost 1,500 of the department’s 1,700 employees would be furloughed, along with about 650 of the 750 staff members at the Office of Federal Student Aid.According to the Pentagon’s contingency plan, around 224,000 of its more than 741,000 civilian staff would remain on duty to protect life and property, alongside nearly 2.1 million military personnel.If funding runs out, just 14,000 of the agency’s nearly 272,000 employees would be furloughed. Most staff in Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Transportation Security Administration, the Secret Service, Citizenship and Immigration Services, and FEMA would continue working, according to CNN.If the government shuts down:Economists say the wider economy may not feel the shock right away. But if the shutdown drags on, it could slow growth, unsettle markets and weaken public trust in government.","Congress must pass a funding bill for the new fiscal year by September 30.

Sensex falls for 7th day





MUMBAI: Gold and silver prices continued to record new all-time highs in the domestic market on Monday. It was backed by rallies in international prices on the likelihood of a US govt shutdown, trade-related jitters, and the continuing weakness of the rupee against major currencies.In the local spot market silver hovered around the Rs 1.5 lakh/kg mark, while gold was nearing the Rs 1.2 lakh/10gm mark. In international markets, the price of the yellow metal neared the $3,900/ounce (Oz) mark, a new all-time peak while the white metal traded above the $47/Oz mark after more than 13 years.The recent gains in gold and silver prices also came due to the expectation that US Federal Reserve will lower interest rates by an additional 50 basis points (100bps = 1 percentage point) this year, said Renisha Chainani of Augmont, a precious metals research and advisory firm.On Monday, silver in Delhi’s spot market went above the Rs 1.5-lakh-mark for the first time, an agency report said. In some other parts of India, the price of the white metal was slightly lower. on MCX, silver futures price for Dec delivery touched a high of Rs 1.44 lakh while for Sept 2026 delivery it was at Rs 1.5 lakh.In the spot market, gold prices traded above the Rs 1.15 lakh mark, a late evening report from India Bullion & Jewellers Association showed. On MCX, gold futures price for Oct delivery had breached the Rs 1.15 lakh mark, while for Dec delivery, the price was close to that level. Reports regarding US shut down also led to safe haven buying in precious metals and this could gain strength if the debt bill in the world’s largest economy is not passed before Oct 1, said Manav Modi, from Motilal Oswal Financial Services.After a bounce back in early trades, the sensex settled 62 points lower at 80,365 points on Monday as foreign funds continued to sell domestic shares.

Moody’s affirms India’s sovereign rating at ‘Baa3’





NEW DELHI: Moody’s Ratings on Monday affirmed India’s sovereign rating at Baa3 and maintained the outlook as stable, citing a fast-growing economy, sound external position, and a stable domestic financing base for ongoing fiscal deficits.The ratings agency said India was and will remain the fastest-growing G20 economy through at least the next two to three years. “We project economic growth to be sustained at 6.5% in fiscal 2025-26 as govt’s continued emphasis on capital expenditure, lower inflation, and the consequent easing of monetary policy will support robust domestic consumption and investment,” Moody’s Ratings said.It said that the US’s imposition of high tariffs (currently at 50%) will have limited negative effects on India’s economic growth in the near term. However, it cautioned that it may constrain potential growth over the medium to long term by hindering India’s ambitions to develop a higher value-added export manufacturing sector.Earlier, Morningstar, DBRS, and S&P Global Ratings upgraded India’s sovereign credit rating, and this was followed by Japanese credit ratings agency RI, which upgraded India from BBB to BBB+. The rating upgrades will help boost investor sentiment and ease borrowing costs for companies.The agency also said that at this stage, it expects subsequent negotiations between India and the US to result in less punitive rates and domestic market-oriented foreign investment to remain robust. “We do not expect other US policy shifts, including those related to new applications for skilled worker visas and potential levies on US businesses that outsource operations offshore, to significantly weigh on workers’ remittances or India’s services exports. Consequently, risks of a significant widening of India’s current account deficits will remain limited,” said Moody’s Ratings.The agency said that the stable outlook incorporates India’s gradually improving fiscal metrics and resilient growth prospects compared with peers. “However, fiscal accommodation in the context of the uncertain global macroeconomic outlook, including revenue-eroding measures, could impede progress towards debt reduction and exacerbate already weak debt affordability,” said Moody’s Ratings.","The ratings agency said India was and will remain the fastest-growing G20 economy through at least the next two to three years. “We project economic growth to be sustained at 6.5% in fiscal 2025-26 as govt’s continued emphasis on capital expenditure, lower inflation, and the consequent easing of monetary policy will support robust domestic consumption and investment,” it said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124223009,imgsize-535076,width-400,resizemode-4/growth-rep.jpg"

JLR plans phased restart of mfg ops





Moody’s Ratings on Monday changed Tata Motors ’ outlook to negative from positive following a cyber attack on its British arm Jaguar Land Rover, which has led to a complete production halt.The rating agency affirmed the Mumbai-based auto major’s Ba1 corporate family rating (CFR). “The outlook change to negative from positive reflects our view that a full recovery in credit metrics will likely take several months,” said Sweta Patodia of Moody’s. The cyber incident at JLR highlights the customer relations risk captured under social risk considerations within the ESG framework, and is the key driver of the rating action, she added.Following the demerger of the company’s commercial vehicle business, which takes effect on Oct 1, 2025, JLR will contribute more than 90% to its consolidated ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation), underscoring the convergence of their credit profiles, Moody’s Ratings stated. After the cyber incident, JLR’s operations have been disrupted for the last four weeks.Jaguar Land Rover will recommence some manufacturing operations in the forthcoming days, initiating agradual recovery in the aftermath of a cyberattack that occurred earlier this month. The announcement follows Britain’s commitment to support JLR with a $2-billion loan guarantee aimed at bolstering its supply chain in light of the production halt resulting from the attack.The company operates three factories in Britain, collectively producing about 1,000 vehicles daily.","The rating agency affirmed the Mumbai-based auto major’s Ba1 corporate family rating (CFR) “The outlook change to negative from positive reflects our view that a full recovery in credit metrics will likely take several months,” said Sweta Patodia of Moody's.

MUMBAI: RBI has set about easing lending norms while tightening its financial oversight. Its latest rules promise cheaper and more flexible loans for borrowers, wider access to credit against gold, and easier capital-raising avenues for banks.Draft proposals, meanwhile, would extend repayment terms, sharpen exposure limits and quicken credit reporting to bureaus to weekly from monthly —measures that collectively modernise bank lending.Late on Monday, RBI unveiled seven directions for lenders — three binding from Oct 1st and four open for consultation until Oct 20.The immediate changes grant banks more leeway in lending. Interest-rate spreads — the gap between the benchmark and loan rate — can be adjusted sooner, with certain borrower charges cut at any time rather than locked in for three years. Banks may also, if they wish, let personal-loan customers switch from floating to fixed rates at reset points — which is a flexibility and not a mandate.Gold and silver lending has been broadened. Working-capital loans, once limited to jewellers, can now flow to all manufacturers using bullion as raw material. Smaller urban co-operatives in tier-3 and -4 cities have been allowed into the business too, extending credit’s reach.Capital rules have been eased. RBI has relaxed restrictions on the use of foreign-currency and overseas-rupee bonds as additional tier-1 capital.","RBI unveils seven directions for lenders - three binding from Oct 1st and four open for consultation until Oct 20.

On a weeknight in a compact Mumbai kitchen, 29-year-old Justin whisks together a quick salad while his air fryer hums with sweet potato wedges. For him, cooking is less a chore and more a ritual, a way to unwind after work, entertain friends, and explore diverse flavours.Justin represents a growing tribe. Across urban India, men are stepping into kitchens with greater frequency, armed with sleek gadgets, high-performance cookware, and a desire to take charge of what’s on their plates.The shift isn’t just cultural, it’s commercial. Sales numbers tell the story. “About 30% of our online buyers today are men, and nearly 45% of our online traffic comes from male consumers. Five to six years ago, this was just a fraction,” says Stahl Kitchens CEO Dhruv Agarwal. He notes that households now make cookware decisions jointly, with both partners more willing to invest in premium products that promise durability and convenience. At Wonderchef, the trend is equally visible.“Men represent a much larger share of our buyers compared with five or six years ago. While women still make up the majority, the gap is narrowing as men increasingly purchase appliances and cookware for themselves,” says founder and CEO Ravi Saxena.What’s driving the change? Health consciousness, flexible work patterns, and easy recipes on social media. “With hectic lifestyles and high-intensity workouts, many men want greater control over what they eat: from reducing oil and avoiding processed foods to ensuring meals are cooked in safe cookware,” Saxena says.The shopping patterns reflect two broad groups. “Young, independent cooks, often living alone, buy one or two versatile, non-toxic cookware pieces to cook from scratch,” says Ember Cookware co-founder and CEO Siddharth Gadodia. “Then there are the passionate cooks, usually busy professionals who don’t cook daily but invest in premium sets to recreate family recipes or achieve restaurant-style results.” He notes that “about 70% of men who buy cookware use it themselves at least once a week. They also tend to opt for higher-value or complete sets, and their average order value is 12% higher than others”.Industry players say what appeals most male buyers are multi-functional devices and durable tools: kitchen robots that knead, chop, stir, steam, and cook; and tri-ply stainless steel woks.","Across urban India, men are stepping into kitchens with greater frequency.

MUMBAI: Tata Capital’s Rs 15,511-crore IPO — Tata Group’s biggest-ever and the largest by any NBFC — will be open between Oct 6-8, with anchor bids on Oct 3. Priced at Rs 310–326 a share, the offer values the firm at Rs 1.32–1.38 lakh crore. Investors must bid for at least 46 shares.At the floor, pricing matches Tata Sons ’ rights issue earlier this year — well below the grey-market frenzy that once saw trades over Rs 1,000 before Trump’s tariff tantrums roiled equities.The 47.6-crore-share issue comprises 21 crore fresh shares and a 26.6 crore offer for sale (OFS), leading to 11% dilution. Tata Sons will sell 23 crore shares, IFC 3.6 crore. Proceeds from the fresh issue will bolster Tata Capital’s tier-1 capital; OFS money goes to selling shareholders.“For 18 years, we funded the business with our own capital and were happy with the returns. The IPO is driven by regulatory timelines, though we were glad to support its growth,” said Saurabh Agarwal, group CFO Tata Sons and chairman Tata Capital. On a bank licence, he said: “That question comes up only as and when the corporate houses are allowed to own a bank.”“If India grows at 6.5–7%, credit will expand 11–12%. Retail and SME credit has been growing faster, at 17–18%.We are in the segment witnessing the strongest growth in the industry,” said Rajiv Sabharwal, MD & CEO, Tata Capital.Sabharwal sees Tata Capital riding the twin tailwinds of rapid GDP growth and low credit penetration, with NBFCs expanding faster than the broader market. The Tata brand’s reputation, along with the AAA domestic and sovereign-equivalent global ratings, gives the company a funding edge, enabling it to lend competitively. Its loan book is broad and granular — 88% in retail and SME, 99% of exposures under Rs 1 crore, and less than 12% unsecured.","Tata Capital’s Rs 15,511-crore IPO will be open between Oct 6-8, with anchor bids on Oct 3.

Power rebound





NEW DELHI: Industrial output growth moderated in Aug, led by manufacturing, which eased during the month after a robust outcome in July. Meanwhile, mining rebounded after four months, and the electricity sector rose to a five-month high.Data released by the National Statistics Office (NSO) on Monday showed the index of industrial production (IIP) rose an annual 4% in Aug, slightly lower than the upwardly revised 4.3% in July. It recorded flat growth in Aug 2024.The slowdown in the manufacturing sector impacted overall expansion as it recorded 3.8% growth in Aug, sharply lower than the 6% in July but higher than the 1.2% in Aug last year. In the manufacturing sector, “manufacture of basic metals” at 12.2% and motor vehicles, trailers, and semi-trailers at 9.8% recorded healthy growth.The mining sector grew by 6% in Aug, rising from a contraction of 7.2% in the previous month and a decline of 4.3% in Aug last year. “Notably, consumer non-durables witnessed the steepest contraction in eight months, while the growth in consumer durables halved to 3.5% from 7.3% in July 2025, which may reflect inventory management to avoid stranded taxes ahead of the GST rationalisation,” said Aditi Nayar, chief economist at ratings agency ICRA. Nayar said the infrastructure/construction goods output rose by double digits for the second consecutive month, suggesting that growth in construction activity is likely to have remained healthy.","Industrial output growth moderated in Aug, led by manufacturing, which eased during the month.

The TOI correspondent from Washington:

Trump Imposes 100% Tariff on Foreign Movies, Hollywood Stunned | WATCH





MAGA supremo Donald Trump on Monday announced a 100% tariff on “any and all movies that are made outside of the United States,” throwing the global entertainment industry, including global streaming services like Netflix and India’s “Bollywood,” into turmoil.In a trademark social media post, Trump claimed “our movie making business has been stolen from the United States of America, by other countries, just like stealing “candy from a baby"" and “in order to solve this long time, never-ending problem,” he will be imposing a 100% tax on movies made outside the US.The punitive move, practical implementation of which will prove to be a challenge since the movie business is largely universal and seamless, is certain to hurt India’s film industry – the world’s largest by volume – which derives significant revenues from the US, including via streaming services. Other major movie-making countries in Europe, Asia, and Australia will also be affected.Also read: 'We need to fix India': Howard Lutnick urges New Delhi to 'play ball' with Trump; 'avoid policies that harm US' For that matter, even Hollywood, which the US president is ostensibly trying to help, is likely to suffer, although Trump transparently put a political spin on the issue saying, “California, with its weak and incompetent governor, has been particularly hard hit!” – ostensibly because more and more movies and movie production have moved beyond the United States.Cross-border industry insiders acknowledge the US movie business is in crisis, but they are not sure how tariffs can be implemented. “We live in a world where movies are made across locations, across countries. A Hollywood animated movie could outsource special effects to a studio in India, but the colour correction could be done in another country and audio-video in a third. It is very complicated and there are many intangibles,"" says George Koshy, CEO of Infamous Coconut, an LA-based production company.India would be affected in two ways. Industry experts, such as the Producers Guild of India, estimate that Indian films gross approximately $100 million to $150 million annually from the U.S. (North America) market. The revenue comes from theatrical box office collections, as well as digital, satellite, and other distribution rights sold in the US. Major Hindi and Telugu blockbusters gross upwards of $10 million from the US market.As with tariffs on goods, the American consumer (mainly South Asians in the US) could end up footing the bill, paying double the current $20 for tickets and higher prices for subscription services. But the higher prices could also dampen demand and force producers to settle for less.Also read: Canada PM Mark Carney on Donald Trump's new H-1B visa policy: I understand you're changing your visa policy, maybe we can ... India will also be affected by Trump’s effort to reshore movie production since Hollywood studios like Disney, DreamWorks, and Pixar outsource a significant portion of the animation and visual effects (VFX) execution to studios in India. In recent years, Indian studios have handled post-production of movies such as The Lion King, Avengers: Endgame, Dune, Jungle Book, and Interstellar.Animation studios in India are also creating and co-producing TV series and feature films for international broadcasters like Disney and Nickelodeon. India's Animation and VFX sector is projected to grow from US$ 1.3 billion in 2023 to US$2.2 billion by 2026, according to a CII and India Brand Equity Foundation.In remarks on the issue in May when he first floated the idea of tariffing foreign films, Trump characterised the offshoring of movie production as a “threat to our nation” and accused foreign countries of “stealing our movie industry,” although Hollywood, like most other industries has moved out production to cut costs and improve bottomlines. If Trump goes through with the movie tariffs, other countries too could impose reciprocal tariffs on American films, devastating Hollywood. International markets account for over 70% of Hollywood's total box office revenue, which stood at around $ 30 billion in 2024.","US president Donald Trump on Monday announced a 100% tariff on “any and all movies that are made outside of the United States” The punitive move is certain to hurt India’s film industry, which derives significant revenues from the US.

China issued a strong protest on Monday against the United States' decision to broaden its export restriction catalogue, stating it would implement essential steps to protect Chinese companies' rightful interests.The United States implemented stricter controls on Monday targeting firms in China and various nations that employ subsidiary operations to circumvent limitations on semiconductor manufacturing equipment and associated technologies.The Chinese Ministry of Commerce released a statement demanding Washington to ""immediately correct its wrongful action"" and cease its ""unreasonable suppression of Chinese enterprises"".The comes after US on Monday tightened restrictions on companies in China and other countries that use subsidiaries to circumvent existing curbs on chipmaking equipment and other technology.The Commerce Department issued a new rule expanding its restricted export list, known as the Entity List, to automatically include subsidiaries that are 50 percent or more owned by a company already on the list, according to a posting in the US Federal Register.The move significantly increases the number of companies that require licenses to receive American goods and services.The rule is expected to disrupt supply chains and complicate efforts by companies to determine whether exports to a customer or supplier are restricted. Certain transactions may still be allowed for 60 days, the posting noted, as reported by Reuters.The affiliates rule is modeled on the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control “50 percent rule” for sanctioned entities. Under the Commerce Department rule, “If a company is owned 50 percent or more by an entity on the list, licenses will be required for US exporters to ship goods or technology to the subsidiary, just as they are for listed entities, with many licenses likely to be denied.”","The Chinese Ministry of Commerce released a statement demanding Washington to ""immediately correct its wrongful action"" and cease its ""unreasonable suppression of Chinese enterprises"" Comes after US on Monday tightened restrictions on companies in China and other countries that use subsidiaries to circumvent existing curbs on chipmaking equipment and other technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124216007,imgsize-117000,width-400,resizemode-4/i-present-china-us-diplomacy.jpg"

US stocks opened higher on Monday, clawing back some losses from last week, with investors eyeing a key economic report and ongoing political uncertainty over a potential government shutdown. The S&P 500 rose 0.4% in early trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average edged up 29 points (0.1%), and the Nasdaq composite gained 0.6%, all hovering near last week’s record highs, AP reported.Electronic Arts shares jumped 5.7% after confirming it would be taken private in a $55 billion buyout, potentially the largest-ever leveraged acquisition of a publicly traded company. British pharmaceutical giant GSK’s shares gained 2.8% following the announcement that CEO Emma Walmsley will step down on December 31, with Luke Miels set to take over.Futures indicated further early gains, with S&P 500 futures up 0.5%, Dow futures 0.4%, and Nasdaq futures 0.6%, as investors weighed the possibility of a US government shutdown on Wednesday. While political impasses have historically had limited impact on markets, a shutdown could delay the release of government data crucial for traders, economists, and the Federal Reserve in assessing the health of the economy.Investors are also focused on the September jobs report, scheduled for release on Friday, as the Fed monitors inflation and the labor market. Last week, data showed US inflation accelerated to 2.7% in August from 2.6% in July, raising hopes that the Federal Reserve may continue easing interest rates to support growth.However, rising tariffs announced by President Donald Trump—including levies on pharmaceuticals, kitchen cabinets, furniture, and heavy trucks effective October 1—pose additional inflationary pressures that could affect consumer spending.In overseas markets, European indices showed modest gains, with Paris’ CAC 40 up 0.2% and London’s FTSE 100 rising 0.4%, while Germany’s DAX remained flat.

US President Donald Trump announced that he plans to impose sweeping tariffs on foreign-made movies and furniture, accusing other countries of “stealing” from the United States.In one post on Truth Social, Trump wrote: “Our movie making business has been stolen from the United States of America, by other Countries, just like stealing ‘candy from a baby.’ California, with its weak and incompetent Governor, has been particularly hard hit!

Details to follow!!!”Notably the US president has not announced the details for when these tariffs will be implemented.The announcements come amid Trump’s ongoing focus on domestic industry and protectionist trade policies, with the help of tariffs.

German aviation giant Lufthansa is planning to slash almost 4,000 jobs by 2030, mostly in Germany, as a part of wider efforts to reduce costs after a drop in earnings.Europe’s biggest airline group on Monday announced that the cuts will largely affect administrative roles, leaving pilots and other operational staff largely untouched, AFP reported. Lufthansa’s group also includes Eurowings, Austrian, Swiss, and Brussels Airlines.The move comes ahead of Lufthansa’s first company-wide Capital Markets Day in six years, where the airline aims to show investors it is serious about improving efficiency.Investors have criticised Lufthansa for struggling to cut costs and grow its main business, as per a Reuters report. The airline missed its target of an 8% operating profit margin by 2025 and issued two profit warnings in 2024, prompting promises of a major turnaround programme. Some employees were already informed of the planned cuts last Friday.""All this will require us also to become leaner in admin because we cannot afford to maintain our work at the cost that we have now because we don't have the margins to invest,"" CEO Carsten Spohr said at a staff town hall.""And in our industry, without modern technology, you have no chance.""Reuters had earlier reported that any cuts will affect the entire group, not just Lufthansa’s core airline.Analysts also note that, despite fewer planes than in 2019, Lufthansa now employs 7% more staff.The airline’s turnaround strategy relies heavily on its newer subsidiaries, Discover and City Airlines, which have more flexible labour agreements than Lufthansa Classic. Executives hope this will allow resources to shift to lower-cost operations.""Analysts may also look for assurance that Lufthansa is still on track for its 2025 guidance for a significant increase in adjusted EBIT,"" said RBC analyst Ruairi Cullinane.","Lufthansa is planning to slash almost 4,000 jobs by 2030, mostly in Germany.

The rebound came after the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index, rose 2.7 percent in August, slightly higher than July’s 2.6 percent but above the Fed’s two percent target.With a Tuesday deadline approaching, congressional leaders are set to meet President Trump to try and resolve the funding impasse, which could result in partial government closures. Democratic House leader Hakeem Jeffries told ABC he was “hopeful” a deal could be reached before the cutoff, while Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer echoed cautious optimism, noting that any progress would depend on Trump’s Republicans.Trump has maintained a firm stance on his agenda, cancelling a meeting last week with senior opposition leaders. That discussion is now scheduled for Monday.Despite the political uncertainty, most Asian markets remained positive.Oil prices fell on speculation that OPEC+ may raise output, raising concerns about oversupply.The drop came after last week’s rally, which had been fuelled by growing tensions between Nato countries and Russia, with the threat of fresh sanctions on Moscow.","All three major US indexes closed higher on Friday, breaking a three-day losing streak.

MOSCOW/LONDON: Opec+ will likely approve another oil production increase of at least 137,000 barrels per day at its meeting next Sunday, as rising oil prices encourage the group to try to further regain market share, three sources familiar with the talks said.Opec+ has reversed its strategy of output cuts from April and has already raised quotas by more than 2.5 million barrels per day, representing about 2.4% of world demand, to boost market share and after coming under pressure from US President Donald Trump to lower oil prices.Eight Opec+ countries will hold an online meeting on Oct 5 to decide on Nov output. Opec+ pumps about half of the world's oil and includes the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries plus Russia and other allies.Opec headquarters and authorities in Saudi Arabia did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Oil prices have fallen from over $80 per barrel at the start of the year but have mostly traded in a narrow range of $60-$70 per barrel since Opec began production increases in April.On Friday, prices rose to their highest since Aug 1, hitting levels above $70 per barrel, supported by Ukrainian drone attacks on Russia's energy infrastructure.",Opec+ has reversed its strategy of output cuts from April and has already raised quotas by more than 2.5 million barrels per day.

The government announced a Rs 70,000-crore ($8 billion) package to revitalize domestic shipyards, boost India’s maritime ecosystem, and reduce the country’s heavy reliance on foreign vessels, which currently handle about 95% of its import-export trade.The plan includes a maritime development fund, a revamped shipbuilding assistance scheme, and incentives for South Korean and Japanese shipbuilders to establish operations in India, either independently or in partnership with local shipyards.The move aims not only to attract global investment but also to reduce India's dependence on foreign ships, and strengthen long-term maritime security.""With this new package, it's like the Maruti moment for shipbuilding,"" TK Ramachandran , secretary at the Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Waterways told ET.""But we have to create major domestic demand for ships to make these incentives work,"" Ramachandran added.India currently spends around $75 billion annually on hiring foreign ships—a figure that could surge to $400 billion by 2047 if domestic shipbuilding capacity is not expanded.Highlighting the strategic importance of the initiative, M Angamuthu, Chairperson of Mumbai Port Authority, said India’s reliance on foreign vessels leaves the nation vulnerable during global disruptions such as pandemics, wars, or sanctions.""A robust Indian fleet is essential to ensure continuity and sovereign control over the country’s critical supply chains,"" he added.Currently, India owns just 1,500 ships, with only 220 operating overseas for EXIM trade. The country has barely a dozen shipyards capable of building ocean-going vessels, producing less than 1% of global shipbuilding, compared with China’s 70% share, followed by South Korea and Japan.Ramachandran noted that the government has been in talks with several Korean and Japanese shipbuilders, many of whom are currently operating at full capacity.""They are choker-blocked with orders until 2028 or even 2029, so they are seeking alternative locations to build ships. With this incentive package, India is well positioned to attract them,"" he added.Notable Korean shipbuilders include Samsung Heavy Industries, Hyundai Heavy Industries, Hanwha Ocean, and HD Korea Shipbuilding, while prominent Japanese firms such as Mitsubishi, Hitachi, and Kawasaki are also active in global shipbuilding.","The government announced a Rs 70,000-crore ($8 billion) package to revitalize domestic shipyards.

Russia COOKS West In Fiery Showdown Over Iran Sanctions; Lavrov, Aide Vs E3 | Saudi Also Jumps In

What the sanctions cover?

An arms embargo banning the sale or transfer of conventional weapons to Iran.

Prohibition on imports, exports, or transfers of technologies connected to nuclear and missile programs.

Freezing of assets abroad belonging to individuals or groups tied to prohibited activities.

Travel bans for designated individuals.

Restrictions on access to banking and financial systems that could aid Tehran’s nuclear or missile ambitions.

What happens if sanctions are violated?

How the 'Snapback' works?

Iran rejects sanctions as “illegal”

Western powers call for dialogue





A wide range of UN sanctions on Iran’s nuclear program, previously lifted under the 2015 nuclear deal, were reimposed late Saturday after Britain, France, and Germany triggered the agreement’s “snapback” mechanism, accusing Tehran of failing to meet its commitments.The sanctions, which directly target Iran’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs, come at a tense moment following the collapse of negotiations with Western powers and recent strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities by the United States and Israel.The restored sanctions place sweeping restrictions on Iran’s economy. They target companies, individuals, and organizations linked to nuclear or missile development, prohibiting the supply of equipment, expertise, or financial support.The key measures include:Any violation of the UN sanctions could trigger worldwide asset freezes. Alongside the UN measures, the European Union is expected to revive its own sanctions that were suspended under the 2015 accord. Their goal is not only to curb Iran’s nuclear activities but also to put financial pressure on Tehran to return to compliance, AFP reported.The United States already enforces its own tough sanctions.Since President Donald Trump withdrew from the nuclear deal during his first term, Washington has prohibited other nations from buying Iranian oil—crippling one of Tehran’s key revenue streams.The “snapback” mechanism restores earlier UN resolutions that were lifted under the nuclear deal. However, practical enforcement depends on member states updating their national laws.While the sanctions are legally binding, implementation is uneven. Some nations, including China, have continued trading with Iran despite US sanctions. Western officials expect Russia to ignore the snapback as well, leaving uncertainty over Beijing’s response, given its reliance on Iranian oil.Iran has strongly condemned the reimposed sanctions, calling them “unjustifiable” and “legally baseless.”“The reactivation of annulled resolutions is legally baseless and unjustifiable… all countries must refrain from recognising this illegal situation,” the Iranian foreign ministry said in a statement.Tehran vowed to defend its interests, warning that “any action aimed at undermining the rights and interests of its people will face a firm and appropriate response.”Despite the reimposition, Western leaders insisted that channels for diplomacy remain open. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio urged Tehran to return to talks, saying, “Accept direct talks, held in good faith.”He also pressed UN members to implement sanctions immediately to “pressure Iran’s leaders to do what is right for their nation, and best for the safety of the world.”In a joint statement, the foreign ministers of Britain, France, and Germany reiterated their commitment to pursuing a new diplomatic solution, AFP reported.“We will continue to seek a new diplomatic solution to ensure Iran never gets a nuclear weapon,” they said, urging Tehran to avoid escalation. The reinstatement of sanctions marks the collapse of months of delicate diplomacy since negotiations broke down in June.","Britain, France, and Germany reimposed UN sanctions on Iran late Saturday.

‘Betrayal’: Iran Slams Europe Over Snapback Sanctions Ahead Of Crucial UN Security Council Clash





The United Nations has reimposed wide-ranging sanctions on Iran over its nuclear programme, further tightening the squeeze on the Islamic Republic as it grapples with soaring food prices, currency collapse and fears of renewed conflict with Israel and the United States.According to news agency Associated Press (AP), the sanctions—revived through a “snapback” mechanism from the 2015 nuclear accord—took effect early Sunday.They will freeze Iranian assets abroad, block arms deals, and penalise Tehran’s ballistic missile development.France, Germany and the United Kingdom triggered the snapback after accusing Iran of restricting monitoring by the International Atomic Energy Agency and failing to account for its growing stockpile of highly enriched uranium.Iran has long maintained its programme is peaceful, though the West and the IAEA believe it had organised weapons work until 2003. As per AP, Iran still holds uranium enriched up to 60% purity, close to weapons-grade levels, enough to produce several bombs should it decide to pursue weaponisation.The economic toll is already severe. The rial hit record lows, pushing up prices of staples like rice and meat.Inflation officially stands at 34.5%, with food costs up more than 50%.“Every day I see new higher prices for cheese, milk and butter. I cannot omit them like fruits and meat because my kids are too young to be deprived,” said Tehran resident Sima Taghavi, as cited by AP.Another, identified only as Sina, described conditions as worse than during the 1980s Iran-Iraq war, “For my generation, it’s always either too late or too early—our dreams are slipping away.”The measures mark the first time in a decade that UN sanctions have returned. US secretary of state Marco Rubio urged Iran to “accept direct talks, held in good faith,” while Britain, France and Germany said they remain open to diplomacy.Germany’s foreign minister Johann Wadephul told the UN General Assembly that “Iran must never acquire a nuclear weapon,” stressing sanctions were triggered due to Tehran’s non-compliance.Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian rejected US proposals to surrender enriched uranium for limited reprieve, calling them unacceptable. Tehran recalled its envoys from Britain, France and Germany in protest.Russia, however, said it would not enforce the sanctions, with foreign minister Sergey Lavrov describing them as “blackmail and pressure.”Meanwhile, fears of escalation loom. As per AP, missile sites destroyed during the 12-day war in June appear to be rebuilt, raising risks of renewed clashes.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told the UN that sanctions should not be delayed and signalled Israel could take further military action.As per AFP, Iranians are rushing to buy gold as the rial plunged to 1.12 million to the dollar on the black market. One engineer, Dariush, was quoted by AFP as saying, “The impact of the renewed sanctions is already evident: the exchange rate is increasing, and this is leading to higher prices. Our standard of living is much lower than two or three years ago.”Human rights groups also warn of intensifying repression. Executions in 2025 have already surpassed 1,000, the highest since 1988, amid unrest over economic hardships and political demands.With sanctions back in force and diplomacy uncertain, the Iranian people face what one psychologist described to Hamshahri newspaper as a society “exhausted and unmotivated”—caught between international isolation, internal crackdowns, and fears of another war.","The United Nations has reimposed wide-ranging sanctions on Iran over its nuclear programme.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021.

Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran Udaan until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.Udaan built an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business still accounts for a very small part of India’s overall retail market but can balloon to $150 billion in sales and yield a 100% return on capital invested in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co. estimates published in the Mint newspaper.Bengaluru-based Udaan has also ventured into financing through its fintech unit which helps shopkeepers get working capital loans to buy inventory. That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says.

SAR imagery provides much higher resolution than other forms of remote sensing technology such as hyperspectral and multispectral. SAR is a critical technology for strategic reconnaissance and planning as well as for disaster management.According to Misra, winning the challenge in just over a year of floating the company is a major booster.He said L and P band SAR have an advantage over other frequencies (like X band) when it comes to penetration capabilities through rain, clouds, foliage and vegetation in a tropical country like India, and underground penetration capabilities in dry terrain.Continuing further, he said the L band SAR will provide 1 metre resolution, spotlight resolution in Stripmap mode. The current industry standard is 5-10 metre in L band. Misra said both the L and P band will operate simultaneously from a satellite borne SAR. Recently, Sisir Radar successfully developed and tested the world’s highest resolution L-Band SAR fitted on a drone. With 0.2 metre resolution, this is by far the highest L band SAR in the world, he said.","Space sector startup, Sisir Radar Private Ltd has hit success at the prestigious iDEX DefSpace Challenge.

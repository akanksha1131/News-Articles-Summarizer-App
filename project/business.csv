Financial services as a growth engine: What Budget 2026 must deliver,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/financial-services-as-a-growth-engine-what-budget-2026-must-deliver/articleshow/127641361.cms,"A modern, fast‑growing economy depends on strong financial intermediaries.

By Jugal Kajaria

Deloitte Partner Says Budget Must Fix GST Gaps, Cut Costs, Boost Domestic Manufacturing

(Jugal Kajaria is Tax Partner – EY India. With Inputs from Darshil Shah, Tax Professional, EY India)

India stands at a pivotal moment as Budget 2026 approaches, and few sectors can accelerate growth as powerfully as Financial Services (FS). India’s real GDP growth is estimated at 7.4% in FY26 led by investment demand and services sector growth. More than a system of payments or lending, the FS sector today acts as the economy’s central engine by allocating capital, pricing risk, and transmitting policy signals across the real economy. When this engine operates efficiently, it amplifies growth across infrastructure, manufacturing, MSMEs, households, and the expanding footprints of the digital ecosystem.A modern, fast‑growing economy depends on strong financial intermediaries. In India, banks, NBFCs, insurers, pension funds, mutual funds, and capital markets channel household and institutional savings into productive investments across the economy. This steady flow of capital drives GDP growth, improves productivity, formalises activity, and supports MSMEs and start‑ups through credit, funding, and risk‑mitigation tools. To sustain this momentum, Budget 2026 must focus on strengthening credit systems, deepening markets, and ensuring a predictable and innovation‑friendly regulatory environment.Continuity of the pace of tax reforms with the mantra of ‘simplification’ being the core objective will play a vital role in shaping India’s competitiveness as a global financial hub. A rationalisation of the tax regime for foreign bank branches—which currently face an effective tax rate of 38.22 percent -- would create a more balanced environment for global institutions. Extending withholding tax exemption on interest received to NBFCs similar to the exemption provided to Banks would introduce operational efficiency and arrest cash flow leakages for NBFCs helping them focus on greater penetration.Judicial clarity and global alignment are equally important. Recent Supreme Court rulings in the Tiger Global and American Express have implications for foreign investors and foreign banks. The global investor community is looking at clear and upfront tax guidance which would provide the predictability needed for investment decisions. The global investor community would be keenly looking at how the Hon’ble Finance Minister balances the expectations of the global investor community in respect of their past as well as the future investments.Alongside these reforms, India has been gaining prominence as an emerging international financial services centre (IFSC) through the development of GIFT City. Past Budgets have provided regulatory and tax relaxations that have enabled strong and steady progress. Global and Indian investors are regularly coming up with newer business models in GIFT City, which needs regulatory and tax amendments for enabling the same. Continuing with the past practice, Budget 2026 should continue to promote GIFT City for development of new business activities and products in GIFT City. The emerging areas of Global / Regional Treasury Centres, Commodity Trading, and Oilfield Equipment leasing will be eagerly looking up to Budget 2026 for regulatory support and tax clarity.Notifying the framework for Variable Capital Company structures would significantly widen the range of fund‑management activities within the IFSC. As the re‑insurance market in GIFT City continues to expand, it will be important to ensure a level playing field for Lloyd’s syndicates to attract larger pools of global capacity. Collectively, these reforms can materially enhance GIFT City’s attractiveness for banks, asset managers, treasury centres, insurers, leasing platforms, and other cross‑border financial participants.Similar to recent Budgets, timely disposal of tax assessments and appeals must remain a priority. With about INR 26.3 lakh crore—around 8 percent of India’s GDP—locked in income‑tax disputes, direct‑tax litigation continues to be a major concern. This issue is particularly significant for the FS sector, where cases often involve legacy matters that require clear and consistent guidance from tax authorities and take years to be resolved. Establishing defined timelines and accountability frameworks would enhance trust and reduce uncertainty for financial institutions and investors.To conclude, India’s FS sector is positioned to power the nation’s next phase of growth. Budget 2026 can accelerate this transition by pairing targeted policy support with competitive tax rules. Strengthening FS institutions, deepening markets, and improving digital and regulatory architecture will expand the economy’s credit capacity, strengthen inclusion, and reinforce India’s emergence as a global financial hub—creating the investment foundation needed for sustainable and long‑term growth. These financial sector reforms will go a long way in not only sustaining GDP growth but also in boosting the per capita income of India’s population.","India’s real GDP growth is estimated at 7.4% in FY26 led by investment demand and services sector growth.

The US Federal Reserve on Wednesday left interest rates unchanged, holding its benchmark lending rate at 3.5% to 3.75%.The decision was not unanimous. Governors Christopher Waller and Stephen Miran dissented, favouring a quarter-point rate cut.The decision comes after the central bank cut rates at three consecutive meetings late last year. Fed officials have said they want time to see how those cuts affect the economy before considering any further reduction, signalling that rates could stay on hold for the next few months.The pause was widely expected. While concerns over a slowing labour market had earlier pushed the Fed to cut rates, recent economic data has been more mixed. Growth has been stronger than expected, unemployment remains low, and inflation continues to stay above the central bank’s comfort level.The Fed’s cautious approach comes amid renewed political pressure. President Donald Trump has repeatedly argued that interest rates should be cut more aggressively. Since returning to office last year, he has stepped up criticism of the central bank, drawing warnings from officials about the need to protect its independence.Trump has called for the removal of Fed Governor Lisa Cook, citing allegations of mortgage fraud, and his administration has launched an inquiry into Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell over renovations at the central bank’s headquarters.Earlier this month, Powell responded strongly to the criticism, warning against threats of criminal prosecution and raising concerns about whether monetary policy decisions could be influenced by political pressure.","US Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged, holding its benchmark lending rate at 3.5% to 3.75%.

Gold and silver prices continued to scale lifetime highs on Wednesday, lifted by safe have demand amid ongoing geopolitical tensions. The precious metals continued to reach record levels on the Multi-Commodity Exchange(MCX) as the white metal nears the Rs 4 lakh mark and gold jumps 3%.The momentum comes just ahead of the US Federal Reserve’s policy announcement, which is being closely watched by global investors.Gold futures expiring on February 5, 2026, climbed sharply in early trade, rising Rs 4,800, or 3%, to Rs 1,62,429 per 10 grams. Silver futures for March 5, 2026, delivery posted even steeper gains, jumping Rs 21,400, or 6%, to Rs 3,77,655 per kg, marking fresh lifetime highs for both contracts on the MCX.Global markets followed the strength seen domestically. International gold prices crossed the $5,200-an-ounce mark on Wednesday, touching an all-time high as the US dollar weakened to a near four-year low amid persistent geopolitical concerns. The rally unfolded ahead of the US Federal Reserve’s monetary policy decision later in the day. Spot silver rose 0.6% to $113.63 an ounce, after having touched a record high of $117.69 on Monday.Silver has already gained nearly 60% so far this year.Market participants are now awaiting cues from the Federal Reserve, with any indication of a pause or easing in interest rates expected to influence broader sentiment. Lower interest rates generally weigh on bond yields, making non-yielding assets such as gold and silver more attractive to investors.Strong safe-haven buying driven by heightened global uncertainty continues to support precious metals, Manoj Kumar Jain of Prithvi Finmart told ET. He noted that the dollar index has seen a sharp decline, slipping to nearly a four-year low. A rebound in the Japanese yen and concerns over the possible dumping of US Treasuries by European countries amid the Greenland issue are adding further pressure on the dollar. While the overall environment remains supportive for gold and silver, price action is expected to remain highly volatile.Despite the volatility, silver is expected to hold a crucial support level at $98 per troy ounce, while gold is likely to sustain support near $4,980 per troy ounce on a closing basis during the week.In the near term, both metals are expected to witness sharp fluctuations, tracking movements in the dollar index, the outcome of the Fed policy meeting and ongoing geopolitical developments. Gold has support in the $5,084–$5,055 range and faces resistance between $5,174 and $5,220 per troy ounce. Silver is supported at $102.40–$98 and encounters resistance in the $112–$118 range, Manoj added.On the MCX, gold is expected to find support at Rs 1,56,600–Rs 1,55,000, while resistance is placed at Rs 1,59,800–Rs 1,62,000. Silver has support at Rs 3,50,000–Rs 3,44,000 and resistance between Rs 3,65,000 and Rs 3,78,000.The trading strategy is to buy the yellow metal on dips as long as it holds Rs 1,56,000 on a closing basis, targeting Rs 1,65,000. Silver can also be accumulated on falls while it sustains Rs 3,44,000 on a closing basis, with an upside target of Rs 3,70,000–Rs 3,84,000.","Gold futures expiring on February 5, 2026, climbed sharply in early trade, rising Rs 4,800, or 3%, to Rs 1,62,429 per 10 grams.

'Not Symbolic, But Substantive': India’s AI Summit Puts Global South At Centre Of World AI Agenda

Bengaluru: As AI adoption accelerates globally, Infosys and EkStep cofounder Nandan Nilekani said India must position itself firmly in the race to the top, using AI to improve livelihoods and create real economic value.“There is a race in AI—a race to the bottom and a race to the top. The race to the bottom is what we mostly see today: AI stock pornography, people preying on loneliness, mental health, and so on. The race to the top is about how we use AI to improve livelihoods. We want the race to the top to win,” Nilekani said at an event hosted by the EkStep Foundation in Bengaluru on Wednesday. The event showcased India’s diverse voice AI use cases and deployments across govt services, agriculture, financial services, logistics, the judiciary, and enterprise operations.Nilekani emphasised the need for guardrails, saying the focus should be on responsible AI that works as intended, avoids hallucinations and stays within clear boundaries, rather than on extreme fears about superintelligence. “The AI community talks about how AI will eliminate jobs, make everyone so productive that they can sit on a beach, get stablecoins into a digital wallet, drink margaritas, and play video games ..... These are all grand claims,” he said.Referring to Aadhaar’s success, Nilekani said India proved it can build population-scale digital infrastructure with frugal design so that 1 billion people can benefit. “UPI does over 20 billion transactions at near-zero cost. A vegetable vendor can sell produce and get paid without paying a transaction fee. That’s what we need to do again — by tweaking models, designing chips better for our needs — it doesn’t matter how. That’s the game. And you’ll see this happening over the next two years, and this community will make it happen.”Nilekani also emphasised that voice-based AI is the most practical interface for India and a critical step towards digital equity. “Just as UPI made digital payments effortless for everyone, voice-driven interfaces can remove barriers to opportunity in sectors, such as agriculture, education, and others for every citizen. Literacy will no longer be a barrier.”Vishal Dhupar, MD for South Asia at Nvidia, said India is moving towards becoming a global hub for intelligence. “Bengaluru can become a global hub for intelligence — not as a cliché, but because we are already playing the game. As you move from practice to the professional league, the canvas gets bigger, you learn the nuances, and you get better. Talent and infrastructure will come here. I see a 3x opportunity for India over the next three-to-four years,” he said.","Nandan Nilekani said India must position itself firmly in the race to the top, using AI to improve livelihoods and create real economic value.

‘Sour grapes?’ Piyush Goyal hits back at Congress for calling India-EU FTA deal 'hugely-hyped',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sour-grapes-piyush-goyal-hits-back-at-congress-for-calling-india-eu-fta-deal-hugely-hyped/articleshow/127751532.cms,"NEW DELHI: Commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal on Wednesday strongly rebutted Congress leader Jairam Ramesh’s criticism of the India-European Union free trade agreement (FTA), questioning the opposition’s credibility and defending the pact as a landmark, win-win economic deal that could unlock major growth and employment opportunities for India.Responding to an X post by Ramesh that termed the FTA “hugely hyped” and raised concerns over trade deficits, Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), automobiles, intellectual property and refined fuel exports, Goyal described the criticism as politically motivated and disconnected from economic realities.“Is this a story of ‘Sour grapes’?” Goyal asked, adding that those who failed to take decisions when in power were now “making a virtue of not doing anything”. He said India had paid a “heavy cost” for the suspension of FTA talks between 2013 and 2022, including lost jobs, income and growth.Rejecting claims that the agreement was over-sold, Goyal said the scale of the pact spoke for itself. “When the whole world is calling it the ‘mother of all deals’, my friend thinks it is hugely hyped,” he said, pointing to the combined GDP of $25 trillion, global trade of $11 trillion and a common market of nearly two billion people.He added that tariff elimination on $33 billion worth of India’s labour-intensive exports from day one could not be dismissed as hype.Ramesh, in his post, had argued that the FTA represents “the biggest trade opening India has given to any trade partner”, with tariff reductions on over 96 per cent of EU exports to India, and warned that it could double imports from the bloc, widening the trade deficit. He flagged the lack of an exemption for India’s aluminium and steel exports from the EU’s CBAM, noting that exports in these sectors had already declined from $7 billion to $5 billion and could fall further after CBAM’s enforcement from January 1, 2026.Goyal countered this by saying the government had engaged proactively on CBAM and other sensitive issues. “I can say with confidence that our Government has taken up the issue of CBAM… and identified pathways to find solutions,” he said, stressing dialogue and cooperation rather than rigid positions.Addressing concerns on regulatory barriers, Goyal said health and safety regulations were preserved under the agreement and disciplined to prevent unjustified trade restrictions. On intellectual property, he said obligations were aligned with WTO’s TRIPS framework, emphasising public health flexibilities, technology transfer, recognition of India’s traditional digital knowledge library, and preservation of India’s data exclusivity policy.On services, where Ramesh alleged the EU had sought privileged access beyond India’s commitments with other partners, Goyal said commitments remained within India’s domestic regime and could attract EU investment and innovation in sectors such as maritime and financial services.The minister also defended the inclusion of automobiles in the FTA, a key concern raised by the Congress leader, particularly for domestic manufacturers and the emerging electric vehicle (EV) industry.Goyal said India’s offer was quota-based, focused on the premium segment and phased, with a five-year lag for EVs. Liberalising CKD imports, he said, would encourage European OEMs to set up local assembly lines, moving from importing to full localisation and strengthening the Make in India ecosystem.Responding to questions on refined fuel exports – India’s largest export to the EU – Goyal said the issue was linked to extraneous factors and that the trade agreement was a long-term strategic engagement based on trust and mutual respect.“I only hope my friend will shed this negative and pessimistic approach… Let’s work to open opportunities for them, rather than act as roadblocks in their quest for prosperity,” Goyal said.India and the EU began FTA negotiations in 2007, completing 16 rounds before talks were suspended in 2013 over unresolved issues. Negotiations resumed in June 2022 and were finalised and announced on Tuesday, 18-years after it all began.", Commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal strongly rebutted Congress leader Jairam Ramesh’s criticism of the India-European Union free trade agreement (FTA) Goyal described the criticism as politically motivated and disconnected from economic realities.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127753317,imgsize-996531,width-400,resizemode-4/piyush-goyal-signing-deal-with-eu-ani.jpg"

Nifty saw over 400 points recovery from its lows printed on Monday while facing marginal supply near its initial pullback target of 25350. Sustained trade above 25350 is now likely to allow for further short covering to 25350 while dips below 25200 are now likely to get bought into. Past 2 day’s price action suggests a follow through as the 200 DMA has been reclaimed. A decisive up move in this set up is unlikely to be seen unless a weekly closing above 25660 is confirmed. The range of 25250 - 25600 is likely to continue ahead of the Budget Session.Bank Nifty after breaking below its recent swing low on Monday outperformed Nifty by a wide in the first two days of this week. A fresh round of covering is visible on closing above 59600 odd which could put the index back in the driver's seat to outperform against the Nifty.After completing 100% of its bullish flag target, COALINDIA is now moving further to attain its 161.8% extension on Fibonacci scale given the money flow acting as tailwind in PSU names.

Stock market today: Nifty50 and BSE Sensex , the Indian equity benchmarks, opened in red on Thursday on weak global cues. While Nifty50 went below 25,200, BSE Sensex was down over 500 points. At 10:00 AM, Nifty50 was trading at 25,182.10, down 160 points or 0.63%. BSE Sensex was at 81,780.34, down 564.34 points or 0.69%.Analysts are of the view that stock markets may extend their recent gains, on the back of improving sentiment around the India-EU free trade agreement talks and anticipation ahead of the upcoming Union Budget. Domestic markets are also likely to take cues from global trends and ongoing third-quarter earnings announcements. Reports of the India-US trade deal talks progressing well, may also bolster the stock markets.Dr. VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Investments Limited says, “Nifty’s up move of 300 points during the last two days should be seen more as a temporary response in anticipation of the Budget to be presented on Sunday. Since the bears won’t risk going into the Budget with huge open short positions, they have covered some shorts and this has contributed to the 300 point rally in the Nifty.It is important to note that there is no change in the short to medium-term strategy of FIIs, which is ‘sell India’ and move the money to other performing markets. Therefore, unless there is some big announcement in the Budget nudging FIIs to return to India, they will continue to sell in India thereby dragging the market downMarkets can always surprise. Some positive news/event can trigger a rally in the market.There are rumours of a sudden announcement of a US-India trade deal. If that happens close on the heels of the path breaking India-EU-trade deal, that would be a major boost to Indian economy and corporate earnings in FY27, and therefore, the market will respond positively.""On Wednesday, Wall Street delivered a subdued performance. The Nasdaq ended marginally higher, supported by gains in chip-related stocks, while the S&P 500 finished largely flat on Wednesday. Investor response remained muted after the US Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged, in line with expectations, and offered little clarity on the timing of future rate cuts.In commodities, gold continued its record-setting run on Thursday, moving closer to the $5,600 per ounce level as investors sought safe-haven assets amid ongoing geopolitical and economic uncertainties. Silver also advanced, coming close to the $120 mark.On the institutional front, foreign portfolio investors were net buyers of Indian equities worth Rs 480 crore on Thursday.

Vi charts revival plan after AGR relief,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/vi-charts-revival-plan-after-agr-relief/articleshow/127748277.cms,".

Mumbai: After years spent navigating regulatory headwinds and financial strain, Vodafone Idea is beginning to look beyond survival. “For the first time in years, the fog has cleared, allowing the business to look beyond survival and focus on sustainable growth,” said Aditya Birla Group chairman Kumar Mangalam Birla , adding that the turning point that fundamentally changed the telecom company’s operating environment was the resolution of the long-pending Adjusted Gross Revenue (AGR) issue.Vodafone Idea, created following the merger of UK-based Vodafone’s local operations and Aditya Birla Group’s Idea Cellular in 2018, had been burdened by prolonged AGR dues, customer losses, underinvestment and operational challenges, casting uncertainty over its future. The company got a breather when govt froze the AGR dues and agreed to a staggered payment of frozen amount over 10 years.“The Vodafone Idea experience underlines my belief that tough times don’t last. Tough companies do,” said Birla in his annual reflection to group stakeholders. “A dogged focus on daily operations, service and network expansion, will now serve as the foundation for revival.” Birla emphasised that a healthy and competitive telecom industry is essential for India’s digital future. “India deserves three private telecom players. India deserves a successful Vodafone Idea. And this is, once again, an idea whose time has come.”Vodafone Idea CEO Abhijit Kishore said the worst is now behind the company and unveiled a three-year plan targeting double-digit revenue growth, a higher subscriber base and a tripling of operating profit.To achieve these goals, Vodafone Idea will invest Rs 45,000 crore over the next three years, the bulk of which will go toward network expansion. Vi plans to achieve 4G parity with competitors across its 17 priority circles, which contribute over 99% of revenue, while simultaneously expanding 5G coverage in urban markets.Birla attributed its survival to the commitment of employees, the loyalty of customers and the belief of business partners and shareholders. “Equally vital was govt’s unflinching determination to revitalise the telecom sector, coupled with the firm conviction of the promoters on the long-term potential of the Indian telecom sector,” he said.","Vodafone Idea CEO Abhijit Kishore unveiled a three-year plan targeting double- digit revenue growth, a higher subscriber base and a tripling of operating profit.

Mumbai: The unabated rally in gold and silver prices continued on Wednesday with the domestic prices of both the precious metals breaking above record high levels. Gold prices in the domestic bullion markets traded around the Rs 1.7 lakh/10gm level while prices of silver hovered around the Rs 3.7 lakh/kg mark. And on the MCX, gold futures contracts for Feb delivery hit an all-time high at Rs 1.65 lakh while silver futures for March delivery hit a new life-high at Rs 3.87 lakh.The rally in the two precious metals came on the back of a rally in international prices due to the weakness of the dollar in early trades. In late trades the prices of these two metals were further boosted by the US president Donald Trump’s social media post that a large US navy fleet was on its way to West Asia, aimed at threatening Iran into the negotiation table for nuclear disarmament.In late trades, gold prices had crossed the $5,300/ounce (Oz) level while silver prices were trading at $113/Oz. Both were trading marginally below their all-time high prices.Market players said that geopolitical uncertainties and the weakness of the dollar were the main reasons for the sharp uptick in the prices of the two precious metals. For silver, increasing demand from fast-growing industries like EV, semiconductors, solar and smart grids were the added price-drivers.","The rally in the two precious metals came on the back of a rally in international prices due to the weakness of the dollar in early trades.

New Delhi: The India-EU trade pact includes two special provisions under which, if new regulations or rules are introduced in the future that could act as a trade barrier or undermine the benefits of the deal for exporters, corrective measures can be taken by the affected nation to address such impediments, an official said.The two special market access safeguarding measures are the rapid response mechanism (RRM) and non-violation complaints (NVCs) provisions, the commerce ministry official said. Under RRM, both sides have agreed to establish a dedicated and expedited mechanism to address concerns arising from existing and future measures/regulations that create or threaten to create significant disruption or impediment to trade between the two regions.“These are to take care of new regulations, new impediments which may emerge. New rules may come up, which have concerns for the trade,” an official said.

Tether is shaking up gold market with massive metal hoard,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/tether-is-shaking-up-gold-market-with-massive-metal-hoard/articleshow/127749392.cms,".

There are roughly 370,000 nuclear bunkers in Switzerland, a legacy of the Cold War that are now rarely used. One of them, though, is a hive of activity.Every week, more than a ton of gold is hauled in to the high-security vault, owned by crypto giant Tether Holdings SA, which is now the world’s largest known hoard of bullion outside of banks and nation states. Over the past year, Tether has quietly become one of the biggest players in the global gold market — the embodiment of a meeting of the crypto and gold worlds whose shared distrust of govt debt is a major factor behind the surge in prices to never-before-seen highs above $5,200 an ounce.And yet relatively little is known about its inner workings, or its gold strategy. When two of the most senior gold traders quit leading bullion bank HSBC Holdings last year, the industry was abuzz with gossip about where they would head next; few guessed that the answer was Tether.In an interview with Bloomberg, chief executive Paolo Ardoino described the company’s role in the gold market as similar to that of a central bank, and predicted that Washington’s geopolitical rivals would launch a gold-backed alternative to the dollar.He revealed that it plans to keep ploughing its enormous profits into gold, while also beginning to compete with banks in trading the metal.“We are soon becoming basically one of the biggest, let’s say, gold central banks in the world,” he said.Even in these historic times for the gold market, Tether’s activities stand out. It has rapidly stepped up its purchases, buying over 70 tonnes of gold over the course of last year for its reserves and its own gold stablecoin, according to a Bloomberg calculation. That’s more than was reported by almost any single central bank: only Poland, which added 102 tonnes to its reserves, made larger declared purchases. It is also more than what was bought by any but the three largest exchange-traded funds, which represent the collective activity of tens of thousands of individual traders and investors.Tether holds around 140 tonnes of gold, according to Ardoino, most of which are its own reserves, along with the bullion backing its own gold token. That amount of metal is worth $24 billion, the largest known hoard outside of those held by central banks, ETFs and commercial banks whose vaults underpin the main trading hubs. Ardoino said Tether had been buying at a rate of about one to two tonnes a week, and intended to continue doing so for “definitely the next few months. ”Tether makes money from its dollar stablecoin that is the giant of the sector, with $186 billion in circulation. The company takes in real dollars in exchange for that USDT token, and invests them in Treasuries and other assets, such as gold, raking in billions in interest and trading profits.Possessing the physical metal is crucial, Ardoino said, so much so that the company has taken the unusual step of storing the bullion itself in the former nuclear bunker in Switzerland, guarded by multiple layers of thick steel doors. “It’s a James Bond kind of place,” Ardoino said.The secretive nature of the gold market means that while it’s easy to describe broad drivers of investment, it can be hard to pinpoint who exactly is buying. China, for example, officially disclosed just 27 tonnes of purchases last year, but many traders believe it bought much more.Such is the scale of Tether’s disclosed purchases, that some market watchers have pointed to their role in shifting global prices. The purchases likely contributed to gold’s 65% rally last year, analysts at Jefferies Financial Group said in a note, describing Tether as a “significant new buyer” which “could drive sustained gold demand.”"," crypto giant Tether Holdings SA is now the world’s largest known hoard of bullion outside of banks and nation states.

US Dollar’s ‘Worst Day’ As Trump DUMPS Concerns Over Currency Decline | ‘Can Control It Like Yo-Yo’

What are ' Trump accounts '?

US President Donald Trump on Wednesday launched a new federal investment programme for newborns, with the White House saying over 500,000 families have already enrolled. The initiative aims to help children build long-term savings and address affordability concerns for American families.The investment accounts, named after Trump are being set up for babies born over a three-year period and include an initial government contribution. The move comes as the Trump administration and the Republican Party seek to address rising affordability concerns ahead of the November midterm elections, according to Reuters.The accounts were created last year under Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the administration’s flagship tax and spending legislation.Under the scheme, the US Treasury will deposit $1,000 into investment accounts for all children born between 2025 and 2028. Officials estimate that around 25 million families will be eligible for the benefit.The government is also encouraging families to make additional contributions to the accounts. Some private investors have already stepped in, including entrepreneur Michael Dell and his wife Susan, who have committed a combined $6.25 billion to the programme.Speaking at a White House event in Washington to launch the accounts, Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said that the initiative was designed to address gaps in savings among American families.She said if families contribute the maximum $5,000 each year, the account will accumulate almost $1.1 million by the time the newborn turns 28.The Trump administration is also promoting the programme as a bipartisan effort rather than a partisan policy.“It’s not about red or blue politics,” Cheryl Hines, an actress and the wife of Health Secretary Robert Kennedy, said at the event.Despite the rollout, public awareness of the programme remains limited. A poll by Exclusive Public First found that 57 per cent of Americans had never heard of a Trump account, while another 25 per cent said they were aware of it but could not explain how it worked, Politico reported. Only 14 per cent of respondents said they had heard of the accounts and could explain them.Trump accounts are federally supported investment accounts designed to help US children build savings from birth through long-term investing.Under the scheme, each eligible child receives a one-time government deposit of $1,000 into an account opened in their name, with parents or guardians acting as custodians until the child turns 18, according to ET.Money in the accounts is required to be invested in low-cost index funds largely tracking US companies. The funds remain locked in until adulthood, after which the account converts into an individual retirement account (IRA).Families, employers and other contributors can add up to $5,000 annually, while employer contributions of up to $2,500 are exempt from being treated as taxable income. Withdrawals are governed by standard IRA rules, with limited allowances for specific purposes such as education, buying a first home or starting a business.The administration said that the initiative brings together government support, private participation and household savings to strengthen long-term financial security for future generations.","Trump accounts are federally supported investment accounts designed to help US children build savings from birth through long-term investing.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 114 points, or 0.2 per cent, while the Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.5 per cent in early trade, AP reported.The pace of the S&P 500’s climb has accelerated sharply in recent years. It took nearly three years for the index to rise from 4,000 to 5,000, but only about nine months to move from 5,000 to 6,000, a level reached in November 2024. The swift push past 7,000 reflects mounting confidence in US corporate earnings and the economy’s ability to withstand tighter financial conditions.Gains on Wednesday were led by heavyweight technology stocks after Dutch chip equipment maker ASML issued a 2026 revenue forecast that exceeded market expectations, reinforcing confidence in sustained demand linked to artificial intelligence.ASML’s customers have become more optimistic about the medium-term outlook, driven largely by expectations for the “sustainability” of AI-related demand, chief executive Christophe Fouquet said, helping ease concerns that the AI rally could be approaching bubble territory.Nvidia, widely seen as the bellwether of the AI boom, rose 1.2 per cent, making it the single biggest contributor to the S&P 500’s advance. ASML’s US-listed shares were little changed.Elsewhere, stock moves were mixed following fresh earnings updates. Starbucks jumped 4.9 per cent after quarterly revenue beat expectations, aided in part by strong demand for a viral promotional cup, even though profits for the end of 2025 missed estimates.In contrast, Amphenol slid 14.9 per cent despite reporting stronger-than-expected profit and revenue growth, as elevated expectations weighed on the stock after a sharp rally earlier this year.Analysts said companies remain under pressure to deliver robust earnings growth following the market’s record-setting run, with stock prices increasingly vulnerable to any disappointment.In currency markets, the US dollar stabilised, rising about 0.3 per cent against the British pound and Japanese yen, a day after a broader dollar index fell to its weakest level since early 2022.The dollar has generally weakened since President Donald Trump returned to the White House last year, with losses accelerating after renewed tariff threats against parts of Europe earlier this month. Those risks, combined with concerns over US government debt, have periodically prompted global investors to reduce exposure to US assets — a trend often referred to as “Sell America.”In the bond market, Treasury yields were steady ahead of the Federal Reserve’s interest rate decision later in the day. The 10-year yield held at 4.24 per cent. The Fed is widely expected to keep rates unchanged, balancing persistent inflation against growth risks.Commodities remained firm as investors sought safe havens. Gold added another 3.5 per cent to $5,258.50 an ounce, after crossing the $5,000 mark for the first time earlier this week.Overseas markets were mixed. European indices slipped, while Asian stocks posted strong gains. South Korea’s Kospi rose 1.7 per cent to a fresh record, supported by a sharp jump in SK Hynix, while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rallied 2.6 per cent.","US stocks edged higher on Wednesday, with the S&P 500 breaching the 7,000-point mark for the first time.

Asian shares were mixed on Wednesday, tracking a muted lead from Wall Street after the S&P 500 edged to a fresh record, while the US dollar continued to weaken ahead of a key interest rate decision by the Federal Reserve.Markets are focused on the Fed’s policy announcement later in the day, with expectations that the central bank will keep its main interest rate unchanged for now.Traders are, however, looking for signals on the timing of possible rate cuts later this year.South Korean stocks outperformed the region, with the Kospi jumping 1.3 per cent to 5,152.14, a record high.

The dollar was trading at 152.75 yen, slightly higher on the day, but nearly 4 per cent weaker than last week, when it surged close to 160 yen and triggered warnings of intervention from Japanese and US officials.Elsewhere, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index climbed 2.4 per cent, while the Shanghai Composite added 0.5 per cent.Taiwan’s Taiex rose 1.1 per cent and India’s Sensex gained 0.5 per cent.The euro eased to $1.1995, though it has risen sharply against the dollar in recent sessions.

Khosla raids Elon’s ghosla: Calls on tech workers to quit Musk's Tesla and SpaceX,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/khosla-raids-elons-ghosla-nest-calls-on-tech-workers-to-quit-musks-tesla-and-spacex/articleshow/127639073.cms,"The TOI correspondent from Washington:

Elon Musk On EU Radar; X’s AI Chatbot Grok Faces Biggest Probe Over Sexual Deepfakes | Details

Among Silicon Valley elites where tech titans have largely aligned with President Donald Trump’s purportedly race-driven MAGA vision, Indian-American venture capitalist Vinod Khosla has been an outlier. Exceptional as his opposition to Trump has been, the billionaire tech savant has set off a political and cultural firestorm this week with a blunt message aimed at MAGA maverick Elon Musk ’s workforce: if you are a non-white employee at Tesla, SpaceX or X, you should quit — and come work for him instead.In a viral post on X, Khosla accused Musk of advancing a racially exclusionary version of Trump’s MAGA movement and urged employees who disagreed to walk away. “@elonmusk doesn’t want MAGA, he wants WAGA — ‘white America great again’ — as a ‘racism is great and desirable’ paradigm,” Khosla wrote, responding to Musk’s comments about white people becoming a “rapidly diminishing minority.” Khosla went on to invite “all non-whites… and all decent whites” at Musk’s companies to resign and send their LinkedIn profiles to Khosla Ventures.The extraordinary call — part political denunciation, part talent raid — crystallized Khosla’s position as one of the very few tech titans willing to openly challenge Trump’s growing alliance with Silicon Valley’s elite.While much of the industry – including companies like Google, Microsoft, and IBM, all led by Indian-Americans – has moved to accommodate, or even embrace, Trump II, Khosla has chosen defiance, framing the moment as a moral test for American capitalism.Musk responded by calling Khosla a “pompous a******” and reminding him that his partner, Shivon, is half Indian and his eldest son with her “is named in honor of the great Indian physicist Chandrasekhar.”The Musk clash did not emerge in isolation. For months, Khosla has used his social media presence to attack Trump’s leadership, values and approach to governance. In January 2026, he described the administration’s agenda as “The Undoing Project,” accusing Trump of orchestrating a “rampant, multifarious attack on American values, norms, institutions, laws, and democracy.” He has warned that fear and cynicism are being used to silence opposition and has repeatedly urged Republicans, executives and investors to speak out.Khosla’s hostility toward Trump is deeply personal as well as political. An immigrant from India and a co-founder of Sun Microsystems, he has argued that Trump’s rhetoric and policies undermine the meritocratic ideals that powered Silicon Valley’s rise. In earlier posts that resurfaced during the 2024 election cycle, Khosla said he despised Trump for his “lack of values, his pathological lying, his selfishness,” accusing him of appealing to “the least appealing parts of American society. ”That worldview now puts Khosla sharply at odds with the prevailing direction of the tech industry. A growing cohort of influential “tech bros” has signed up, explicitly or implicitly, for MAGA. Musk stands at the center of that universe, having donated heavily to Trump’s campaign and emerged as the president’s most powerful ally in Silicon Valley. Others in Trump’s orbit include PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel, investor and podcaster David Sacks, and venture capital heavyweights Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz, all of whom have praised Trump’s promises of deregulation, tax cuts and a lighter regulatory touch on artificial intelligence and crypto.Even executives who once positioned themselves as Trump skeptics have largely shifted to pragmatic cooperation. Leaders of Meta (Mark Zuckerberg), Amazon (Jeff Bezos), Apple (Tim Cook), Google (Sundar Pichai), Microsoft (Satya Nadella), and IBM (Arvind Krishna) have attended Trump events, increased political donations and pledged billions in US investments, while tech lobbying has surged to record levels. The calculation is straightforward: access, influence and regulatory relief outweigh ideological discomfort.By contrast, open opposition has become rare. Aside from Khosla, only a handful of prominent figures — including LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman and entrepreneur Mark Cuban — have maintained public distance from Trump. While dozens of top venture capitalists now lean pro-Trump, outspoken critics can be counted on one hand.The divide carries consequences for tech workers, many of whom remain politically liberal even as their employers drift right. Over 450 employees from Google, Meta, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, and OpenAI recently signed an open letter demanding their CEOs ""pick up the phone"" to stop ICE excesses. Khosla’s call for non-white employees to leave Musk’s companies is tapping into that tension, highlighting a widening gap between executive power and workforce values. As Trump settles deeper into his second term, Silicon Valley increasingly looks like a sector that has chosen alignment over resistance. Khosla, by contrast, is betting that dissent still matters — even if it leaves him standing nearly alone.",Vinod Khosla is one of the few tech titans willing to openly challenge Trump's growing alliance with Silicon Valley’s elite. The billionaire tech savant has set off a political and cultural firestorm this week with a blunt message aimed at MAGA maverick Elon Musk ’s workforce.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127639273,imgsize-610365,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

US stock markets opened on a mixed note on Tuesday as strong earnings from major companies lifted technology shares. However, a sharp sell-off in health insurance stocks pulled the Dow Jones Industrial Average lower amid concerns over future Medicare payments.At 9:30 am ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 305.69 points or 0.62 per cent, to 49,106.71.

Technology and auto stocks found support, while healthcare shares declined sharply after the Trump administration proposed a Medicare Advantage payment increase of less than 1 per cent for 2027.Health insurers came under heavy pressure, dragging the Dow lower. UnitedHealth Group and Humana lost nearly 16 per cent of their value before the opening bell, while Elevance Health fell 7.9 per cent and CVS Health dropped 13 per cent, according to AP.Investors were disappointed by the lower-than-expected rate increase, which threatens profit margins in Medicare Advantage plans that cover Americans aged 65 and above.UnitedHealth, the largest provider of Medicare Advantage plans in the US, reported fourth-quarter profit and revenue close to estimates but warned that its revenue could decline in 2026. The stock is down more than 40 per cent since April, reflecting mounting concerns over funding cuts and rising healthcare costs.In contrast, shares of General Motors jumped nearly 5 per cent after the automaker beat quarterly profit estimates and announced a share buyback programme. GM also said it expects to reduce losses from electric vehicle production in 2026 as it scales back output.American Airlines rose about 4 per cent after issuing strong guidance for 2026, despite missing fourth-quarter profit targets. The airline said it lost $325 million in revenue due to the recent government shutdown.Investors are also watching earnings from several mega-cap companies due later this week, including Meta Platforms, Microsoft and Tesla on Wednesday, followed by Apple on Thursday.Attention remains on the Federal Reserve, which is expected to keep interest rates unchanged when it announces its policy decision on Wednesday. While the Fed has been cutting rates to support growth and employment, inflation remains above its 2 per cent target, limiting room for aggressive easing.Global markets were mixed. In Europe, Germany’s DAX was flat, France’s CAC 40 rose 0.4 per cent and Britain’s FTSE 100 gained 0.5 per cent. Asian markets ended mostly higher, led by South Korea’s Kospi, which surged 2.7 per cent, while Japan’s Nikkei climbed 0.9 per cent.In commodities, gold prices were steady at around $5,084 an ounce after hitting a record above $5,100 on Monday, as investors sought safe-haven assets amid global trade tensions and inflation concerns.Silver fell nearly 4 per cent. Oil prices were largely unchanged, while the U.S. dollar weakened slightly against the yen and euro.

'Europe Will Retaliate': America's European Allies FIRE BACK At Trump Over Greenland Tariff Attack

US president Donald Trump announced on Monday that he is raising tariffs on South Korean imports of autos, lumber and pharmaceuticals to 25 per cent, accusing the ally’s legislature of failing to uphold its trade agreement with the United States.Trump added that South Korea’s legislature has not approved the trade deal he and President Lee Je Myung agreed to on July 30, 2025, and reaffirmed during his visit on October 29, 2025, questioning why it has not been ratified.""Because the Korean Legislature hasn't enacted our Historic Trade Agreement, which is their prerogative, I am hereby increasing South Korean TARIFFS on Autos, Lumber, Pharma, and all other Reciprocal TARIFFS, from 15% to 25%."" Trump said through a post on Truth Social.""Our Trade Deals are very important to America. In each of these Deals, we have acted swiftly to reduce our TARIFFS in line with the Transaction agreed to. We, of course, expect our Trading Partners to do the same,"" Trump added.South Korea has been moving to implement a deal announced with Washington in November aimed at reducing US tariffs on its exports. More recently, Seoul has been in talks with US officials to clarify its investigation into US-based e-commerce company Coupang (CPNG.N), which was launched following a major data leak, as cited by Reuters.South Korea is a key trading partner for the United States, consistently ranking among the top 10 sources of US imports. American companies and consumers import nearly $150 billion worth of goods from South Korea each year.In July, Trump announced a trade deal with South Korea’s president, but progress stalled for months amid disagreement over an investment pledge sought by the United States. The two leaders later finalized the agreement in October during Trump’s trip to Asia, including a commitment to invest $350 billion in the United States.In November, the White House and the South Korean government released a ""fact sheet"" outlining the deal, which was intended to move the agreement forward, as cited by NBC News.The agreement included reduced tariffs for both countries, capping US import duties at 15 per cent. This marked a rollback from the 25 per cent tariff rate announced earlier in 2025 on South Korea’s ""Liberation Day"" in April, a move that had unsettled markets.Trump’s latest tariff announcement follows at least three previous threats that were never carried out. These included a proposed 10 per cent tariff on Canada after Ontario ran an anti-tariff World Series ad, threatened tariffs on European countries over Greenland, and a 100 per cent tariff on Canada that was announced last week.","US president Donald Trump announced on Monday that he is raising tariffs on South Korean imports of autos, lumber and pharmaceuticals to 25 per cent.

UAE firm Al Habtoor plans legal action against Lebanon over $1.7 billion investment losses,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/uae-firm-al-habtoor-plans-legal-action-against-lebanon-over-1-7-billion-investment-losses/articleshow/127566752.cms,"Photo credit- AP

A Dubai-based conglomerate has said it will initiate legal action against Lebanese authorities, alleging losses of more than $1.7 billion following years of economic crisis, banking restrictions and political instability in Lebanon.The Al Habtoor Group said on Monday that its investments in Lebanon have suffered “severe and sustained harm” due to measures imposed by Lebanese authorities and the country’s central bank, which prevented the group from freely accessing and transferring funds deposited in local banks.The group’s businesses in Lebanon were badly hit by the country’s historic economic collapse that began in late 2019, as well as by the 14-month Israel-Hezbollah war. The World Bank has estimated the cost of reconstruction and recovery from the conflict at around $11 billion.Lebanon’s prolonged financial crisis, rooted in decades of corruption and mismanagement, has left individuals and companies unable to access their own savings trapped in the banking system.Al Habtoor Group operates several assets in Lebanon, including the Metropolitan Palace Hotel in a Beirut suburb and Habtoor Land, a large theme park east of the capital.Last year, the group had reversed earlier plans to dismantle the Metropolitan Palace Hotel.In a statement, the conglomerate said the damage to its assets and properties in Lebanon exceeds $1.7 billion, blaming not only banking restrictions but also the wider political, economic, financial and social crises, as well as the failure of the Lebanese state to provide a stable and secure investment environment.While reiterating that it remains open to “lawful and constructive solutions” that would fully restore its rights, the group said it has exhausted all good-faith efforts to resolve the dispute amicably.“As a result, the group has no other alternative but to advance this matter further and proceed to take all legal measures necessary to protect and enforce its rights under applicable international agreements and legal frameworks,” it said, without specifying where the legal action would be filed.Officials at the Lebanese prime minister’s office were not immediately available for comment.The move comes at a time when Lebanon has been seeking to repair ties with oil-rich Gulf countries after years of strained relations linked to the influence of Hezbollah. The militant group was severely weakened during its latest war with Israel, which ended with a US-brokered ceasefire in November 2024.Lebanon has since installed a new president and prime minister, both of whom have pledged to fight corruption and stabilise the country’s battered economy.","Al Habtoor Group says its investments in Lebanon have suffered “severe and sustained harm’ The Dubai-based conglomerate alleges losses of more than $1.7 billion following years of economic crisis, banking restrictions and political instability in Lebanon.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127566722,imgsize-1333492,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

Yen rebound hits Japanese exporters

Mixed performance across Asian markets

US futures dip amid tariff uncertainty

Wall Street ends week mixed

Commodities jump as investors seek safety

Asian stock markets mostly declined on Monday, led by sharp losses in Japan after the yen strengthened against the US dollar, hurting exporter stocks.Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 fell 1.8% to 52,870.15, weighed down by heavy selling in major exporters such as Toyota Motor Corp., whose shares dropped 4%.Markets across the region remained cautious amid currency volatility, uncertainty over US trade policies and ahead of a key US Federal Reserve policy decision later this week.The sell-off in Japan came after the yen staged a strong rebound against the dollar in recent days. A weaker yen typically supports Japanese exporters by boosting the value of overseas earnings, but the recent currency move reversed that advantage.The dollar slipped to 154.27 yen from 155.01 yen, after trading near 158 yen last week, reported AP.The move followed comments from Japanese and US officials signalling close coordination on currency movements, fuelling expectations of possible intervention to support the yen.“Intervention chatter did the trick.

NEW DELHI: More than 1.14 lakh startups in India have created over 12 lakh jobs so far, the finance ministry said in its latest review of the Indian economy.In the report titled, ‘The Indian Economy: A Review January 2024’, the Department of Economic Affairs said that the 1.14 lakh startups recognised by the government under the 'Startup India initiative’ created more than 12 lakh jobs (as of October 2023).The state-owned e-commerce platform Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) clocked more than 63 lakh transactions till November 2023, the document read.Despite facing global challenges in 2023 like valuation issues, few IPOs, regulatory changes and macroeconomic and geopolitical trends, India remains the third largest tech start-up ecosystem globally, with over 950 tech startups founded last year.The cumulative funding for more than 31,000 tech start ups has exceeded $70 billion (from 2019 to 2023), according to a recent report by Nasscom in collaboration with Zinnov.“In 2023, despite facing global economic and regulatory challenges, Indian tech startups have prioritised the imperative of enhancing their business fundamentals, driving profitability and growth,” said Debjani Ghosh, President, Nasscom.“The proliferation of tech startups in tier 2 and 3 cities marks the ecosystem's resilience,” she added.Navigating 2024, tech startup founders expect to continue the revenue growth path with measured steps focusing on optimising expenditure and maximising profitability for B2B tech startups.Investments in deeptech will continue an upward trend in 2024.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume.

Stay informed with the latest business news, updates on bank holidays and public holidays.





Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.","Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain.

The Series A funding round was led by Lightspeed Venture Partners, and participants included Silicon Valley billionaire Vinod Khosla’s Khosla Ventures and Peak XV Partners, formerly Sequoia Capital India & Southeast Asia, Sarvam said Thursday.The Bangalore-based startup, until recently in stealth mode, was co-founded by Vivek Raghavan and Pratyush Kumar. It has ambitious plans to build open source foundational AI systems as well as tools for creating apps for the meager compute infrastructure available to developers in India. The startup has a total of 18 employees and is just opening an office in the city.""What we are showing is that you can build large language models with limited resources,” Raghavan said in a phone interview. ""We are building at a smaller scale and demonstrating that these can be extremely cost and energy efficient so they can be accessed by everyone.""Large language models, like OpenAI’s GPT-4 and Meta Platforms Inc.’s Llama, are powerful AI systems that understand by learning from vast amounts of diverse data from the internet and elsewhere to summarize, translate, and create text, audio and video for a wide range of applications.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor (CEA) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran Udaan until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.Udaan built an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business still accounts for a very small part of India’s overall retail market but can balloon to $150 billion in sales and yield a 100% return on capital invested in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co. estimates published in the Mint newspaper.Bengaluru-based Udaan has also ventured into financing through its fintech unit which helps shopkeepers get working capital loans to buy inventory. That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says.

How India's GDP has been growing

What SBI report said on savings and investment

Incremental capital output ratio

NEW DELHI: India's gross domestic product (GDP) data for the third quarter (October-December 2022) received a word of caution from the former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan In an interview with news agency PTI, Rajan that India is ""dangerously close"" to the Hindu rate of growth in view of subdued private sector investment, high interest rates and slowing global growth.India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying"".However, a report released by the State Bank of India (SBI) economists on Tuesday dismissed arguments that India is dangerously close to Hindu rate of growth saying such statements are ""ill-conceived, biased and premature"".The term 'Hindu growth rate' was coined by late economist Raj Krishna in 1978 to describe the slow growth in the country.It basically refers to the low pace of economic growth rates during 1950s to 1980s. During this period, the Indian economy averaged 3.5%.A former lecturer at the Delhi School of Economics (DSE), Krishna noted that only if the rate of growth is persistently slow and accompanied by low per-capita GDP, then it will be known as Hindu rate of growth but it has to factor in population growth as well.Before economic reforms of 1991, India's economic growth remained stagnant and low, while per capita income averaged around 1.3%.Krishna termed this low growth situation to be a result of socialist policies of state control and import substitution.However, the economic situation changed when liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation (LPG) reforms came into effect in the year 1991, at a time when India faced balance of payment crisis.Over the years, many economists have strongly opposed the idea of 'Hindu growth rate' and the term never had universal acceptance.The Indian economy plunged into its very first technical recession in FY21 due to the impact of Covid-19 pandemic and the related nationwide lockdowns. GDP shrunk by an unprecedented 23.8% in the first quarter of the financial year 2020-21. However, due to spurt in economic activities in the subsequent quarters, the GDP decline started to narrow.However, if we look at the period before Covid-19 as well, India's growth curve shows a declining trend.From 8.26% in FY17, GDP growth plunged to 3.74% in FY20. Shutdown of economic activities in FY21 in wake of Covid-19 only made matters worse.As lockdowns started to ease and business activities resumed, India's GDP also started rising. In Q1 of FY22, growth jumped to 20.1% mainly on account of low base effect. By the fourth quarter of FY22, growth came down to 4.10%.Similarly, the new financial year 2022-23 brought fresh economic challenges in the form of Russia-Ukraine war that impacted almost all major economies of the world, slowed the pace of growth, pushed inflation to record highs.As a result, the central banks of all advanced economies spurred into action and opted for monetary policy tightening to curb the soaring inflation.With persistently rising interest rates, India's economy grew by 4.4% in Q3 of FY23, as the Centre revised upwards GDP growth for previous year to 9.10% from 8.7% earlier.The report weighed recent GDP numbers against the available data on savings and investments for the past decade and highlighted some interesting points.""Quarterly growth numbers are noisy and should be best avoided for any serious interpretation (on an average, India's GDP growth has witnessed Rs 2 lakh crore upward revision for the 3 year ended FY23),"" the report said.Gross capital formation (GCF) by the government touched a high of 11.8% in 2021-22, up from 10.7% in 2020-21.""This also had a domino effect on private sector investment that jumped from 10 per cent to 10.8% over the same period,"" it said.In fact, Ecowrap added that the trends in GCF to gross output ratio or the plough back of funds for creation of fresh capacity shows that for public administration the ratio attained fresh peak in 2021-22 owing to the emphasis on capital expenditure in recent budgets.At the aggregate level, gross capital formation is supposed to have crossed 32% in 2022-23, the highest level since 2018-19.According to the report, in 2021-22, gross savings have risen to 30% from 29% in 2020-21.""The ratio is supposed to have crossed 31 per cent in 2022-23, the highest since 2018-19. The household savings increased sharply during the pandemic period on account of sharp accretion in financial savings such as deposits,"" said the report by SBI's Economic Research Department.While household financial savings have since then moderated from 15.4% in 2020-21 to 11.1% in 2022-23, savings in physical assets have grown sharply to 11.8% in 2021-22 from 10.7% in 2020-21.The report further analysed Incremental Capital Output ratio (ICOR) -- which measures additional units of capital (investment) needed to produce additional units of output. It said that the ratio has been improving.""ICOR which was 7.5 in FY 12 is now only 3.5 in FY22. Clearly, only half of capital is now needed for next unit of output,"" the report noted.Such reducing ICOR in the current years reflects a relatively increasing efficiency of capital and shows that the economy is on a sound footing, the report said.""From that point of view, future GDP growth rates even at 7% could still mean a decent number by any standards!,"" it added.","India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.

An employee is entitled for a 50 per cent amount of the last drawn salary as pension.OPS was discontinued by the NDA government in 2003 with effect from April 1, 2004.Under the new pension scheme (NPS), employees contribute 10 per cent of their basic salary towards pension while the government contributes 14 per cent.Governments of Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand have informed the central government/ Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA about their decision to restart OPS for their employees.The government of Punjab on November 18, 2022, issued a notification regarding implementation of OPS for the state government employees who are being covered under NPS. Jharkhand too has decided to revert to OPS.",Former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan has expressed his concern over the decision of some states to restart the old pension scheme.

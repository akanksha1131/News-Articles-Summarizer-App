LPG Price Hike: Commercial cylinder becomes Rs 111 costlier — check new prices for major cities,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/lpg-price-hike-commercial-cylinder-becomes-rs-111-costlier-check-new-prices-for-major-cities/articleshow/126284216.cms,"File photo (ANI image)

Oil marketing companies have raised the prices of commercial LPG cylinders from today, reversing recent reductions. The increase is set to push up operating costs for hotels, restaurants and other service providers across the country.The price of a 19-kg commercial LPG cylinder has been hiked by Rs 111 nationwide. In Delhi, the retail price now stands at Rs 1,691.50, up from Rs 1,580.50.Mumbai saw prices rise from Rs 1,531.50 to Rs 1,642.50, while Kolkata’s rate increased from Rs 1,684 to Rs 1,795. Chennai recorded a sharp rise in prices, climbing from Rs 1,739.50 to Rs 1,849.50. Prices of 5-kg free trade LPG (FTL) cylinders were also raised by Rs 27.The increase is expected to significantly impact operating expenses for businesses that rely heavily on cooking gas, particularly in the hospitality and catering sectors, which had seen some relief last month due to successive reductions.Household consumers, however, have been spared from the latest revision. Domestic LPG cylinder prices (14.2 kg) remain unchanged, continuing at Rs 853, where they have stayed since a Rs 50 hike in April last year.The hike comes after a phase of moderation in commercial LPG prices. Since April 2025, commercial cylinder rates had seen six reductions amounting to a cumulative cut of Rs 223 per cylinder, including small rollbacks in November and December.In contrast, Aviation Turbine Fuel (ATF) prices were reduced from January 1, offering some respite to airlines after months of elevated fuel costs. In Delhi, ATF prices were cut from Rs 864.35 to Rs 791.48 per kilolitre, a move expected to ease pressure on airline operating costs, where fuel accounts for nearly 40% of total expenses, according to ET. Indian Oil Corporation , Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum revise LPG and ATF prices on the first day of every month, based on international fuel prices and currency movements.","The price of a 19-kg commercial LPG cylinder has been hiked by Rs 111 nationwide.

Bank Holidays January 2026: The new year 2026 has just begun and if your to-do list contains a bank visit, it’s a good idea to check when banks will be closed in January. A missed holiday can easily turn a routine bank visit into a wasted trip, especially in the first few days of the year when people are settling back into work and finances.Banks in India observe a mix of national and regional holidays, which means closure dates can differ from one state to another.Banks will remained closed in Mizoram, Tamil Nadu, Sikkim, Manipur, Arunachal Pradesh, West Bengal, Nagaland and Meghalaya on the occasion of New Year's Day and Gaan-Ngai.Banks will remain closed in Mizoram, Tamil Nadu in observance of New Year Celebrations and Mannam Jayanthi.Banks will remain closed in Uttar Pradesh for birthday of Hazrat Ali.Banks in West Bengal will remain closed in observance of birth day of Swami Vivekananda.Banks in Gujarat, Odisha, Assam and Arunachal Pradesh will be shut in on the occasion of Makar Sankranti and Magh Bihu.The states of Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Sikkim, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh will remain closed for Uttarayana Punyakala, Pongal, Maghe Sankranti and Makara Sankranti.Banks in Tamil Nadu will be shut in observance of Thiruvalluvar Day.Banks in Tamil Nadu will remain closed due to Uzhavar Thirunal.Banks in Tripura, Odisha, West Bengal, will remain shut in observance of the birthday of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, Saraswati Puja (Shree Panchami), Vir Surendrasai Jayanti and Basanta Panchami.Banks will remain closed nationwide on the occasion of Republic day.Apart from these, banks also remain closed on every second and fourth Saturday of the month.Knowing bank holidays in advance can help customers plan essential financial transactions and avoid last-minute delays. However, bank closure does not means that customers can not process their financial transactions during holidays. Even when branches are shut, online banking services, ATMs, mobile banking apps and UPI for fund transfers, bill payments and other routine transactions are available for customers.However, services that require a physical visit, such as large cash deposits, cheque clearances and issuing demand drafts, will not be available. To avoid inconvenience, account holders are advised to plan these activities in advance and make the most of digital banking options during closures.","Banks will remained closed in Mizoram, Tamil Nadu, Sikkim, Manipur, Arunachal Pradesh, West Bengal, Nagaland and Meghalaya on the occasion of New Year's Day and Gaan-Ngai.

Nifty is expected to remain range-bound with an upward bias, oscillating within the 25,700–26,300 corridor in the near term. The index is positioned at a technical inflection point, where a decisive move outside this band is likely to define the next directional leg.A sustained close above 26,300 would act as a bullish trigger, paving the way for a potential advance toward the 26,500 zone in subsequent sessions.On the downside, 26,000 serves as immediate support. A stronger demand zone is placed between 25,700–25,800, which coincides with the 50-day EMA, recent swing lows, and a key retracement of the prior up-move.Maintaining trade above this support cluster is essential to protect the positive momentum of the past three months and keep the broader bullish structure intact.Bank Nifty continues to outperform the Nifty, displaying clear relative strength, and is in the process of base-building within the 58,500–60,100 band over the near term.A decisive breakout with follow-through above 59,500, which also coincides with an intermediate supply zone, could trigger fresh momentum toward the lifetime high region around 60,100 in the coming sessions.The strong up-move of the past two months remains well anchored within an ascending price channel, highlighting persistent accumulation even at higher levels.On the downside, the 58,300–58,600 zone offers robust support, converging with the 50-day EMA and the earlier breakout base. As long as the index defends this support cluster, the medium-term bullish structure remains intact.The counter has established a strong uptrend, marked by a multi-month breakout and a consistent higher high–higher low formation, highlighting sustained buying interest. Prices continue to hold above major weekly moving averages, with rising volumes lending credibility to the ongoing strength.On the downside, 145 acts as immediate support, followed by 140. On the upside, resistance is placed near 170, which coincides with the 161.8% Fibonacci extension of the prior swing, and further at 175. Corrective declines toward the average should be viewed as accumulation opportunities.Momentum indicators remain robust; although the RSI above 70 indicates an overbought condition, the broader trend is intact, and any temporary consolidation is likely to be constructive rather than trend-reversing.The stock is trading above its key moving averages and has established a base formation on the weekly timeframe, indicating improving price stability. The weekly chart reflects a higher high–higher low structure, confirming a strengthening trend.Immediate support is seen at 245, followed by 240, while short term resistance is placed near 275, with further upside potential toward 292.From a momentum perspective, ADX at 28 signals a strengthening trend, while the weekly RSI at 63 suggests bullish dominance.","Nifty is expected to remain range-bound with an upward bias, oscillating within the 25,700–26,300 corridor in the near term.

MCX Gold has retreated toward its breakout zone after marking an all-time high of 140,465. With the broader trend still positive, we view this correction as a buying opportunity. As long as prices hold above the breakout support, the overall outlook for MCX Gold remains bullish.From a technical perspective, immediate support is placed around the 132,000 level, which marks the breakout from the prior swing high. Any retracement toward this area is expected to attract fresh buying interest, thereby capping near-term downside. Holding this support level keeps the bullish structure intact.On the upside, MCX Gold is poised to advance toward the 140,000 level in the upcoming sessions. This projected target is well aligned with the broader bullish trend and reflects the underlying strength of established market momentum.Furthermore, a decisive and sustained breakout above intermediate resistance level could attract additional buying interest, thereby reinforce the positive sentiment and extend the upward move further.Overall, MCX Gold is expected to maintain its positive bias unless there is a clear and decisive break below the 132,000 support level. The broader technical structure remains constructive and continues to favour trend continuation. Provided that momentum indicators and overall market sentiment continue to remain supportive, the precious metal is expected to experience further upside potential in the coming sessions.MCX Silver has recorded an all-time high, followed by a subsequent correction from those levels. Despite this pullback, prices continue to trade with a positive bias, and we expect consolidation around the recent highs. Such consolidation phases generally signal a temporary balance between buyers and sellers, and a breakout from the current formation may trigger an accelerated price move as momentum builds and the prevailing trend resumes.From a technical standpoint, a rebound from the support level signals renewed strength in the trend and raises the probability of further upside. As long as prices hold above the weekly support levels, the bullish bias is likely to remain intact. The immediate key support is identified near the 221,000 level, which now acts as a strong base. Any retracement toward this zone may attract fresh buying interest, helping to stabilize and sustain prices.On the upside, MCX Silver could potentially advance toward the 260,000 level in the near to medium term. This target reflects an extension of the previous bullish move and aligns with the prevailing market momentum. Overall, as long as prices remain above the 221,000 support, MCX Silver is expected to sustain its positive trajectory, with additional upside possible as bullish sentiment continues to gain strength.","Gold and silver prices are likely to maintain their bullish trend, says Abhilash Koikkara, Head - Forex & Commodities, Nuvama Professional Clients Group.

Oil prices inched higher on the first trading day of 2026 after logging their steepest annual decline since 2020, as fresh geopolitical risks resurfaced in global energy markets.Brent crude futures rose 14 cents to $60.99 a barrel by 0146 GMT, while US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude gained 14 cents to $57.56 a barrel.The modest uptick came amid reports of Ukrainian drone strikes targeting Russian oil facilities, alongside tighter pressure on Venezuelan exports following fresh US sanctions.Russia and Ukraine traded accusations of attacks on civilians on New Year's Day, even as intensive talks overseen by US President Donald Trump continued in a bid to end the nearly four-year-old war, Reuters reported.Kyiv has stepped up attacks on Russia’s energy infrastructure in recent months, seeking to curb Moscow’s financing of its military campaign in Ukraine.Adding to supply concerns, Washington on Wednesday imposed sanctions on four companies and associated oil tankers operating in Venezuela’s oil sector.The US blockade is aimed at preventing sanctioned tankers from entering or leaving Venezuela, forcing state-run energy firm PDVSA to adopt extreme measures to avoid shutting refining units as residual fuel inventories pile up.Despite the early gains, oil prices remain under pressure.Brent and WTI ended 2025 with losses of nearly 20%, the sharpest annual fall since 2020, as oversupply worries and tariff concerns outweighed geopolitical risks.It also marked Brent’s third consecutive year of declines—the longest losing streak on record.","Brent crude futures rose 14 cents to $60.99 a barrel by 0146 GMT, while US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude gained 14 cents.

"Credit growth outpaces deposit, sharpens wedge",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/credit-growth-outpaces-deposit-sharpens-wedge/articleshow/126296787.cms,"RBI

Bank credit expands 11.9%

MUMBAI: Deposit outflows during the first half of Dec, which was largely attributed to tax payments, widened the gap between credit offtake and deposit accretion at scheduled banks, highlighting a growing structural imbalance in the system.According to RBI data, on a year-on-year basis, deposit growth continued to lag credit expansion during the fortnight ended Dec 15 and turned negative over the previous fortnight.Deposits, excluding inter-bank balances, rose 9.4% from a year earlier to Rs 246.4 lakh crore, but fell by nearly Rs 1.7 lakh crore between Nov 28 and Dec 15. Demand deposits, despite growing 11.8% y-o-y, contracted by Rs 94,677 crore during the fortnight, while time deposits, up 9.1% annually, declined by Rs 71,782 crore.Credit growth, by contrast, remained strong. Bank credit expanded 11.9% y-o-y to Rs 201.8 lakh crore, outpacing deposit growth by about 250 basis points. Even as deposits shrank in the latest fortnight, banks extended fresh credit of Rs 1.1 lakh crore, sharply widening the credit-deposit wedge.To bridge the mismatch, banks appear to have leaned on alternative sources of liquidity. Borrowings from RBI jumped from Rs 2,144 crore to Rs 26,568 crore over the fortnight, while investments declined.Banks' investment portfolios grew only 5.1% y-o-y and fell by Rs 16,713 crore in the latest fortnight, suggesting liquidation of govt and other approved securities to fund credit demand in the absence of fresh deposits.Bankers said bank credit running ahead of deposit growth is usually self-correcting, as money lent out ultimately results in deposit growth. A new bank loan normally creates a matching deposit, thereby lifting aggregate deposits as net lending increases. Loan repayments do the reverse, shrinking deposits as bank assets and liabilities contract.However, if banks originate loans and then quickly securitise or sell them, using the proceeds to make more loans, reported credit can rise while the associated deposits sit with investors or move off balance sheets, limiting net deposit growth at the system level. Similarly, loans funded through central bank refinancing lines or wholesale market borrowing expand credit without a commensurate rise in customer deposits, as liability growth accrues to central bank or wholesale funding rather than retail deposits.","Deposits, excluding inter-bank balances, rose 9.4% from a year earlier to Rs 246.4 lakh crore.

Goyal explains 10-minute delivery model



'1 lakh workers participated in strike'



NEW DELHI: Food delivery giants Zomato , Swiggy and magicpin reported a massive surge in orders on New Year's Eve, saying operations remained largely unaffected despite a nationwide strike call by a section of gig workers demanding better pay and working conditions.Sharing a post on X, Eternal founder Deepinder Goyal said, ""Zomato and Blinkit delivered at a record pace yesterday, unaffected by calls for strikes that many of us heard over the past few days.""""Support from local law enforcement helped keep the small number of miscreants in check, enabling over 4.5 lakh delivery partners across both platforms to deliver more than 75 lakh orders (all-time high) to over 63 lakh customers during the day,"" he added.Magicpin founder and CEO Anshoo Sharma also said the platform saw ""no impact"" from the strike, adding that New Year’s Eve once again showed how central food delivery has become to celebrations in India. He noted that lakhs of orders poured in every hour across metro cities.Magicpin said pizza emerged as the early favourite, while desserts such as gajar ka halwa and ice cream saw a three-fold jump in orders compared with last year, PTI reported.Dinner orders peaked around 9.30 pm, with butter chicken topping the charts in Delhi-NCR, followed by biryani and dal makhni.Swiggy and magicpin data showed Indians feasting on biryani, pizzas, butter chicken and traditional desserts. On Swiggy alone, biryani crossed 2.19 lakh orders before 7.30 pm.""Meanwhile, the age-old battle between pizzas and burgers continued. By 8.30 pm, over 2.18 lakh pizzas had been dispatched, while burgers put up a fight with over 2.16 lakh orders, proving that India's palate is as diverse as its celebrations,"" Swiggy said.Dining out also saw strong traction. Swiggy Dineout bookings were led by Bengaluru and Hyderabad, while Ahmedabad recorded the fastest growth with a 1.6x jump, followed by Lucknow (1.3x) and Jaipur (1.2x), PT reported.Goyal thanked delivery partners who worked through the day, saying, ""delivery partners who showed up despite intimidation, stood their ground, and chose honest work and progress"".He cautioned people against being influenced by ""narratives pushed by vested interests,"" saying that a system would not continue to attract and retain large numbers of workers if it were fundamentally unfair.""The gig economy is one of India's largest organised job creation engines, and its real impact will compound over time, when delivery partners' children, supported by stable incomes and education, enter the workforce and help transform our country at scale,"" he added.In a separate post, Goyal sought to clarify concerns around quick-commerce deliveries, especially the 10-minute promise.""One more thing. Our 10-minute delivery promise is enabled by the density of stores around your homes. It's not enabled by asking delivery partners to drive fast,"" he said, adding that delivery partners do not even see a countdown timer on their apps showing the promised delivery time.He explained that after an order is placed on Blinkit, it is typically picked and packed within 2.5 minutes, after which the rider travels an average distance of under 2 km in about eight minutes, translating to an average speed of around 15 kmph.""I understand why everybody thinks why 10 minutes must be risking lives, because it is indeed hard to imagine the sheer complexity of the system design which enables quick deliveries,"" Goyal said.""If you’ve ever wanted to know why millions of Indians voluntarily take up platform work and sometimes even prefer it to regular jobs, JUST ASK any rider partner when you get your next food or grocery order. You will be humbled by how rational and honest they will be with you,"" he said.Goyal acknowledged that ""no system is perfect, and we are all for making it better than today. However, it is far from what it is being portrayed on social media by people who don’t understand how our system works and why,"" he said. ""If I were outside the system, I would also believe that gig workers are being exploited, but that’s not true,"" he added.The Gig & Platform Services Workers Union (GIPSWU), which called the December 31 strike, claimed over one lakh workers across 22 cities participated, including around 14,000 members from major metros.The union reiterated demands such as minimum per-kilometre pay, workplace safety for women, maternity and emergency leave, and legal recognition of platform workers under labour laws.However, estimates suggest India has over 12.7 million gig workers, a number that government think tank NITI Aayog expects to grow to 23.5 million by 2029–30. Meanwhile, India’s third-largest food delivery platform, magicpin, said lakhs of orders were received every hour across metro cities on New Year’s Eve.","Food delivery giants Zomato, Swiggy and magicpin reported a massive surge in orders on New Year's Eve.

This shall enhance competition and safeguard subscriber's interests,"" said PFRDA in a statement.Banks willing to sponsor these funds will have to meet a 'clearly defined' eligibility criteria based on net worth, market capitalisation and prudential soundness, aligned with RBI norms.""(It will) ensure that only well-capitalised and systemically robust banks are permitted to sponsor pension funds. Detailed guidelines will be notified separately and will apply to both new and existing pension funds,"" the statement said.Currently, banks only serve as points of presence, handling subscriber registrations, contributions and other system services. At present, there are 10 registered pension funds with the PFRDA.Besides, PFRDA also appointed three new trustees to the board of the NPS Trust following a formal selection process. The new trustees include former SBI chairman Dinesh Kumar Khara, who has also been designated as the chairperson of the NPS Trust Board.

Tax rejig sends cigarette stocks crashing up to 19%,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/tax-rejig-sends-cigarette-stocks-crashing-up-to-19/articleshow/126296652.cms,"AI-generated image

NEW DELHI: The withdrawal of GST compensation cess on cigarettes from next month will be matched by an increase in excise, and pan masala will face a health and national security cess.While govt had announced the changes earlier, the date for the tax rejig, from Feb 1, was notified late Wednesday, sending cigarette stocks crashing by up to 19% on Thursday.The finance ministry notified excise duty of Rs 2,050-8,500 for every 1,000 sticks, depending on the length of the cigarette, which will be over and above 40% GST. Govt has also put in place an elaborate system to check evasion, mandating that manufacturers of chewing tobacco, gutkha and similar products to install CCTVs covering all packing machines and preserve the footage for at least 24 months.The slide in the stocks came as analysts estimated a 15-20% hike in cigarette prices. The steep price hike could hit sales of cigarettes that in turn could hit revenue and profits of these companies, they argued.A report by leading foreign brokerage house Jefferies said that some details of the tax hikes are still awaited. ""Basis our understanding, ITC may need to take up prices by at least 15% to pass on the overall impact to consumers, if not higher,"" the report noted.The report noted that the tax hike would be ""a clear negative as volumes will be impacted and concerns would also re-emerge on risk of losing some volumes to illicit industry"".Tax consultants, however, said that there was unlikely to be an impact on prices of most cigarette brands due to the change in taxes, but companies may cite the levies as an excuse to revise some prices. ""There is some increase in the case of cigars and some cheroots,"" said a consultant with a leading firm.Govt argued that the changes were critical as it did not want sin goods to face lower taxes due to restructuring of GST.Shares of ITC, the leading player in the segment, crashed 10% in late session and closed 9.8% down at Rs 364. Godfrey Phillips India, the company that owns the licence to sell Marlboro brand in India and sells some other cigarette brands, crashed 19% in late session and closed 17.1% lower at Rs 2,290.Compared to Wednesday's numbers, at the close of trading on Thursday, the combined market capitalisation loss for these two companies was nearly Rs 56,300 crore.","The withdrawal of GST compensation cess on cigarettes from next month will be matched by an increase in excise, and pan masala will face a health and national security cess.

"Global investing outlook 2026: Why investors may look beyond the US; how AI, rate cuts and a softer dollar will shape returns",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/global-investing-outlook-2026-why-investors-may-look-beyond-the-us-how-ai-rate-cuts-and-a-softer-dollar-will-shape-returns/articleshow/126290387.cms,"Global investment opportunities are set to widen meaningfully in 2026 as easing monetary policy, a weakening US dollar and profit growth outside the United States reshape capital flows, according to Franklin Templeton report.The asset manager report titled 'Global Investment Outlook 2026 and Beyond' said that lobal markets are entering a phase where returns are likely to “broaden” across regions and asset classes, moving away from the US-centric leadership seen in recent years, even as American equities — particularly technology stocks — remain resilient.""“In 2026, we foresee broadening opportunities across global capital markets, driven by attractive profits growth outside the United States and by global monetary policy easing,” the report said.Franklin Templeton identified three cyclical forces defining the near-term landscape — broadening, steepening and weakening. Broadening reflects expanding opportunities across geographies and asset classes; steepening points to yield curves as short-term rates fall faster than long-term yields; and weakening refers to the US dollar, which the firm expects to remain under pressure.Yield curves are likely to steepen as central banks cut policy rates, reducing the appeal of cash and pushing investors towards equities, credit and longer-duration fixed income.“Falling short-term interest rates will incentivise investors to move out of cash holdings and into risk assets,” the report said, adding that cyclically sensitive sectors such as financials, industrials and smaller companies could benefit.The US Federal Reserve resumed rate cuts in September 2025 after a nine-month pause and is expected to continue easing into the first half of 2026, even as inflation remains above target. Franklin Templeton said this policy backdrop reinforces its broadening thesis, encouraging investors to look beyond traditional safe assets.The US dollar has already fallen about 10% on a trade-weighted basis this year, and the report suggested the decline may not be over. “Weakening of the US dollar tends to reinforce a broadening of returns across capital markets, by region, sector, and asset class,” it said, highlighting positive implications for emerging market debt and equities.Looking beyond 2026, Franklin Templeton outlined three long-term themes likely to shape portfolios over the coming half-decade — the Age of Intelligence, the mainstreaming of private markets and an era of big government.Artificial intelligence remains central to the long-term investment case, but the report stressed that AI deployment is still in its early stages. “Its contribution to growth, social welfare, and investment returns is just beginning,” Franklin Templeton said, pointing to continued opportunities in data centres, advanced semiconductors and AI-enabling infrastructure.A key constraint — and opportunity — lies in energy. “One of the most compelling investment themes is the need to ‘feed the beast’ to sate AI’s vast energy appetite,” the report noted, flagging rising electricity demand and spillover benefits for engineering, industrial metals and power infrastructure.Private markets are also expected to play a larger role as investors search for income and diversification in a lower-rate environment. Franklin Templeton identified commercial real estate debt, infrastructure and secondary private equity offerings as preferred areas as cash yields decline.At the same time, the report struck a note of caution, warning that rising government intervention could dampen returns. “We have entered an era of big and intrusive government, which risks lowering returns and increasing risk across capital markets over the remainder of this decade,” it said.Franklin Templeton said investors will need to adapt portfolios to a world where leadership is more dispersed, policy uncertainty remains elevated and innovation — particularly in technology, private assets and digital finance — continues to be the dominant long-term driver of returns.","Global investment opportunities are set to widen meaningfully in 2026, according to Franklin Templeton report. Easing monetary policy, a weakening US dollar and profit growth outside the United States reshape capital flows, it said.

Healthcare shock for Americans! Medical insurance subsidies expired; millions stuck with hiked premiums,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/healthcare-shock-for-americans-medical-insurance-subsidies-expired-millions-stuck-with-hiked-premiums/articleshow/126288936.cms,"Millions of Americans face higher healthcare costs as enhanced Affordable Care Act tax credits expired on January 1, 2026, despite efforts from both Republicans and Democrats to find a solution. The expiration affects over 20 million people who rely on these subsidies, with average premium costs more than doubling for most enrollees.The subsidies were part of the original Affordable Care Act passed during the Obama administration and were later enhanced during the Covid-19 pandemic to boost financial assistance for those already eligible and to expand coverage to more Americans. First introduced in 2021 as a temporary pandemic-era measure, the enhanced subsidies were extended by Democrats in power at the time, pushing their expiration to the start of 2026. The subsidies helped lower-income enrollees get free coverage and ensured higher earners paid no more than 8.5 per cent of their income for health insurance.The political battle to save these subsidies led to a 43-day government shutdown, but the two opposing parties could reach an agreement. A House vote expected in January 2026 offers another chance, though success remains uncertain.""It really bothers me that the middle class has moved from a squeeze to a full suffocation, and they continue to just pile on and leave it up to us,"" said Katelin Provost, a 37-year-old single mom whose monthly premium is jumping from $85 to nearly $750, as quoted by the Associated Press.Stan Clawson, a 49-year-old freelance filmmaker in Salt Lake City living with paralysis, saw his monthly premiums increase from $350 to nearly $500. He's choosing to absorb the cost due to his medical needs.Health experts warn that many younger, healthier Americans might drop coverage altogether due to the higher costs. The Urban Institute and Commonwealth Fund predict about 4.8 million Americans will lose coverage in 2026. This could make the program more expensive for older, sicker participants who remain.Some affected individuals are making tough choices. Provost plans to drop her own coverage while maintaining insurance for her four-year-old daughter if Congress doesn't restore the subsidies soon.Chad Bruns, a 58-year-old enrollee from Wisconsin, expressed frustration with the political gridlock: ""Both Republicans and Democrats have been saying for years, oh, we need to fix it. Then do it. They need to get to the root cause, and no political party ever does that.""The issue remains particularly important as the country enters a crucial midterm election year, with healthcare affordability ranking high among voters' concerns.","Extension of Affordable Care Act tax credits expired on January 1, 2026.

Euro switch: Bulgaria joins the euro nearly two decades after EU entry; cheers mix with fears over prices,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/euro-switch-bulgaria-joins-the-euro-nearly-two-decades-after-eu-entry-cheers-mix-with-fears-over-prices/articleshow/126286270.cms,"Bulgaria on Thursday adopted the euro as its official currency, becoming the 21st country to join the eurozone, a long-anticipated milestone that comes almost 20 years after the Balkan nation entered the European Union, but one that has exposed deep political and public divisions.At midnight, Bulgaria formally gave up the lev, which had been in use since the late 19th century, marking the transition with projections of Bulgarian euro coins on the central bank’s building in Sofia. The country of 6.4 million people joined the eurozone amid New Year celebrations that blended optimism with anxiety over inflation and political instability, AFP reported.“I warmly welcome Bulgaria to the euro family,” European Central Bank president Christine Lagarde said, describing the euro as a “powerful symbol” of “shared values and collective strength”.For some Bulgarians, the switch was tangible and immediate. “Great! It works!” said Dimitar, a 43-year-old, after withdrawing 100 euros from an ATM shortly after midnight.Successive Bulgarian governments have backed euro adoption, arguing it would strengthen ties with the West, boost the economy of the EU’s poorest member and shield the country from Russian influence. But public opinion has remained split, with many fearing that the transition could push up prices and worsen political uncertainty.President Rumen Radev, speaking shortly before midnight, hailed the move as the “final step” in Bulgaria’s EU integration, even as thousands gathered in sub-zero temperatures in Sofia to mark the New Year. He also expressed regret that Bulgarians had not been consulted through a referendum.“This refusal was one of the dramatic symptoms of the deep divide between the political class and the people, confirmed by mass demonstrations across the country,” Radev said.The euro switch comes at a turbulent political moment. Anti-corruption protests ousted a conservative-led government in mid-December, leaving Bulgaria facing the prospect of its eighth election in five years.“People are afraid that prices will rise, while salaries will remain the same,” a woman in her 40s told AFP in Sofia.At major markets in the capital, prices for goods ranging from groceries to New Year’s Eve items were displayed in both levs and euros. “The whole of Europe has managed with the euro, we’ll manage too,” said Vlad, a retired resident.European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said Bulgaria’s entry into the eurozone marked “an important milestone”, adding that it would make travel and living abroad easier, improve market transparency and competitiveness, and facilitate trade.Central bank governor Dimitar Radev said the euro represented more than “just a currency — it is a sign of belonging”.However, concerns remain widespread. According to the latest Eurobarometer survey, 49% of Bulgarians oppose the switch. Outgoing prime minister Rossen Jeliazkov sought to reassure citizens and businesses, saying he was “counting on the tolerance and understanding” of the public and insisting that inflation was not linked to euro adoption.Official data show that food prices rose 5% year-on-year in November, more than double the eurozone average. “Unfortunately, prices no longer correspond to those in levs,” pastry shop owner Turgut Ismail, 33, told AFP, saying prices had already begun to rise.Analysts warned that any disruption could be politically sensitive. “Any problems with euro adoption would be seized on by anti-EU politicians,” said Boryana Dimitrova of the Alpha Research polling institute.Some business owners complained of difficulties accessing euros ahead of the switch, while critics questioned the timing. “It’s not the right time,” said Stephane, a 64-year-old economist, citing high debt levels in other eurozone countries.The euro was first introduced in 12 countries in 2002, with Croatia the most recent entrant in 2023. Bulgaria’s accession brings the number of people using the single currency to more than 350 million.","Bulgaria formally gives up the lev, which had been in use since the late 19th century.

US offers temporary sanctions relief to Russian-controlled Serbian oil firm,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-offers-temporary-sanctions-relief-to-russian-controlled-serbian-oil-firm/articleshow/126283006.cms,"Serbia Caught In Crossfire As US Opens Energy Front Against Russia; ‘Kick Russians Out’

'Phenomenal news'

The United States has granted a majority-Russian-owned Serbian oil company a temporary reprieve from sanctions targeting Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, a Serbian minister said on Wednesday.Washington's sanctions on the Petroleum Industry of Serbia (NIS), part of its crackdown on Russia's energy sector, forced the shutdown in early December of Serbia's sole oil refinery, which supplies around 80 percent of the Balkan country's fuel needs.The measures have hit hard in Serbia, a key Kremlin ally and one of the few European countries not to have imposed sanctions on Russia over the Ukraine war.""NIS has obtained a licence from US OFAC (the Office of Foreign Assets Control) allowing it to continue operations until January 23. This means that the Pancevo refinery will be able to resume operations after 36 days,"" Serbian Energy Minister Dubravka Djedovic Handanovic said on Instagram.The reprieve will allow the Pancevo refinery, located near the capital Belgrade, to resume its activities refining crude -- a significant relief for Serbia, which has had to dip into its fossil fuel reserves to satisfy domestic demand.""We have achieved what seemed almost impossible. We will safeguard our energy security, as we have done so far,"" Handanovic added.After nine months of successive postponements, Washington on October 9 imposed sanctions on NIS, demanding the complete exit of Russian shareholders and preventing the refinery from receiving supplies.But talks over its potential sale have dragged on, with analysts warning that the refinery's closure could shrink Serbia's economic growth and threaten thousands of jobs.NIS employs some 13,500 people, and contributed more than two billion euros ($2.5 billion) in tax revenue, or nearly 12 percent of the national budget, according to the firm's annual report.Shortly before Handanovic's announcement, President Aleksandar Vucic said on social media that he believed he could soon announce some ""phenomenal political news"".""We've worked hard, we've earned it,"" Vucic added, without offering further details.NIS is 45-percent owned by Gazprom Neft, which has been targeted by US sanctions. Its parent company, Gazprom, transferred its 11.3-percent stake in NIS in September to another Russian firm, Intelligence.The Serbian state holds nearly 30 percent of NIS, with the rest owned by minority shareholders.According to the Serbian national broadcaster RTS, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban was involved in discussions between Vucic and the US State Department earlier Wednesday, while the Hungarian firm MOL is in negotiations to buy the Russian portion of NIS's shares.Meanwhile, Croatian pipeline operator Janaf, which had stopped supplying crude to the Pancevo refinery because of the sanctions, also announced it had been informed by OFAC about the reprieve.This decision ""allows us to continue implementing our agreement (with NIS) on oil transportation"" until January 23, the Croatian company stated.The two companies have a contract for crude transport valid until the end of 2026, for a total capacity of 10 million tonnes.","Serbia's sole oil refinery, which supplies 80 percent of the Balkan country's fuel needs, was shut in early December.

That marks a 479.25 percent increase from the rate of 52.02 bolivars to the dollar posted in early 2025.On the black market, where prices are determined by crypto exchange platforms, one US dollar is going for nearly 560 bolivars -- at least an 85 percent difference with the official rate.Economists say that 80 percent of Venezuela's currency exchanges are carried out on such platforms.Inflation could ultimately pass the astronomical rate of 500 percent in 2025, according to estimates from private firms.

The Nasdaq composite was little changed. Trading volumes were muted ahead of the New Year’s Day holiday, when US markets will remain closed.The S&P 500 is up more than 17% so far in 2025, buoyed by enthusiasm around artificial intelligence and its potential to lift corporate profits. Treasury yields edged higher in the bond market.Futures trading earlier in the day had pointed to a cautious open, with S&P 500 and Dow futures down 0.1% and Nasdaq futures lower by 0.2%, as most institutional investors remained on the sidelines.While artificial intelligence stocks powered much of the market’s advance this year, the rally has also attracted scepticism. Investors remain concerned about whether AI investments will deliver sufficient profits and productivity gains to justify current valuations.Stocks linked to the AI boom, including Nvidia and Broadcom, accounted for a large share of the gains in 2025, but worries persist that prices across the broader market have risen faster than underlying earnings.Adding to the caution are concerns that a US-led trade war could stoke inflationary pressures. Although the Federal Reserve cut its benchmark interest rate three times toward the end of the year, inflation continues to remain above the central bank’s 2% target.The Fed has cited signs of a weakening labour market as a reason for easing policy, with investors awaiting fresh data on weekly jobless claims later on Wednesday as an indicator of layoffs.Minutes from the Fed’s December meeting underscored divisions among policymakers, and markets are currently betting that the central bank will hold rates steady at its January meeting, AP reported.Sung Won Sohn, professor of finance and economics at Loyola Marymount University, said uncertainty continues to build across global markets.“Central banks must tread carefully, and financial markets will likely experience continued volatility as expectations shift,” he said, AP quoted.Commodity markets remained volatile as the year wound down.

'Oracle of Omaha' steps aside: Warren Buffett retires today as Berkshire CEO after 6 decades of service; Gregory Abel takes operational charge,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/oracle-steps-aside-warren-buffett-retires-today-as-berkshire-ceo-after-6-decades-of-service-gregory-abel-takes-operational-charge/articleshow/126273869.cms,"An investor who resisted labels

Insurance float as quiet genius



A succession shaped by continuity

More than a company



Warren Buffett stepped down as chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway today, bringing to an end one of the longest and most influential leadership runs in modern corporate history.The transition, announced earlier this year at Berkshire’s annual shareholders’ meeting, hands day-to-day control to vice-chairman Gregory Abel from January 1. Buffett, now 95, will remain chairman and has said he will continue coming to the office, but his withdrawal from operational leadership closes a chapter that reshaped both Berkshire and the wider landscape of American capitalism, according to ET report.What Buffett leaves behind is a company transformed beyond recognition. Once a struggling textile maker, Berkshire is today the ninth-most-valuable company in the United States, the country’s second-largest property and casualty insurer, and a sprawling conglomerate with nearly $700 billion in tradable stocks, bonds and cash, alongside ownership of roughly 200 operating businesses. Those span railroads, utilities and consumer brands, with the annual shareholder meeting in Omaha evolving into a ritual gathering for investors from around the world, ET noted.Buffett was often described as the world’s greatest investor, though he resisted easy categorisation. He began with classic value investing, buying companies trading below the accounting value of their assets, and later embraced businesses with enduring competitive advantages capable of compounding value over decades.That evolution produced some of the most successful investments of modern times, including Apple, accumulated between 2016 and 2018 and now Berkshire’s most profitable holding. His emphasis on “economic moats” shaped a portfolio anchored by global franchises across banking, consumer goods and financial services.Yet Buffett’s most consequential insight lay not only in what he bought, but in how he paid for it.The acquisition of National Indemnity in 1967, followed by GEICO and a major reinsurance operation, gave Berkshire access to insurance float — premiums collected before claims are paid. That pool of capital became the engine behind Berkshire’s growth, financing landmark deals such as the acquisition of BNSF and the company’s large stake in Occidental Petroleum, ET reported.This structure allowed Berkshire to deploy vast sums patiently, without dependence on short-term market funding, reinforcing Buffett’s reputation for disciplined capital allocation.The move to Gregory Abel marks a shift in style rather than a break in philosophy. Abel, who rose through Berkshire’s energy and utilities businesses, inherits a decentralised organisation built on trust and autonomy. Buffett’s hands-off approach — avoiding forced synergies and central control — now stands as a defining legacy Abel must steward.The transition comes amid mixed performance across some operating businesses and renewed scrutiny of Berkshire’s unusually large cash holdings. How that capital is deployed in the years ahead will be closely watched, but the company enters the handover with financial strength few peers can match.Buffett leaves behind more than a balance sheet. He leaves a way of thinking about business — patient, long-term and grounded in common sense. He spoke often about enjoying the work itself, once remarking, “I have a lot of fun doing what I do every day.”He was equally candid about wealth and responsibility, urging restraint and purpose rather than excess. Last month, he accelerated the transfer of Berkshire shares to foundations run by his three children, amounting to about $1.3 billion. In his Thanksgiving letter, he reminded readers that “kindness is costless but also priceless,” ET reported.As Berkshire enters this historic handover, much remains unchanged: the offices, routines and culture endure. What departs is the singular presence that held them together, and the assurance that came with it.","Buffett hands day-to-day control to vice-chairman Gregory Abel from January 1.

Regional markets benefited from a combination of easing monetary conditions and a powerful rally in technology shares.In China, fresh official data showed factory activity edged up marginally in December, offering a rare positive signal at the close of an otherwise subdued year for the world’s second-largest economy.A key driver of the year’s global market strength has been the US Federal Reserve’s shift towards monetary easing in the latter half of 2025, alongside a flood of investment into AI-related technologies.Minutes from the Fed’s December policy meeting revealed that most officials consider further interest rate cuts appropriate, provided inflation continues to cool as anticipated.Precious metals have been among the most volatile assets in recent days, lifted by their demand as safe-haven investments amid ongoing geopolitical tensions. Gold and silver both touched record highs last week before pulling back.","Asian markets slipped mostly into red on Wednesday, the final trading session of 2025.

Croatia was the last to join in January 2023.Bulgaria's accession will bring the number of Europeans using the euro to more than 350 million.","Bulgaria will become the 21st eurozone member on Wednesday night.

"With the legendary Warren Buffett stepping back, Berkshire Hathaway enters a new era",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/with-the-legendary-warren-buffett-stepping-back-berkshire-hathaway-enters-a-new-era/articleshow/126255534.cms,"Greg Abel faces the challenge of taking over Berkshire Hathaway from the legendary Warren Buffett this week.Many regard Buffett as the world's greatest investor after he grew Berkshire from a struggling New England textile mill that he starting buying up for $7.60 a share in 1962, to the massive conglomerate it is today with shares that go for more than $750,000 a pop. Buffett's personal fortune of Berkshire stock is worth roughly $150 billion even after giving more than $60 billion away over the past 20 years.Berkshire for decades has routinely outpaced the S&P 500 as Buffett bought up insurance companies like Geico and National Indemnity, manufacturers like Iscar Metalworking, retail brands like Dairy Queen, major utilities and even one of the nation's biggest railroads, BNSF. Along the way, Buffett bought and sold hundreds of billions of dollars of stocks and profited handsomely from his famously long-term bets on companies like American Express, Coca-Cola and Apple.Berkshire has struggled to keep that pace in recent years because it has grown so huge and also struggled to find new and significant acquisitions. Even this fall's $9.7 billion acquisition of OxyChem probably isn't big enough to make a difference in Berkshire's profits.Investors will be watching closely to see what changes Abel might make in Berkshire's trajectory, but don't expect any seismic shifts.Buffett isn't going anywhere and Abel has already been managing all of Berkshire's noninsurance businesses since 2018. Buffett will remain chairman and plans to continue coming into the office each day to help spot new investments and offer Abel any advice he asks for.Some changes are likely CFRA Research analyst Cathy Seifert said it is natural for Abel to make some changes in the way Berkshire is run. Taking a more traditional approach to leadership with nearly 400,000 employees spread across dozens of subsidiaries makes a lot of sense, she said.But Berkshire operates under an extremely decentralized structure that trusts its executives with significant decisions. Everyone associated with the company has said there are no plans to change that.The world learned that Abel was to become the designated successor at Berkshire in 2021 when Buffett's longtime business partner, the late Charlie Munger, assured shareholders at an annual meeting that Abel would maintain the company's culture.Part of Buffett's sales pitch to company founders and CEOs thinking of selling their companies has always been that Berkshire would largely allow them to continue running their companies the same way as long as they delivered results.""I think the investment community would likely applaud Greg's management style to the degree that it sort of buttons things up,"" Seifert said. ""And if it helps performance, that can't really be faulted.""Abel plays an active role managing companies Abel has already shown himself to be a more hands-on manager than Buffett, but he still follows the Berkshire model of autonomy for acquired companies. Abel asks tough questions of company leaders and holds them accountable for their performance.Abel did announce some leadership changes earlier this month after investment manager and Geico CEO Todd Combs departed, and Chief Financial Officer Marc Hamburg announced his retirement. Abel also said he's appointing NetJets CEO Adam Johnson as manager of all of Berkshire's consumer, service and retail businesses. That essentially creates a third division of the company and takes some work off of Abel's plate. He will continue to manage the manufacturing, utility and railroad businesses.Abel will eventually face more pressure to start paying a dividend. From the beginning, Berkshire has held the position that it is better to reinvest profits rather than making quarterly or annual payouts to shareholders.But if Abel can't find a productive use of the $382 billion cash that Berkshire is sitting on, there may be a push from investors to start paying dividends or to adopt a traditional stock buyback program that would boost the value of shares they hold. Currently, Berkshire only repurchases shares when Buffett thinks they are a bargain, and he hasn't done that since early 2024.Still, Abel will be insulated from such pressure for some time since Buffett controls nearly 30% of the voting power in the stock. That will diminish gradually after his death as his children distribute his shares to charity as agreed.Berkshire has a solid foundation Many of Berkshire's subsidiaries tend to follow the economy and profit handsomely whenever the country is prosperous. Berkshire's utilities typically generate a reliable profit, and its insurance companies like Geico and General Reinsurance supply more than $175 billion worth of premiums that can be invested until claims come due.Investor Chris Ballard, who is managing director at Check Capital, said most of Berkshire's businesses ""can almost take care of themselves."" He sees a bright future for Berkshire under Abel.One of the biggest questions right now may be how much additional change there will be in company leadership after Combs' departure, if any at all. The head of the insurance unit, Vice Chairman Ajit Jain, who Buffett has long lavished with praise, is now 74 and many of the CEOs of the various companies have continued working long after retirement age because they like working for Buffett.""As a long-term shareholder, we aren't too concerned with Todd's departure and don't think this is the tip of some sort of iceberg,"" said Ballard, whose firm counts Berkshire as its largest holding. ""Todd's situation is unique. It's just a reminder that Warren's pending departure is imminent and they're preparing for a new phase - one that we're still excited to see unfold.""",Greg Abel will take over Berkshire Hathaway from Warren Buffett this week. Abel has already been managing all of Berkshire's noninsurance businesses since 2018. Buffett will remain chairman and plans to continue coming into the office each day to help spot new investments.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126255617,imgsize-737246,width-400,resizemode-4/warren-buffett.jpg"

But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Space sector start-up Sisir Radar to develop SAR on L/P band SAR,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/space-sector-start-up-sisir-radar-to-develop-sar-on-l/p-band-sar/articleshow/104558111.cms,"CHENNAI: Space sector startup, Sisir Radar Private Ltd has hit success at the prestigious iDEX DefSpace Challenge with its projects for development of “L/P band Continuous Wave SAR (synthetic aperture radar) payload for LEO Small Satellites” and “Unfurlable, Electronically Steering Antenna for L/P band SAR payload” for Indian Air Force (IAF), said a top company official.The company is promoted by former Director at the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) Tapan Misra and the brains behind the Indian space agency’s RISAT series of SAR satellites as well as the Dual Frequency SAR on the Chandrayaan 2 orbiter that is currently circling the moon.""A grant of Rs 3 crore is also there for development of the products,"" Misra told IANS.Synthetic Aperture Radar or SAR is a special kind of imaging radar technology that can provide extremely accurate high resolution imagery of the terrain through clouds, smoke and dust even in pitch dark conditions. SAR imagery provides much higher resolution than other forms of remote sensing technology such as hyperspectral and multispectral. SAR is a critical technology for strategic reconnaissance and planning as well as for disaster management.According to Misra, winning the challenge in just over a year of floating the company is a major booster.He said L and P band SAR have an advantage over other frequencies (like X band) when it comes to penetration capabilities through rain, clouds, foliage and vegetation in a tropical country like India, and underground penetration capabilities in dry terrain.Continuing further, he said the L band SAR will provide 1 metre resolution, spotlight resolution in Stripmap mode. The current industry standard is 5-10 metre in L band. Misra said both the L and P band will operate simultaneously from a satellite borne SAR. Recently, Sisir Radar successfully developed and tested the world’s highest resolution L-Band SAR fitted on a drone. With 0.2 metre resolution, this is by far the highest L band SAR in the world, he said.","Space sector startup, Sisir Radar Private Ltd has hit success at the prestigious iDEX DefSpace Challenge.

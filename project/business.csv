Gold price prediction today: Gold rates continue to hover in a range as news on Donald Trump’s trade policies flows in. Where are gold prices headed and what should investors do?Gold futures remain under pressure as the MCX Gold October Futures contract struggles to recover from recent declines. After a brief pullback from the intraday lows, prices are currently hovering around ₹98,778, with key technical indicators pointing to a weak rebound lacking bullish momentum. In light of the current setup, traders are advised to adopt a Sell on Rise strategy near ₹99,000, with a stop-loss at ₹99,450.The 8-period EMA is at ₹98,765, and the 21-period EMA is at ₹98,800. Price is trying to reclaim these levels but is struggling to close decisively above either, indicating hesitation and overhead resistance. A failure to sustain above ₹99,000 would confirm bearish control.A clear lower-high lower-low formation dominates the 15-minute chart. The attempt to bounce back from the ₹98,600–₹98,700 zone is facing headwinds from the declining short-term moving averages. Selling interest is visible on every upward tick.Despite a modest bounce, volume remains uneven and not supportive of a bullish reversal. Open interest trends also suggest caution, with no aggressive long buildup detected.This favors the view of a corrective pullback rather than a trend change.The previous day’s pivot and price action suggest that the ₹99,000–₹99,200 range remains a critical resistance zone. The multiple failed attempts to hold above this level make it an ideal sell zone for intraday setups.• The RSI is approaching the 50–52 zone but has not broken above convincingly, implying weak upside momentum.• While the MACD is not visible in the chart, the price structure suggests a shallow or weak crossover at best, lacking strength to confirm bullish continuation.Given the confluence of resistance around ₹99,000, lack of follow-through volume, and weak momentum, traders may consider a Sell on Rise strategy in the range of ₹99,000–₹99,100, maintaining a stop-loss at ₹99,450. Downside targets include ₹98,550, followed by ₹98,200 if selling intensifies. Until the price decisively breaks and sustains above the 21 EMA with supportive volume, the trend remains vulnerable to further declines.","Gold futures remain under pressure as the MCX Gold October Futures contract struggles to recover from recent declines.

Stock market recommendations:Benchmark indices remain highly volatile amid escalating trade tensions between India and the United States. The heightened uncertainty is primarily driven by ongoing developments surrounding potential tariff measures. In a recent statement, US President Donald Trump suggested the imposition of a 25% tariff on Indian exports, a move that has raised concerns across markets.This proposed tariff hike has triggered anxiety among investors, who fear the repercussions it could have on bilateral trade relations and the broader economic outlook. As a result, key stock indices are experiencing sharp fluctuations, reflecting the market's sensitivity to geopolitical and trade-related developments. Market participants are closely monitoring official responses and further policy announcements from both nations to gauge the potential impact on corporate earnings and economic growth.Going ahead, index to consolidate in the range of 24,500-25,000 in the coming sessions.While a move above 25,000 levels will open further upside towards the key resistance area of 25,250, being the almost identical high of the last 2 weeks.Volatility is anticipated to remain elevated in the coming session, driven by key macro triggers including the US- India tariff decision and the RBI rate decision.On the downside, the 24,600–24,400 zone emerges as a critical demand area, marking a confluence of key technical levels — the prior swing low, the 100-day exponential moving average, and the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement of the recent up move from 23,935 to 25,669.Bank Nifty on Thursday session rebounded from the key support area of 55,500-55,000 levels being the confluence of the 100-day EMA and key Fibonacci retracement levels of the prior up moveSince April, intermediate corrections have remained shallow while the index has consistently held above its 100-day EMA.Structurally, the index is undergoing a time-wise correction rather than a steep price correction, which is a constructive sign in the context of a prevailing uptrend. The formation of higher base patterns near the key moving average support zone, along with subdued retracements, implies that stronger hands are utilizing dips to accumulate.Going ahead we expect the index to hold above the support area of 55,500-55,000 levels and head higher towards 57,500 and 58,300 levels in the coming weeks.Buy in the range of Rs 1050-1070The stock after the recent corrective decline is forming base around the 61.8% retracement of the previous up move (933-1238). The stock provides favorable risk reward set up for the next leg of the up moveThe stock has already taken 14 weeks to retrace just 61.8% of its preceding 13 weeks up move (933-1238). A shallow retracement signals a positive price structure. The weekly stochastic has approached an extreme oversold territory with a reading of 08, hence a technical pullback is likely in the coming weeks.We expect the stock to head higher towards 1175 levels being the 61.8% retracement of the 1247-1055.The stock has generated a breakout above a falling channel containing last one month’s corrective decline with a bullish gap up action signaling resumption of up move.The stock is currently trading above its short- and long-term moving averages thus validating positive bias from a medium-term perspective.We expect stocks to maintain positive bias and head towards an all time high of 3963 in the coming months, being the measuring implication of the range consolidation.","According to Bajaj Broking Research, Axis Bank, and Larsen and Toubro are the top stock picks for today. Bank Nifty on Thursday session rebounded from the key support area of 55,500-55,000 levels.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123033099,imgsize-99114,width-400,resizemode-4/123033099.jpg"

New Delhi: Goods and services tax (GST) collections rose 7.5% to Rs 1,95,735 crore in July, showing signs of a pick-up from the previous month, although the growth was slower than a year ago.According to the latest official numbers, collections from domestic sources in July, based on transactions in June, were 6.7% higher at a little over Rs 1.4 lakh crore. Those from imports were better, rising 9.7% to Rs 52,712 crore. In recent months, the domestic source has been weak, which is also visible in the muted expansion of factory output and a sharp moderation in direct tax collections.On the positive side, refunds soared 67% to Rs 27,147 crore, ensuring adequate liquidity for businesses. As a result, net collections grew 1.7% to Rs 1,68,588 crore. In recent months, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman has also nudged tax department officials, both direct and indirect, to ensure that refunds are processed quickly.J&K, Chandigarh, Odisha, Jharkhand, Mizoram, Manipur and Goa witnessed contraction in collections, while some of the large jurisdictions, such as Delhi (2%) Gujarat (3%), Maharashtra (6%), UP and Karnataka (7% each) saw muted growth.The numbers also resulted in calls for a review of GST. ""Further 117% rise in domestic refunds, most of which may be inverted duty structure refunds, show that GST rate rationalisation should be done sooner rather than later.While govt has removed inverted duty structure on many goods previously, still certain new-age goods suffer inverted duty structure. For example, lithium-ion batteries are liable to 18% GST but parts of lithium-ion batteries may still be 28%. This would lead to an inverted duty structure and consequent higher refunds leading to inefficiency in the GST system,"" said Vivek Jalan, partner at Tax Connect Advisory, a consulting firm.Besides, there were suggestions to look at ways to step up revenue. ""After a tepid growth in the previous month as well, the GST council may like to discuss the possible measures to augment revenues in the next meeting.

""We are engaged with American officials and securing our national interest is our primary objective. Govt is not going to come under pressure on areas that concern farmers and small businesses,"" said an official.While there is bound to be some impact on India's exports, sources said that it may shave off around 0.2 percentage points from GDP this year and there may not be a significant impact over the economy.The assessment is based on calculations that a significant part of India's exports to US - $20-25 billion out of overall exports of $86.5 billion last fiscal - was outside the ambit of tariffs notified through US President Donald Trump's executive order, issued early Friday (India time).In 2024-25, pharma exports were a little under $10 billion, while oil products added up to $4.2 billion and electronics were estimated at over $13 billion, made up largely of smartphones, according to official data.Apart from medicines, the exemptions include Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients, electronics and ICT products such as semiconductors, smartphones and computers and energy products.The US tariffs will now be effective Aug 7 and the penalty for Russian arms and defence purchases was not part of the executive order issued by Trump, indicating he is seeking to use it as a threat to extract a deal to his liking from India. It also said that Indian shipments that are in transit before Aug 7 - and arrive at US ports before Oct 5 - will not face the additional tariff, providing some relief to exporters.Exporters are seeking sops from govt to tide over possible loss of orders, especially in sectors such as textiles, footwear and chemicals.

Due to the Section 232 exemption of the US, only exports worth about $40 billion would be impacted with these tariffs,"" they added.Several sectors would face a 25% duty impact, including electrical and mechanical machinery (approximately $9 billion), gems and jewellery ($12 billion), shrimp ($2.24 billion), textiles/clothing ($10.3 billion), leather and footwear ($1.18 billion), animal products ($2 billion), chemicals (2.34 billion).""More than half of India's exports to the US will not be impacted by the duty. Due to the Section 232 exemption of the US, only exports worth about $48 billion would be impacted with these tariffs,"" they said, adding that the remaining exports will have a little impact on a country with a GDP of about $4 trillion and a consumer base of 140 crore.Officials highlighted concerns regarding the US dairy sector's use of animal feed, noting that India has consistently refrained from offering duty concessions in this sector across all its trade agreements.""There are religious sentiments in the dairy sector. So, it is not acceptable. There will be no compromise on these segments in any of India's trade pacts,"" they said, according to the report.Also Read | Donald Trump tariff impact?

But on Thursday, Trump took aim at all indirect American imports, which he blames for part of the $1.2 trillion US trade deficit. Trump imposed 40% tariffs on so-called transshipments, which will take effect in a week. And a senior administration official who briefed reporters said work was under way that could broaden considerably the definition of indirect shipments.The new rules cover indirect shipments from anywhere, not just China. But China, with its massive factory infrastructure and expansive manufacturing ambition, has been the main country to develop a global network for such shipments. Trade experts were quick to predict that China would be the most affected - and the most annoyed.Trump's executive order Thursday created a new category of imports: goods that are transshipped through other countries instead of coming straight from the country of origin.The 40% tariffs on these goods will be on top of whatever tariffs would have applied if the goods had come directly from the country where they were originally made.The legal definition of transshipment is narrow: a good that did not undergo a ""substantial transformation"" in the country through which it was indirectly shipped. Countries in Southeast Asia have long denied that they allow a lot of transshipment. They contend that their soaring imports of Chinese components are being assembled into new and different products that can appropriately be labelled made in their countries, and not labelled ""made in China.

"India in, China out: Majority of iPhones sold in the US from India, says Apple CEO Cook",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/india-in-china-out-majority-of-iphones-sold-in-the-us-from-india-says-apple-ceo-cook/articleshow/123047653.cms,"NEW DELHI: Despite US President Donald Trump’s regular rants about Apple’s manufacturing in India, company CEO Tim Cook on Thursday confirmed what is generally now more or less known – the “majority” of iPhones sold in the US in the past quarter were Made in India. China – the erstwhile production giant – is only playing a second fiddle and is used more to service non-US markets.Cook, speaking to analysts post the company’s quarterly results, said India has been the mainstay when it comes to producing iPhones for the US, while Vietnam is the location for making other products for America such as MacBook, iPad, and Watch.“In terms of the country of origin, it's the same as I referenced last quarter. There hasn't been a change to that, which is the vast majority of the iPhone sold in the US or the majority, I should say, have a country of origin of India,” the Apple CEO said when asked about China versus India production plans.On China, Cook had this to say, “… the products for other international countries, the vast majority of them are coming from China.”While the Trump administration imposed 25% tariffs on India earlier this week, smartphones, computers and other electronics devices are exempted from the reciprocal tariffs for now.Trump, however, has been pushing Apple and Cook not to make the iPhones in India for meeting the needs of the US consumers. “I had a little problem with Tim Cook… I said to him, my friend, I am treating you very good… but now I hear you are building all over India. I don’t want you building in India,” he had said during his visit to Doha in May.Cook’s clear stance on India manufacturing, however, is being seen as a signal that the American electronics giant stays bullish on India, especially as the country is also consistent in showing strong growth when it comes to local sales.Cook said that revenues in India are witnessing record growth, led by the growth in sales of iPhones. India is among the high growth markets for Apple which recorded 10% growth globally in its quarterly revenues which closed the quarter at $94 billion.“We saw an acceleration of growth around the world in the vast majority of markets we track, including greater China and many emerging markets, and we had June quarter revenue records in more than two dozen countries and regions, including the US, Canada, Latin America, Western Europe, the Middle East, India, and South Asia. These results were driven by double-digit growth across iPhone, Mac, and services.”The Apple CEO also said the company is in the process of expanding its retail presence in India by opening more stores.On sales, India was again amongst the high-growth countries. “We saw iPhone growth in every geographic segment and double-digit growth in emerging markets including India, the Middle East, South Asia, and Brazil.”And commenting on the global impact of US tariffs across regions (but without identifying any particular country), Cook said the “situation around tariffs is evolving.”“… so let me provide some colour there. For the June quarter, we incurred approximately $800 million of tariff-related costs. For the September quarter, assuming the current global tariff rates, policies, and applications do not change for the balance of the quarter, and no new tariffs are added, we estimate the impact to add about $1.1 billion to our costs. This estimate should not be used to make projections for future quarters, as there are many factors that could change, including tariff rates. ”","Apple CEO Tim Cook confirmed that the “majority” of iPhones sold in the US in the past quarter were Made in India.

The underwhelming numbers came despite Amazon investing $31.4 billion in capital expenditure — outpacing peers — and forecasting full-year spending of $118 billion.As of 11:13 am ET, Amazon shares were trading at $215.95, down 7.76%.“The spotlight was firmly on AWS and it didn’t quite shine as brightly as expected,” said Matt Britzman, senior equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, quoted Reuters. “While Microsoft and Alphabet have already shown strong momentum in cloud growth, AWS wasn’t the knockout many wanted to see.”The market reaction was swift, with Amazon’s stock falling to $216.60 in early trading, wiping out nearly $170 billion in market value.The tech giant's forward price-to-earnings ratio stood at 33.87, slightly behind Microsoft’s 34.19 but well above Alphabet’s 18.64, according to LSEG data.AWS, long seen as Amazon’s profit engine, accounted for about 60% of its operating income but saw its margins shrink to 32.9% — the lowest since Q4 2023. The company’s forecast for total operating income in the current quarter also fell short of market expectations.CEO Andy Jassy said during the earnings call that Amazon was still in the “very early days” of the AI race and that its scale would provide advantages once existing capacity constraints ease.At least 30 analysts raised their price targets for Amazon, while three lowered theirs, giving the stock a median target of $260.Even as AWS drew scrutiny, Amazon’s retail business remained a bright spot. The company reported an 11% jump in online store sales in Q2, beating estimates and showing resilience despite Trump-era tariffs. CEO Jassy said Amazon had not seen a notable rise in consumer prices or demand erosion so far this year.“If Amazon’s retail business was a standalone entity, it would be trading dramatically higher following the near-perfect results,” said Michael Morton, analyst at MoffettNathanson. “Unfortunately, as we all know, the success of the retail business is not what’s going to matter in the near term for Amazon’s stock price.”","Amazon Web Services (AWS) revenue rose 17.5% in the June quarter, narrowly beating Wall Street estimates, but trailing far behind Microsoft Azure’s 39% growth.

From clothing to coffee: Trump escalates tariff war,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/from-clothing-to-coffee-trump-escalates-tariff-war-whats-going-to-get-more-expensive-for-americans/articleshow/123046199.cms,"Clothes, cars and coffee to cost more



The US has slapped tariffs of up to 50% on imports from countries like China, Vietnam and Brazil, directly affecting items like apparel, coffee and vehicles.

BBC reported that clothing prices are expected to surge by up to 37%, according to Yale’s Budget Lab. Department stores such as Walmart and Target have already warned of incoming price hikes.

Coffee from Brazil now carries a 50% tariff, and Vietnamese beans face 20%, meaning daily staples could soon weigh heavier on American wallets.

While tariffs on EU and Japanese cars have been reduced to 15%, imports from the UK still face 10% levies. US-made cars relying on foreign parts are also seeing higher costs, complicating Trump’s aim to boost domestic auto production.

Canada hit hard: food, appliances and retaliation



Tariffs on Canadian exports have risen from 25% to 35%, with Canada retaliating on a wide range of US goods, including ketchup, washing machines and peanut butter, as per BBC.

Canadian grocers like Loblaw have begun labelling about 7,500 items with a “T” to indicate price hikes due to US tariffs.

Canned soups, which rely on US aluminium and steel for packaging, have seen an 8% price increase, while fruit juice prices are up 7.5%.

New and used cars in Canada have also seen price jumps of over 5%, BBC reported, as cross-border auto supply chains are hit with multiple tariffs.

Homes, beer and fuel: A ripple effect



Trump’s levies on steel, aluminium and copper are expected to increase home-building costs. The National Association of Home Builders warned: “Consumers end up paying for the tariffs in the form of higher home prices.”

Trump has floated further tariffs on lumber, impacting US housing even more. Canada supplies 69% of US lumber and is now subject to 35% duties.

Beer prices may rise due to tariffs on Mexican aluminium, affecting canned beer like Modelo and Corona. According to the Beer Institute, 64.1% of beer in the US is canned.

While European energy imports are rising under the new US-EU trade deal, Canada faces a 10% tariff on oil exports to the US. Since Canadian crude powers many US refineries, any disruption could raise fuel prices.

Canada reacts



Loopholes, uncertainty and legal challenges



President Donald Trump has pushed ahead with a sweeping set of new tariffs on imports from dozens of countries, including Canada, China and the European Union, as part of what he calls a mission to “make America GREAT & RICH Again. ” While some nations have negotiated lower rates, others are now bracing for significant increases on key exports. Consumers, meanwhile, are already beginning to feel the effects in their grocery bills, wardrobes, and housing costs.Trump insists the tariffs will bring “billions in revenue” and incentivise domestic manufacturing. But as BBC reports, critics warn that the fallout could spark inflation, worsen trade tensions, and raise prices across several sectors.Canada has sharply criticised President Trump’s decision to raise tariffs on Canadian exports not covered by the Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement (CUSMA) to 35%, calling the move unjustified and harmful to vital sectors of its economy. In a statement, the Canadian government said it remained committed to CUSMA but warned that industries such as lumber, steel, aluminium and automobiles were now “heavily impacted by US duties and tariffs.Ottawa also rejected Washington’s justification linking the tariff hike to the cross-border flow of fentanyl, noting that Canada accounts for just 1% of US fentanyl imports and has significantly stepped up border security. “We will act to protect Canadian jobs, invest in our industrial competitiveness, buy Canadian, and diversify our export markets,” the statement added.According to CNN, Trump’s tariffs will apply from 7 August, but goods already in transit will be exempt if they arrive by 5 October. This loophole, however, is unlikely to ease much pressure due to fixed shipping schedules.Trump has called the tariff process “very well, very smooth,” though negotiations remain incomplete with many nations.Legal challenges are mounting. A US appeals court recently heard arguments questioning whether Trump exceeded his authority by declaring a trade “emergency” to bypass Congress.“The only things we’ll know for sure... are that growth-sapping US import taxes will be historically high and complex,” Scott Lincicome of the Cato Institute told news agency AP.","The US has slapped tariffs of up to 50% on imports from countries like China, Vietnam and Brazil, directly affecting items like apparel, coffee and vehicles.

However, both US oil giants still managed to beat Wall Street’s earnings expectations, driven by higher production volumes.Texas-based Exxon Mobil posted a net profit of $7.08 billion, or $1.64 per share, for the quarter ended June 30, down from $9.24 billion, or $2.14 per share, in the same period last year. Revenue dropped to $81.51 billion from $93.06 billion, missing analyst projections of $82.82 billion, according to Zacks Investment Research, AP reporyted.Exxon does not adjust its earnings for one-time items, such as asset sales. Still, its reported profit exceeded analysts’ average forecast of $1.49 per share.“We achieved our highest second-quarter Upstream production since the merger of Exxon and Mobil more than 25 years ago,” said Darren Woods, Chairman and CEO of Exxon Mobil. The company reported second-quarter net production of 4.6 million oil-equivalent barrels per day, up by 79,000 barrels compared to the first quarter.Chevron Corp, meanwhile, posted a net income of $2.49 billion, or $1.45 per share. Excluding special items, adjusted earnings came in at $1.77 per share, beating analysts’ estimates of $1.70. Revenue for the quarter stood at $44.82 billion, lower than expectations.The earnings decline marks a significant reversal from the boom period of 2022, when oil and gas companies posted record profits due to high energy prices following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Since then, prices have eased. U.S. benchmark crude has largely traded below $70 per barrel this year and briefly dropped under $60 in May.Chevron said production in the Permian Basin reached 1 million barrels of oil equivalent per day during the quarter. Total US net oil-equivalent production rose by 123,000 barrels per day from the year-ago period.Chevron is also in the process of acquiring Hess Corporation for $53 billion, after securing a crucial legal clearance from a Paris court in July.The global oil market faces fresh uncertainties after eight OPEC+ members announced they would increase output by 548,000 barrels per day in August. The group cited improving global economic conditions and depleted inventories for the decision, which is expected to further pressure crude prices.While oil briefly surged in June during a 12-day conflict between Israel and Iran, it quickly dropped after the US brokered a truce and launched targeted strikes on Iran’s nuclear infrastructure.The combination of geopolitical volatility and OPEC+ actions suggests energy markets could remain under pressure in the near term, despite stronger output by US producers.","Exxon Mobil posted a net profit of $7.08 billion, or $1.64 per share, for the quarter ended June 30.

US President Donald Trump on Friday called on the Federal Reserve’s board of governors to wrest control of monetary policy from Chair Jerome Powell, escalating his public campaign for deep interest rate cuts and directly attacking Powell as “stubborn. ”In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump said, “If Powell doesn’t ‘substantially’ lower rates, THE BOARD SHOULD ASSUME CONTROL, AND DO WHAT EVERYONE KNOWS HAS TO BE DONE!”The US president, who has nominated several members to the Fed board, has repeatedly criticised Powell for maintaining the central bank’s benchmark rate — currently averaging 4.33% — even as Trump pushes for a 3 percentage point cut to stimulate growth and lower government debt costs. Powell has argued that the Fed must first assess the inflationary impact of Trump’s broad tariff regime before adjusting policy, AP reported.Two Fed governors — Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman — both dissented at the Fed’s meeting on Wednesday, issuing statements that suggested a more dovish stance. They said the recent inflation uptick was likely a one-time effect and the job market showed signs of softening.Trump seized on these internal disagreements.“STRONG DISSENTS ON FED BOARD,” Trump posted. “IT WILL ONLY GET STRONGER!”Despite claiming that the US economy is booming, Trump has repeatedly insisted that inflation is virtually nonexistent — even though the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge is running at an annualised rate of 2.6%, slightly above its 2% target.Friday’s jobs report added fuel to Trump’s demands, showing only 73,000 jobs were created in July. Revisions lowered June and May figures to 19,000 and 14,000 respectively, indicating a sharper-than-expected slowdown.Trump contends aggressive rate cuts would boost growth and help homebuyers and the federal budget. But some economists warn that such steep cuts could release more liquidity than the economy can absorb, risking higher inflation.The dispute has also turned legal. A May ruling by the US Supreme Court indicated that Powell cannot be removed solely for policy differences. However, the Trump administration is reportedly exploring whether Powell can be dismissed “for cause,” citing cost overruns in the Fed’s ongoing $2.5 billion renovation project.Powell’s current term as Fed Chair ends in May 2026.

Pakistan Set To Get US Crude Oil



Pakistan Faces 19% Tariff

Pakistan is set to get its first crude oil shipment from the US later this year after US President Donald Trump announced a trade deal with the country. Trump also said that the US will be helping Pakistan develop ‘massive oil reserves’.The agreement came after several rounds of discussions that commenced in April, following US President Donald Trump's announcement to levy 29% tariffs on Pakistani imports.Cnergyico, Pakistan's biggest refinery, has finalised a deal with Vitol to import 1 million barrels of American oil, according to vice chairman Usama Qureshi's statement to Reuters on Friday. This is Pakistan's first acquisition of US crude oil following a significant trade agreement.Pakistan's largest import commodity is oil, with imports valued at $11.3 billion for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2025, which is approximately one-fifth of the nation's total imports.Also Read | Donald Trump to help Pakistan build ‘massive oil reserves’!

Return increased revenues from abroad to American patients and taxpayers: Trump said domestic MFN pricing should push drug makers to negotiate tougher deals with foreign buyers, and the extra revenue must be used to lower domestic costs.



Enable direct purchasing at MFN pricing: Adopt direct-to-consumer and direct-to-business distribution for widely used prescription drugs, allowing Americans access to the same low prices typically reserved for third-party payers.



US President Donald Trump issued a sharp warning to pharmaceutical giants, calling on them to slash prescription drug prices in the United States or face the consequences.In letters addressed to 17 major drug companies, Trump urged them to cooperate with his administration to implement sweeping reforms aimed at lowering costs for American patients, who currently pay some of the highest drug prices in the developed world.These firms are Eli Lilly and Company, Sanofi, Regeneron Pharma, Merek, GSK, Johnson & Johnson, Genentech, Amgen, AstraZeneca, Novo Nordisk, Pfizer, EMD Serono, Gilead Sciences, Novartis, Bristol Myers Squibb, Boehringer Ingelheim, AbbVie.“If you refuse to step up we will deploy every tool in our arsenal to protect American families from continued abusive drug pricing practices,” Trump wrote in the letters, which were published on his platform, Truth Social.The push follows an executive order Trump signed on May 12, 2025, titled Delivering Most-Favored-Nation Prescription Drug Pricing to American Patients. The order is designed to end what Trump called “global freeloading” by foreign governments benefiting from lower prices on American-developed medicines.According to the White House, drug prices in the US are on average up to three times higher than in other developed countries for the same medications.Trump has blamed this on “an unacceptable burden on hardworking American families” and vowed to put a stop to it.In the letters, Trump said that most proposals his administration had received from the pharmaceutical industry offered “more of the same: shifting blame and requesting policy changes that would result in billions of dollars in handouts to industry.”Instead, he laid out a clear list of demands to be fulfilled within 60 days:“My team, including secretary Kennedy and Administrator Oz, stand ready to implement these terms,” Trump said. “I expect you to further engage with them immediately, in good faith, to deliver relief for American families.”The US President highlighted achieving global price parity would be the most effective outcome for all stakeholders, but he warned that failure to comply would prompt government action.“Americans are demanding lower drug prices and they need them today,” he added. “Other nations have been freeloading on US innovation for far too long; it is time they pay their fair share.”He concluded the letter by asking for binding commitments by September 29, and promised support for implementation queries.The move marks one of Trump’s most aggressive attempts to tackle the long-standing issue of inflated prescription drug prices in the United States.","US President Donald Trump issued a sharp warning to pharmaceutical giants, calling on them to slash prescription drug prices in the United States.

Canada slams tariffs as ‘tact-less turbulence’

A 'major success' for Thailand

Cambodia gets 'the best news'

Taiwan hopes for more cuts

A sweeping new wave of tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump has triggered a flurry of responses from trading partners around the globe.Thursday’s announcement unveiled new or sharply increased tariffs on dozens of countries, with rates ranging from a baseline tariff of 10% to as high as 41%. The sweeping move has prompted a wide range of responses, as each nation scrambles to protect its economic interests.The newly announced tariffs would be taking place from August 7.Here's how some have responded:Canada sharply criticised the US move to hike tariffs from 25% to 35%. The decision, laid out in a White House fact sheet citing “Canada’s continued inaction and retaliation,” will take effect from August 1, CNN reported.Candace Laing, President and CEO of Canada’s Chamber of Commerce, launched a sharp attack on increased tariffs.“The White House fact sheet should be called a fact-less sheet when it comes to basing trade decisions about Canada on the fentanyl emergency,” she said.“More fact-less tariff turbulence does not advance North American economic security. Businesses — in Canada and the US— urgently need certainty.”Laing further praised Canadian PM Mark Carney for refusing to be rushed into a deal, calling his approach “strong” and “future-focused.”Thailand described the outcome of its talks with Washington as a diplomatic victory, welcoming a 19% tariff rate instead of the originally threatened 36%.“This finalised deal, setting US import tariffs at 19%, marks a major success for Thailand,” government spokesman Jirayu Huangsab said in a statement.“It represents a win-win approach aimed at preserving Thailand's export base and long-term economic stability.”The US goods trade deficit with Thailand rose to $45.6 billion in 2024, up 11.7% from the previous year. The southeast Asian nation has faced economic headwinds since the pandemic and recently downgraded its 2025 growth forecast to between 2.3% and 3.3%.The tariff deal came on the heels of Trump’s diplomatic involvement in brokering a ceasefire between Thailand and Cambodia after five days of border clashes that killed over 40 people and displaced 300,000.Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet welcomed the 19% tariff deal with the US, which averted the harsher 36% levy initially planned.“This is the best news for the people and economy of Cambodia to continue to develop the country,” he wrote on Facebook.The development follows days of deadly border conflict with Thailand, which was halted after US diplomatic intervention earlier in the week.Taiwan vowed to continue negotiations with Washington after Trump imposed a ""temporary"" 20% levy on its exports, which could have been as high as 32%.""The US has announced a temporary 20% tariff for Taiwan, with the possibility of further reductions should an agreement be reached,"" President Lai Ching-te said on Facebook.""The government will continue to strive for a reasonable tariff rate and complete the final stages of the tariff negotiations.""Semiconductor powerhouse Taiwan has seen soaring demand for its AI-related chips, which make up the bulk of its trade surplus with the US. Nearly 60% of its exports to the US are information and communications technology products.In an effort to soften the blow, Taipei pledged increased investment in the US, more energy imports from American producers, and higher defence spending.Taiwan’s Vice President Hsiao Bi-khim emphasised the mutual value in maintaining strong US-Taiwan trade relations.“The United States is indeed a very important trade partner for Taiwan,” Hsiao said.America also needs Taiwan in supporting resilient supply chains, in supporting manufacturing and some high-end technologies.More countries, like Syria, Switzerland, Laos are expected to respond as the new deadline of August 7 looms.","US President Donald Trump announced new or sharply increased tariffs on dozens of countries.

'National interests first': Where does India stand amid this tariff flurry

US President Donald Trump on Thursday signed a sweeping executive order imposing higher tariffs on several nations and the 27-member European Union, significantly escalating his administration’s global trade offensive. The order, titled ""Further Modifying The Reciprocal Tariff Rates"", is set to take effect from August 7, seven days after its issuance, with rates going up to 41%.India has been slapped with a 25 per cent ""Reciprocal Tariff, Adjusted"", one of the higher rates among key US trading partners. The White House justified the move by citing India’s “obnoxious non-monetary trade barriers,” persistent trade imbalances, and strong energy and defense ties with Russia.While the initial tariff deadline was August 1, the implementation was deferred to August 7 to allow US Customs and Border Protection time to update its systems.The extension reflects the govt’s need for more time to harmonise the tariff rates, according to a senior official who spoke to Associated Press reporters on condition of anonymity.The tariff hike is part of Trump’s effort to rebalance what he terms unfair trade deficits and national security risks.Countries with large trade surpluses with the US or insufficient strategic alignment have been hit with the steepest increases.The steepest hikes include 41 per cent on Syria, 40 per cent on Laos and Myanmar, 39 per cent on Switzerland, 35 per cent on Iraq, Serbia and Canada.In South Asia, India faces a 25 per cent tariff, while Pakistan has been hit with 19 per cent, according to the new Executive order.The US has announced adjusted reciprocal tariffs on 95 countries and territories, ranging from 10 per cent to 41 per cent, based on trade deficits and strategic alignment.Also read: ‘Major success’ or ‘factless turbulence’? Here's how nations reacted to Trump's new tariffs The US has announced adjusted reciprocal tariffs on several countries and territories, ranging from 10 per cent to 41 per cent, based on trade deficits and strategic alignment. Here's what country faces what rate:The US has openly linked its new tariff measures on India to frustrations over New Delhi’s continued purchases of Russian oil and arms. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said India’s energy trade with Russia is “most certainly a point of irritation” in ties, as it helps sustain Moscow’s war effort in Ukraine. While acknowledging India as a strategic partner with major energy needs, Rubio added that Washington is “clearly frustrated” that India continues to buy large volumes of discounted Russian oil despite the availability of other global vendors.Also read: Donald Trump administration fires fresh salvo after 25% tariff; says Russia oil ‘most certainly a point of irritation’ Trump’s imposition of a 25 per cent tariff on Indian goods and an additional penalty for Russian dealings is seen as a sharp expression of that dissatisfaction. Trump also accused India of maintaining “obnoxious” non-monetary trade barriers and failing to open up its market to American goods.The government, meanwhile, has reiterated that it will act in its national interest. The Ministry of Commerce said it is assessing the impact of the new tariffs and penalties, while also emphasising that discussions with the US for a fair and reciprocal trade agreement are ongoing. Five rounds of negotiations have taken place, with a sixth round expected later this month. India has maintained a firm stance on key issues such as agriculture and dairy, where it has resisted US demands for greater market access.Also read: No F-35 jets from US for India?

"Trump's Pak oil deal a move to counter China, pressure India?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/trumps-pak-oil-deal-a-move-to-counter-china-pressure-india/articleshow/123027257.cms,"‘Modi Is a Friend But…’:US President Donald Trump after imposing 25% Tariff on India

NEW DELHI : President Donald Trump's announcement of a deal to develop Pakistan's ""massive oil reserves"" sounds more like a strategic manoeuvre on the South Asian chessboard to counter Islamabad's growing dependence on Beijing and pressure India over the trade deal, rather than a realistic assessment of the country's immediate hydrocarbons potential.Various estimates peg Pakistan’s 'proven' reserves of conventional oil at 0.2 billion barrels and natural gas at 529.5 billion cubic meters. These appear modest even when compared to India, which, at last count, was estimated to have oil reserves of about 4.8 billion barrels and natural gas reserves of 1149 billion cubic meters.Pakistan's domestic production, meeting 15-18% of oil and about 60% of gas demand, also has remained modest as exploration efforts yielded incremental discoveries.Claims by leaders in recent times have given rise to speculations over ""mother-of-all"" oil and gas deposits in Sindh and Karachi offshore. All these claims, however, remain unverified in the absence of commercial drilling activities, even as US major Exxon and ENI of Italy have ended surveys.In case deposits are found to be commercially viable, they will take $5-10 billion and 5-7 years to develop. Given the location of the possible deposits, especially in strife-torn Balochistan and areas bordering Iran, it is doubtful whether US companies will be willing to invest such large risk capital in an economy in economic disarray.Trump may be betting on a 2015 US Energy Information Agency study estimating a potential of 9.1 billion barrels of ""technically recoverable"" shale oil and 105 trillion cubic feet of shale gas. This is one area where US shale companies and wildcatters may get interested. But then, technically recoverable is not proven or commercially viable. That leaves many imponderables for explorers.","Trump's announcement of a deal to develop Pakistan's ""massive oil reserves"" sounds more like a strategic manoeuvre to counter Islamabad's growing dependence on Beijing.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume.

Stay informed with the latest business news, updates on bank holidays and public holidays.





Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.","Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain.

The Series A funding round was led by Lightspeed Venture Partners, and participants included Silicon Valley billionaire Vinod Khosla’s Khosla Ventures and Peak XV Partners, formerly Sequoia Capital India & Southeast Asia, Sarvam said Thursday.The Bangalore-based startup, until recently in stealth mode, was co-founded by Vivek Raghavan and Pratyush Kumar.

The startup has a total of 18 employees and is just opening an office in the city.""What we are showing is that you can build large language models with limited resources,” Raghavan said in a phone interview. ""We are building at a smaller scale and demonstrating that these can be extremely cost and energy efficient so they can be accessed by everyone.""Large language models, like OpenAI’s GPT-4 and Meta Platforms Inc.’s Llama, are powerful AI systems that understand by learning from vast amounts of diverse data from the internet and elsewhere to summarize, translate, and create text, audio and video for a wide range of applications.

Startups will play important role in helping India become 3rd largest economy: CEA Nageswaran,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/startups-will-play-important-role-in-helping-india-become-3rd-largest-economy-cea-nageswaran/articleshow/105332523.cms,"Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor ( CEA ) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran Udaan until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.Udaan built an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business still accounts for a very small part of India’s overall retail market but can balloon to $150 billion in sales and yield a 100% return on capital invested in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co. estimates published in the Mint newspaper.Bengaluru-based Udaan has also ventured into financing through its fintech unit which helps shopkeepers get working capital loans to buy inventory. That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says.

How India's GDP has been growing

What SBI report said on savings and investment

Incremental capital output ratio

NEW DELHI: India's gross domestic product (GDP) data for the third quarter (October-December 2022) received a word of caution from the former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan In an interview with news agency PTI, Rajan that India is ""dangerously close"" to the Hindu rate of growth in view of subdued private sector investment, high interest rates and slowing global growth.India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying"".However, a report released by the State Bank of India (SBI) economists on Tuesday dismissed arguments that India is dangerously close to Hindu rate of growth saying such statements are ""ill-conceived, biased and premature"".The term 'Hindu growth rate' was coined by late economist Raj Krishna in 1978 to describe the slow growth in the country.It basically refers to the low pace of economic growth rates during 1950s to 1980s. During this period, the Indian economy averaged 3.5%.A former lecturer at the Delhi School of Economics (DSE), Krishna noted that only if the rate of growth is persistently slow and accompanied by low per-capita GDP, then it will be known as Hindu rate of growth but it has to factor in population growth as well.Before economic reforms of 1991, India's economic growth remained stagnant and low, while per capita income averaged around 1.3%. Krishna termed this low growth situation to be a result of socialist policies of state control and import substitution.However, the economic situation changed when liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation (LPG) reforms came into effect in the year 1991, at a time when India faced balance of payment crisis.Over the years, many economists have strongly opposed the idea of 'Hindu growth rate' and the term never had universal acceptance.The Indian economy plunged into its very first technical recession in FY21 due to the impact of Covid-19 pandemic and the related nationwide lockdowns. GDP shrunk by an unprecedented 23.8% in the first quarter of the financial year 2020-21. However, due to spurt in economic activities in the subsequent quarters, the GDP decline started to narrow.However, if we look at the period before Covid-19 as well, India's growth curve shows a declining trend.From 8.26% in FY17, GDP growth plunged to 3.74% in FY20. Shutdown of economic activities in FY21 in wake of Covid-19 only made matters worse.As lockdowns started to ease and business activities resumed, India's GDP also started rising. In Q1 of FY22, growth jumped to 20.1% mainly on account of low base effect. By the fourth quarter of FY22, growth came down to 4.10%.Similarly, the new financial year 2022-23 brought fresh economic challenges in the form of Russia-Ukraine war that impacted almost all major economies of the world, slowed the pace of growth, pushed inflation to record highs.As a result, the central banks of all advanced economies spurred into action and opted for monetary policy tightening to curb the soaring inflation.With persistently rising interest rates, India's economy grew by 4.4% in Q3 of FY23, as the Centre revised upwards GDP growth for previous year to 9.10% from 8.7% earlier.The report weighed recent GDP numbers against the available data on savings and investments for the past decade and highlighted some interesting points.""Quarterly growth numbers are noisy and should be best avoided for any serious interpretation (on an average, India's GDP growth has witnessed Rs 2 lakh crore upward revision for the 3 year ended FY23),"" the report said.Gross capital formation (GCF) by the government touched a high of 11.8% in 2021-22, up from 10.7% in 2020-21.""This also had a domino effect on private sector investment that jumped from 10 per cent to 10.8% over the same period,"" it said.In fact, Ecowrap added that the trends in GCF to gross output ratio or the plough back of funds for creation of fresh capacity shows that for public administration the ratio attained fresh peak in 2021-22 owing to the emphasis on capital expenditure in recent budgets.At the aggregate level, gross capital formation is supposed to have crossed 32% in 2022-23, the highest level since 2018-19.According to the report, in 2021-22, gross savings have risen to 30% from 29% in 2020-21.""The ratio is supposed to have crossed 31 per cent in 2022-23, the highest since 2018-19. The household savings increased sharply during the pandemic period on account of sharp accretion in financial savings such as deposits,"" said the report by SBI's Economic Research Department.While household financial savings have since then moderated from 15.4% in 2020-21 to 11.1% in 2022-23, savings in physical assets have grown sharply to 11.8% in 2021-22 from 10.7% in 2020-21.The report further analysed Incremental Capital Output ratio (ICOR) -- which measures additional units of capital (investment) needed to produce additional units of output. It said that the ratio has been improving.""ICOR which was 7.5 in FY 12 is now only 3.5 in FY22. Clearly, only half of capital is now needed for next unit of output,"" the report noted.Such reducing ICOR in the current years reflects a relatively increasing efficiency of capital and shows that the economy is on a sound footing, the report said.""From that point of view, future GDP growth rates even at 7% could still mean a decent number by any standards!,"" it added.","India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.

An employee is entitled for a 50 per cent amount of the last drawn salary as pension.OPS was discontinued by the NDA government in 2003 with effect from April 1, 2004.Under the new pension scheme (NPS), employees contribute 10 per cent of their basic salary towards pension while the government contributes 14 per cent.Governments of Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand have informed the central government/ Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA about their decision to restart OPS for their employees.The government of Punjab on November 18, 2022, issued a notification regarding implementation of OPS for the state government employees who are being covered under NPS. Jharkhand too has decided to revert to OPS.",Former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan has expressed his concern over the decision of some states to restart the old pension scheme.

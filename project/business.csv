AAA projects 81.8 million Thanksgiving travellers

Americans are set for a mix of family meals and early holiday shopping this week, with most big retailers staying shut on Thanksgiving before reopening at dawn for Black Friday, the unofficial start of the Christmas buying rush. The week also marks what AAA says will be the busiest Thanksgiving travel period on record, according to AP report.Most national retailers — including Walmart, Target, Macy’s, Kohl’s and Costco — will remain closed on Thursday, returning with early openings from 5 a.m. or 6 a.m. on Black Friday. CVS will shut early, and Walgreens will close most stores except select 24-hour locations. Grocery chains will open but many will close ahead of schedule, with timings varying by area.Government offices, post offices, courts and schools will be closed. US banks and stock markets will also shut for the day, reopening on Friday for a shortened trading session that ends at 1 p.m. Eastern. Standard FedEx and UPS pickup and delivery services will not operate on Thursday, though limited critical services will be available at certain locations.With schools closed and a long weekend ahead, travel is expected to surge.AAA estimates that 81.8 million people will journey at least 50 miles between Nov. 25 and Dec. 1 — 1.6 million more than last year and a potential new record. Nearly 73 million will travel by car, aided by petrol prices holding near $3 a gallon, slightly below last Thanksgiving’s average.About 6 million Americans are expected to fly domestically, a 2% rise from 2024, though cancellations or delays could shift the final count. Another 2.5 million travellers will rely on buses, trains or cruise ships, marking an 8.5% increase from last year.For many households, Thursday offers a quiet holiday — before the weekend turns into one of the year’s busiest on the roads, at airports and at shop entrances.","AAA projects 81.8 million Thanksgiving travellers.

Implementation of the new labour codes is expected to deliver a Rs 75,000-crore consumption boost and raise the share of the formal workforce by at least 15 per cent, according to a research note by economists at SBI on Tuesday.The four codes, enforced from November 21, will also expand social security coverage to up to 85 per cent within the next three years and help reduce the unemployment rate by 1.3 per cent over the medium term, the note said, PTI reported.“With a saving rate of approx 30 per cent, the implementation will result in a consumption boost Rs 66 per person per day post-implementation. This could lead to an approx consumption boost of Rs 75,000 crore,” the SBI economists said.They added that the new framework will empower both workers and enterprises, creating a labour market that is “protected, productive and aligned with the evolving world of work.”SBI economists said India has around 44 crore unorganised workers, of whom 31 crore are registered on the e-Shram portal.Assuming 20 per cent of these workers transition into the formal payroll system, nearly 10 crore people would benefit — pushing social security coverage to 80–85 per cent in the next two to three years.Citing the Periodic Labour Force Survey, the note said 60.4 per cent of India’s workforce is currently formal. The bank expects formalisation to rise by 15.1 per cent under the new regime.The impact on unemployment will depend on “reform implementation, firm-level adjustment costs, and complementary state-level rules,” the report said.","The four codes, enforced from November 21, will expand social security coverage to up to 85 per cent within the next three years.

Rare Earth Permanent Magnets Scheme: Top Points

To promote manufacturing of sintered Rare Earth Permanent Magnets

Focus on value chain: integrated manufacturing facilities, conversion of rare earth oxides to metals, metals to alloys and alloys to finished REPMs

Investment: Rs 7,280 crore

Creating capacity of 6 thousand Metric Tons Per Annum (MTPA)

5 units of 1,200 MTPA capacity to be set up

Scheme duration: 7 years including 2 years for setting up manufacturing unit

India bets on Atmanirbharta for rare earths! In a boost to India's domestic rare earth manufacturing capabilities, PM Narendra Modi-led Union Cabinet on Wednesday cleared an over Rs 7,200 crore Rare Earth Permanent Magnets (REPM) Scheme. The scheme aims to establish integrated manufacturing facilities with a capacity of 6,000 Metric Tons per Annum (MTPA) of Rare Earth Permanent Magnets. The initiative hopes to strengthen India's self-sufficiency and global market presence.REPMs, believed to be amongst the most powerful permanent magnets available, serve as essential components in various sectors including electric vehicles, renewable energy, electronics, aerospace and defence industries. Currently dependent on imports for REPM needs, this initiative marks India's first integrated REPM manufacturing facilities, creating jobs, enhancing self-sufficiency and supporting the country's Net Zero target by 2070. The scheme includes Rs 6,450 crore as sales-linked incentives for REPM sales over five years, alongside Rs 750 crore capital subsidy for establishing 6,000 MTPA of REPM production facilities.Announcing the decision, Information and Broadcasting Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw stressed on the strategic importance of the initiative ,which is a first-of-its kind. “This is a very important, strategic decision,” he said. According to Vaishnaw India has one of the largest rare earth deposits in the world.At present, India remains significantly dependent on imports of rare-earth permanent magnets, with China being the main source. The scheme is part of India’s comprehensive strategy to establish secure supply chains for essential minerals whilst developing domestic technological capabilities in emerging industrial domains.The approved scheme will facilitate the development of comprehensive REPM manufacturing units that will oversee the entire process from converting rare earth oxides into metals, transforming metals into alloys, and finally producing finished REPMs.India expects a twofold increase in REPM consumption by 2030 compared to 2025, primarily due to higher demand from electric vehicles, renewable energy, industrial sectors and consumer electronics.Through a global competitive bidding procedure, the scheme plans to distribute the total capacity among five recipients. Each selected recipient will receive an allocation of up to 1,200 MTPA capacity.The scheme's implementation spans seven years from the award date, incorporating a two-year establishment period for integrated REPM manufacturing facilities, followed by five years dedicated to disbursing incentives for REPM sales.The scheme's focus on developing local REPM production expertise will ensure a secure supply chain for national industries and contribute towards achieving the country's Net Zero 2070 targets.","The scheme aims to establish integrated manufacturing facilities with a capacity of 6,000 Metric Tons per Annum (MTPA) of Rare Earth Permanent Magnets.

Gold and silver price prediction today:

MCX Gold has decisively broken above its recent consolidation zone, signalling renewed strength in the ongoing uptrend. This breakout suggests that bullish momentum is taking hold again, increasing the probability of a continued rally toward the 1,29,000 level in the coming sessions. The price structure now indicates that buyers are firmly in control, and dips are likely to attract fresh demand.The broader bias remains strongly positive as long as MCX Gold sustains above the 1,24,000 support zone. This level has acted as a crucial floor in recent weeks, preventing deeper corrections and offering a solid base for the current upward move. Holding above this zone reinforces the trend, giving traders and investors confidence that the market is still aligned toward higher targets.If the price maintains its position above this support and continues to build on the breakout, the next leg of the rally could unfold with increased momentum.However, a decisive drop below 1,24,000 would be required to weaken the bullish structure and raise concerns of a trend reversal. For now, the technical outlook favours the upside, with 1,29,000 emerging as the next significant resistance zone to watch.Just like gold, silver is also showing signs of renewed strength and appears poised for a continued upward move. The price action in recent sessions has been marked by a sustainable and steady uptrend, indicating that buyers are firmly supporting the market. This consistent momentum increases the likelihood of silver advancing toward the 1,63,000 level in the near term, provided the broader trend remains favourable.The recent breakout and follow-through buying suggest that the metal is gaining confidence among market participants. Such sustained upward movement often reflects improving sentiment and opens the door for further positive possibilities. As long as the trend structure remains intact, silver may continue attracting momentum-based buying on minor dips.On the downside, the immediate support is placed around the 1,54,500 level. This zone has played a crucial role in cushioning declines and maintaining the bullish pattern. Holding above this support will be essential for the ongoing upward trajectory to remain valid. A breach of this level could slow the momentum, but as long as the price stays comfortably above it, the broader outlook remains constructive.Overall, silver’s technical setup continues to favour the bulls, with higher targets remaining achievable if key supports hold firm.","Gold and silver prices are showing strength again, says Abhilash Koikkara, Head - Forex & Commodities, Nuvama Professional Clients Group.

According to AP, jobless claims fell by 6,000 to 216,000 in the week ending November 22, undershooting economists’ expectations of 230,000.Applications for unemployment aid — a key proxy for layoffs — remain at levels consistent with a healthy job market. AP reported that job cuts disclosed by companies such as UPS and Amazon typically take longer to show up in weekly claims data. The four-week average of claims eased by 1,000 to 223,750.For now, the US labour market appears to be in a “low-hire, low-fire” phase, keeping unemployment historically low but slowing the pace at which jobseekers find work. The number of Americans receiving jobless benefits rose by 7,000 to 1.96 million in the week ending November 15, suggesting longer job searches.Government data last week showed hiring picked up modestly in September with employers adding 119,000 jobs, though August saw job losses. The unemployment rate edged up to 4.4%, a four-year high, as more people re-entered the workforce.Retail sales slowed in September after three months of solid gains, while consumer confidence slipped to its second-lowest level in five years and wholesale inflation eased.

NEW DELHI: The income tax department has launched a fresh campaign to nudge those with overseas assets or income to disclose details in India. Initially, around 25,000 high-risk cases will be targeted through SMS and e-mails, with the campaign proposed to be expanded mid-Dec to cover others, and improve the compliance ecosystem.The initiative comes exactly a year after a similar move led to nearly 25,000 taxpayers disclosing Rs 29,000 crore overseas assets and income of Rs 1,090 crore.Following analysis of data for 2024, from other tax jurisdictions, Central Board of Direct Taxes has identified high-risk cases in which foreign assets seem to exist, but have not been reported in FY 2024-25 I-T returns, a statement said.The “second NUDGE campaign” will advise taxpayers to review and revise their returns by Dec 31 to avoid penal consequences. “The campaign aims at facilitating correct reporting in Schedule Foreign Assets and Foreign Source Income (FSI) in ITRs.

JP Morgan has raised the base case for the nifty target to 30,000 points for end-2026. Analysts feel with supportive fiscal and monetary policies, recovering domestic demand and broad-based sectoral growth, corporate earnings are set to rebound. They feel India’s valuations remain at a premium, but the gap with emerging markets has compressed to below the long-term average. A resolution in the US-India trade relations could trigger a re-rating in the near term. Macquarie, another large foreign broking house in India believes that the balance of risk has tilted favourably with nifty more likely to end 2026 closer to 30K than 20K levels. Analysts feel in 2026, India would come out of hibernation. Hence, from a cautious view on the India equity markets for 2025, they are now turning more optimistic on the top-down outlook for 2026. They see India’s outperformance would be driven by a revival in earnings growth premium, recovery in consumer spends, and resumption of foreign flows.Jefferies has a buy rating on PB Fintech with the target price at Rs 2,100. Analysts said that the company indicated that premium growth would continue to sustain around 30%.In addition, despite recent GST changes, the company expects take rates to stay stable through initiatives like higher riders, protection attachment, duration and mix change. They think that premium growth and operating leverage will drive strong profits and cash flows. They also said that PB Fintech’s hospital network initiative is in its early stages.HSBC has upgraded Bayer Corp’s rating to buy with the target price at Rs 5,200. Analysts expect an improved performance in the Oct-March half (H2FY26) with better industry dynamics and opportunities in the corn seeds business. They feel that the new product launches would support growth and fine tuning of the distribution and sourcing strategies to drive margin recovery. They upgraded the stock as they feel that the worst appears to be behind it.Goldman Sachs has a buy rating on Tata Consumer Products with the target price at Rs 1,350. Analysts feel the company is well positioned in growth categories and growth channels. Its salt business has headroom for growth driven by market share gain and premiumisation. It has also chalked out a range of initiatives for its ‘Growth’ segments. Analysts feel that the near term margins are improving from lower input costs, while the medium term aspirations are for a 17%-20% margin.ICICI Securities has a buy rating on Travel Food Services with the target price at Rs 1,600. Analysts feel the company’s structural growth story is gaining altitude. It has a superior execution strategy to further consolidate TFS' leading position in travel QSR and lounge business.

However, profit-taking at higher levels brought the index down from the intraday peak of 86,056 points to close at 85,720, up 111 points on the day.Nifty too followed a similar path. It touched a new life-high mark at 26,310 points in early trades but closed at 26,216 points. Both the indices are at all-time high levels on a closing level too. It took both the indices 14 months to scale new levels.The recent rally has been reinforced by expectations of rate cuts from both RBI and the US Federal Reserve — a shift that improves visibility for interest-rate-sensitive sectors and could trigger renewed foreign fund inflows, Ajay Menon, MD & CEO (wealth management), Motilal Oswal Financial Services, said.Combined with these factors, early signs of a corporate earnings recovery from the current quarter, supported by GST rationalisation and improving rural demand, optimism around a potential trade agreement between the US and India has further strengthened investor sentiment, Menon said.The day’s rally, however, was concentrated in large cap stocks with BSE’s midcap and smallcap indices, both closing in the red.As a result, investors’ wealth, represented by BSE’s market capitalisation, for the day slid slightly—from Rs 474.9 lakh crore on Wednesday, it was at Rs 474.3 lakh crore at Thursday’s close, official data showed.In Thursday’s market, among the 30 sensex constituents, the advance-decline ratio was equally balanced with 15 winners to 15 losers. In the broader market, however, the ratio was skewed in favour of the laggards—compared to 1,936 advances, there were 2,220 declines, BSE data showed.The rally that took the sensex to a new high, started in Oct when the sensex was at about 80,200 points. Since then, in Oct, foreign funds had turned net buyers after three months of net outflow. The last leg of the sensex rally, however, came despite a record-low rupee against the dollar and a marginal net outflow by foreign funds. Market players say this demonstrates that domestic funds, flush with flows through the mutual fund SIP route, most of which goes into equity schemes, have been the main driver of the rally.Market participants would keep a close eye on India’s GDP data for the Sept quarter (set to be announced on Friday), as well as key triggers such as US–India trade deal and RBI policy announcement on Dec 5, a note by Bajaj Broking said.","Nifty too followed a similar path.

The favourable impact of GST rationalisation is increasingly visible in consumption indicators, while robust agriculture activity - reflected in the strong onset of Rabi sowing and adequate reservoir levels - has reinforced the outlook for food supply and rural incomes.The report said that corporate performance remains healthy, with sustained profitability and stable balance sheets.It said domestic financial markets continue to draw strength from firm institutional participation. ""Meanwhile, the external sector remains shaped by a complex global environment, although the persistent strength in services exports provides an important counterbalance to the volatility in merchandise trade,"" said the report.It said the inflation outlook remains encouraging, supported by softening global commodity prices, benign energy markets, and targeted domestic supply interventions.","The economy enters the second half of FY26 on a stable footing, anchored by well-contained inflation, resilient domestic demand and supportive policy dynamics.

Expansion spree: Ikea plans to add 4-5 stores every year,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/expansion-spree-ikea-plans-to-add-4-5-stores-every-year/articleshow/125627081.cms,"MUMBAI: Ikea is stepping up India expansion with plans to open four to five stores annually in the market where people are widening their budgets for home furnishing and decor, boosting growth prospects.This compares with all of six stores that the Swedish company launched in the country through the first seven years of its retail operations here. Patrik Antoni who took over as the India CEO in Aug said that Ikea has broadened its portfolio here, customised them to suit local nuances, built logistics network in major cities which helps it keep prices lower besides becoming more targeted in terms of the consumer cohorts they want to reach-strategies that have paid off and sets it up well for an aggressive expansion now.The company's sourcing business in India is way bigger than retail but Ikea is betting on the long-term opportunity that the market presents with a much younger demographic than its Western counterparts and population expansion in metros as more people migrate to bigger cities for jobs. ""Now, we feel that we have a good base to take the leap forward. It's a big change. We won't build everything. It (store launches) will be through a mix of lease and own construction.The lease model enables faster expansion. We are looking for land to start more projects but nothing has been closed yet,"" Antoni said in an interview.Ikea competes with players such as Godrej Interio, Reliance Retail's Urban Ladder and Pepperfry in India. Local startups failed to grow in the market, eventually settling for acquisitions by other companies. Reliance Retail bought Urban Ladder in 2020 while Pepperfry that was once targeting a public debut was acquired by TCC Concept earlier this year. Ikea will open stores through a mix of formats in India with the expansion initially limited to six metros-Mumbai, Delhi-NCR, Pune, Chennai, Bengaluru and Hyderabad.""This is because we have a solid logistical backbone in these cities. Efficiencies in distribution help to keep prices lower,"" said Antoni, shrugging off the idea of quick deliveries. ""In all markets, it's one day delivery most of the time. We will try a bit with shorter windows (does not imply in minutes) to see if it gets any traction but people will rarely need a sofa (to give an example) in 10 minutes and I don't think it can be delivered in 10 minutes,"" Antoni said.Online channel is growing faster for Ikea-contributing over 25% of revenues but its focus will be to build an omni-channel play. ""For us, online and offline go together. If we open a store in an area, online sales of that region grow,"" said Antoni. As it targets working professionals moving cities for jobs and nuclear families looking to spend on aesthetic spaces, Ikea is also betting big on food offerings.","Ikea has broadened its portfolio here, customised them to suit local nuances.

"What do new labour codes mean for employees & employers? From minimum wages, gratuity benefits to appointment letters & layoff rules",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/what-do-new-labour-codes-mean-for-employees-employers-from-minimum-wages-gratuity-benefits-to-appointment-letters-layoff-rules-top-things-to-know/articleshow/125545231.cms,"The new codes aim to increase women's employment opportunities, ensure worker safety, extend social security benefits to gig workers. (AI image)



Explained: How new labour laws could hit your take-home salary, increase your provident fund & gratuity contributions

These new labour codes will replace 29 existing labour laws. These codes are:

The Code on Wages, 2019

The Code on Social Security, 2020

The Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions Code, 2020

The Industrial Relations Code, 2020

Result of Rationalizing Labour Laws

What should employees know about the new labour codes?

There will now be separate classifications for 'employee' and 'worker', with different benefits allocated to each category.

A 'worker' means someone who belongs to the 'workman' category from the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, including individuals who perform manual, unskilled, skilled, technical, operational, clerical, or supervisory duties.

It excludes those in 'supervisory', 'managerial', or 'administrative' positions. Whilst the earlier legislation primarily addressed industrial disputes and retrenchment, the current definition has expanded considerably.

Workers will receive specific entitlements, including overtime compensation and leave encashment, as per the Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions Code, 2020. Regulations regarding working hours, annual leave, and standing orders apply specifically to 'workers'.

The codes bring in a unified 'wages' definition across all four sections. Earlier, multiple interpretations of 'wages' and 'salary' created difficulties in benefit calculations, which then resulted in inconsistencies and even legal disputes.

This 'wages' definition now applies to calculations for Gratuity, Employees' State Insurance, Leave Encashment, Overtime, Statutory Bonus, and other benefits. This standardisation aims to improve compliance through greater clarity.

Fixed term employees will get all benefits equal to permanent workers. This includes leave, medical, and social security. They will be eligible for gratuity after just one year, instead of the current five. Additionally, they will get equal wages as permanent staff, increasing income and protection.

To put it simply, gig workers and the unorganized sector will finally see social security benefits.

The new labour laws allow for companies that employ fewer than 300 workers to do layoffs and retrenchments without seeking prior governmental approval.

What are the key provisions of the new labour codes?

What do the new labour codes mean for employers?

Evaluate employment roles: Identify the employees who would qualify as ‘workers’ based on their substantial nature of work.

Identify the employees who would qualify as ‘workers’ based on their substantial nature of work. Assess the impact of the definition of ‘wages’ on employees’ salary structure: Review salary structure and benefits framework to comply with the new definition of ‘wages.’

Review salary structure and benefits framework to comply with the new definition of ‘wages.’ Analyze cost implications: Assess the financial impact of enhanced employee benefits on the organization.

Assess the financial impact of enhanced employee benefits on the organization. Reassess hiring models: Consider alternate hiring models in light of the provisions related to contract labour and fixed-term employment.

Consider alternate hiring models in light of the provisions related to contract labour and fixed-term employment. Align HR and Payroll policies: Ensure that HR and payroll processes comply with the labour codes and relevant state-specific regulations.

Ensure that HR and payroll processes comply with the labour codes and relevant state-specific regulations. Establish a robust compliance framework: Implement strong internal controls, conduct periodic diagnostic reviews, and ensure effective governance

New labour codes 2025: The Narendra Modi government has introduced what experts are calling a significant reform in labour laws with the implementation of four comprehensive labour codes. These codes are effective November 21, 2025. The new labour codes impact both employers and employees. The new laws mean some big benefits for workers - universal minimum wages, gratuity benefits, social security coverage, provisions for women to do night shifts, recognition of gig economy workers, formal appointment letter requirement etc. However, some provisions also raise employment security issues.The new codes aim to increase women's employment opportunities, ensuring worker safety, extending social security benefits to gig workers, and guaranteeing timely wage payments, while establishing minimum wage standards.At the same time, the new codes provide businesses increased operational flexibility whilst maintaining regulatory certainty, particularly important given current global economic challenges. Outdated labour laws have in the past deterred foreign investment in India's manufacturing sector, with companies often favouring countries like Vietnam and Bangladesh for their production facilities.Government officials indicated that rules for the four codes - covering wages, industrial relations, social security, and occupational safety and health - would be implemented within 45 days.Following their notification by 2020, the actual implementation had remained pending. The government has now officially announced the implementation. Whilst the final implementation rules from central and state governments are awaited, they are anticipated to be released soon.As Arvind Panagariya, Chairman of 16th Finance Commission wrote in TOI, “The importance of the four codes lies in breaking the ice. For the first time since the launch of reforms, they have removed the first set of hurdles in the way of creating high productivity jobs in large numbers.”These consolidated labour codes aim to streamline the existing laws, enhance digital compliance, improve workforce management systems, and strengthen worker protection along with facilitating business operations.EY is of the view that the implementation of the labour codes is a significant and long-awaited initiative by the government. “These codes are poised to impact nearly every function within organizations, given the extensive changes they introduce,” it says.“However, it may also result in increased costs for organizations due to wider scope of the definition of wages. There are still ambiguities regarding coverage of different components of salary within the definition of wages (such as coverage of performance bonuses / one-off payments, etc.),” notes EY in a note on the new Labour codes.The new labour laws restrict contract labour usage in organisations' 'core activities', barring specific exceptions. Core activity includes the main purpose of establishment creation and includes essential operations necessary for such activities.Additionally, fixed-term employment has received formal recognition as a legitimate employment arrangement, but it is contingent upon some conditions and regulatory requirements.The regulations also authorise states to implement adaptable work arrangements. Certain states, including Haryana and Odisha, have incorporated flexible working provisions in their draft regulations, permitting organisations to implement four-day work schedules, notes EY.EY notes that the labour codes significantly affect various aspects of HR and payroll policies. “Certain provisions overlap with existing state-specific Shops and Establishments laws, which are not superseded by the labour codes, potentially leading to conflicts, especially concerning working hours, leave, and related issues,” it says.Organizations operating in multiple states may have to ensure compliance with both sets of laws in each jurisdiction. Additionally, since specific provisions apply only to 'workers,' organizations may need to implement different policies for various employee categories, it adds.The new labour legislation also authorises both the central and state governments to create and execute welfare programmes for platform workers, gig economy participants, and unorganised sector employees.This can include life insurance, disability protection, healthcare provisions, maternity support, retirement security and any associated benefits.For gig worker social security arrangements, platform aggregators are required to contribute between 1-2% of their yearly turnover to the social security fund. This is subject to 5% of the amount paid or payable by an aggregator to gig workers, to the social security fund.This is a change from the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, which had set this limit at 100 workers. According to EY, the move offers businesses greater workforce management flexibility to adapt to market conditions.Additionally, the regulations also introduce a 're-skilling' fund to support any laid off workers in acquiring new skills. “For every retrenched worker, the employer is required to contribute 15 days’ last drawn wages (or any other amount notified by the central government) to a fund to be called the worker re-skilling fund,” explains EY.According to EY, It is essential for organizations to thoroughly assess the implications of these changes and prepare for a smooth transition to ensure compliance and operational efficiency. It suggests the following for organizations:The effectiveness of the new labour laws will substantially be dependent on state-level implementation, workforce education, and robust compliance monitoring.","The Narendra Modi government has introduced what experts are calling a significant reform in labour laws.

Rate call: ECB signals steady stance; policy minutes hint at openness to cuts next year,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/rate-call-ecb-signals-steady-stance-minutes-hint-at-openness-to-cuts-next-year/articleshow/125620930.cms,"The European Central Bank (ECB) sees interest rates as appropriately placed for now but has left room for potential cuts in 2026, according to minutes of its October meeting released on Thursday, AFP reported.The minutes showed that October’s unanimous decision to hold the key deposit rate at 2 per cent reflected broad agreement with Chief Economist Philip Lane’s view that inflation was under control. “Most measures of longer-term inflation expectations continued to stand at around two percent,” the minutes noted, adding that global economic activity showed signs of resilience.After two years of rate reductions, the ECB has kept rates unchanged for the past three meetings as inflation has retreated from a 2022 peak of 10.6 per cent to near the central bank’s two per cent target.However, concerns around slowing wage growth and subdued eurozone momentum — both weighing on inflation — have prompted some observers to anticipate rate cuts next year. The minutes confirmed that ECB members discussed the need to remain “entirely open-minded” about future easing.“While the economy was not so weak that it definitely implied an undershooting of the target over the medium term, it remained uncertain whether the economy had enough momentum to deliver the target,” the minutes said.

German chemical major Wacker Chemie on Thursday announced plans to cut 1,500 jobs, nearly a tenth of its global workforce, as the industry faces one of its toughest periods in decades.The company said most of the reductions will take place in Germany, with the process to be completed by the end of 2027, according to AFP.The job cuts form part of a broader plan to save more than 300 million euros ($348 million) annually. Wacker employs around 16,600 people worldwide, most of them based in Germany. Its customer base spans the automotive, construction and semiconductor sectors — all of which have been hit by slowing demand and rising competition.Shares of Wacker Chemie rose nearly 2 percent in Frankfurt after the announcement.Chief executive Christian Hartel said the operating environment for chemical firms in Germany needed urgent improvement. “The excessively high energy prices and bureaucratic obstacles continue to act as a central brake on the successful development of the chemical industry,” he said.The company had reported a net loss of more than 80 million euros in the third quarter, citing weak demand and mounting competition, particularly from China.Earlier this month, Germany’s VCI chemical industry association warned that production in the sector had slipped to a three-decade low, reflecting the broader strain on traditional industries as the country struggles to emerge from two years of recession.","Wacker Chemie announces plans to cut 1,500 jobs, nearly a tenth of its global workforce.

Hong Kong Fire Out Of Control: Over 100 Casualties, Hundreds Missing; 3 Held For Manslaughter

China Taiping's insurance exposure



'Seriously underinsured'

China Taiping Insurance Holdings Co. shares fell sharply on Thursday amid concerns over its exposure to a Hong Kong construction project linked to a devastating high-rise fire that has killed at least 44 people and left hundreds missing.The stock slid as much as 8.1% in early trading before trimming losses to about 2% by late morning in Hong Kong. Firefighters continued battling the massive blaze on Thursday, nearly 18 hours after it tore through parts of the densely populated Wang Fuk Court estate in Tai Po.The disaster was the city's worst fire in decades, which erupted suddenly on Wednesday afternoon and rapidly engulfed several sections of the 32-storey complex, home to roughly 2,000 units.Authorities have arrested three men, saying flammable materials left behind during maintenance work had allowed the fire “to spread rapidly beyond control.”The buildings had been wrapped in bamboo scaffolding, a traditional but highly flammable material still widely used in Hong Kong.The fire began around 2:50 pm on Wednesday, with the estate under repair and wrapped in bamboo scaffolding, flames spread rapidly through the eight-building complex.The precise cause remains unknown, but officials believe leftover flammable material from maintenance work played a major role in the fire’s fast escalation. Rescue operations and investigations are ongoing.China Taiping underwrote third-party liability and employee compensation for mandatory building and window inspection work at the complex, Bloomberg reported.The HK$316 million (US$41 million) project, which used bamboo scaffolding and protective netting, is now part of an ongoing investigation into the cause of the disaster.The insurer’s policy covers the full contract sum plus an additional HK$50 million (US$6.4 million) for accidents, and provides HK$200 million in employee compensation. Separately, the company holds a general property-all-risk policy worth HK$2 billion.According to Bloomberg, Hong Kong Insurance Professionals Federation chairman Philip Mak said both the general all-risk policy and the construction-specific coverage are “seriously underinsured” given the scale of the multi-tower estate.Mak noted that rebuilding communal areas and replacing elevator steel cables will likely exceed the insured amounts. Individual flat owners may claim death or injury benefits under the HK$50 million accident portion, but he warned the sum is “nowhere near enough” in light of the number of deaths and the hundreds still unaccounted for.",China Taiping Insurance Holdings Co. shares fell sharply on Thursday amid concerns over its exposure to a Hong Kong construction project.

The factors influencing turkey prices this Thanksgiving

Grocery stores in the US are absorbing the rising cost of turkeys this Thanksgiving. A spike in bird flu cases has pushed up wholesale prices, according to new data from the US department of agriculture (USDA). But these higher costs are not being passed on to shoppers.USDA figures show that advertised turkey prices in supermarkets are roughly the same as last year. Experts say stores are taking the hit to keep customers coming in, reported NBC News. Even the projected cost of a full Thanksgiving meal has stayed broadly steady.The main reason for the higher costs is a drop in supply. Bird flu has spread again among commercial poultry farms this autumn. By October, more than 2 million turkeys had been culled after exposure. Minnesota, the largest turkey-producing state, reported six confirmed outbreaks that month.David Ortega, a food economist at Michigan State University, told NBC, another virus avian metapneumovirus is also affecting production by reducing the number of viable eggs laid by hens. This has slowed farmers’ efforts to rebuild their flocks.Overall, turkey supply is tightening. The USDA expects production to fall to 4.8 million pounds this year, down from 5.1 million pounds in 2024.This shortage has pushed up costs for retailers. USDA data shows the wholesale price of frozen turkeys, the type most families buy for Thanksgiving, has jumped by about 80% since last year, rising from under $1 per pound to more than $1.70.A separate USDA report shows retail prices for frozen turkeys staying flat. Ortega said shops may be absorbing these increases to stop customers from switching stores. Retailers often use turkeys as a “loss leader”, selling them at or below cost to draw in shoppers and make up the difference through other items in their baskets.While turkey prices have stayed stable for shoppers, the overall cost of a Thanksgiving meal varies depending on the data source. Some estimates show prices rising by nearly 10%, while others show a fall of up to 5%.",USDA figures show that advertised turkey prices in supermarkets are roughly the same as last year.

'There is a Cisco': Why 'Big Short' investor Michael Burry is betting against Nvidia and Palantir,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/there-is-a-cisco-why-big-short-investor-michael-burry-is-betting-against-nvidia-and-palantir/articleshow/125592596.cms,"Why it matters



Zoom in: Burry’s beef isn’t with Nvidia’s books-but its customers’



The big picture: A new bubble with a familiar face



What they're saying: Nvidia responds, Burry doubles down



What’s next



Michael Burry, the investor famed for betting against the US housing market in “The Big Short,” is now shorting Nvidia and Palantir-two flagbearers of the AI rally. In a blistering Substack post, Burry dismissed Nvidia’s internal memo rebutting his concerns as “disingenuous on the face, and disappointing. ”He accused the world’s most valuable company of deflecting criticism with “one straw man after another,” charging that Nvidia’s response failed to engage with his actual concerns around depreciation assumptions in the AI ecosystem. The fresh attack comes as investors increasingly debate whether the AI boom has tipped into bubble territory, a Business Insider report said.The criticism comes at a critical moment: Nvidia stock has dropped 14% from its early-November peak, and broader questions are emerging over whether AI’s gold rush has entered speculative territory.Burry’s remarks tap into mounting investor unease-not about innovation, but about how profits are being propped up by accounting choices that may not age well as chip cycles shorten.Burry clarified that he never accused Nvidia of stretching out the depreciation of its own factories or equipment. “No one cares about Nvidia’s own depreciation,” he wrote. “One straw man burnt.”Instead, he zeroed in on cloud giants-Microsoft, Meta, Oracle-who are reportedly extending chip and server depreciation timelines from 3 years to 5 or 6.That, Burry says, lets them spread massive AI hardware costs over longer periods, inflating earnings now while kicking losses down the road.He cited a Microsoft interview in which Satya Nadella said the company slowed data center buildouts to avoid overbuilding for one generation of AI chips-a move Burry sees as confirmation that tech’s depreciation timelines may be out of sync with reality.“The hyperscalers have been systematically increasing the useful lives of chips and servers, for depreciation purposes,” Burry warned.Burry says today’s AI surge echoes the dot-com bubble-just with faster hardware, loftier assumptions, and bigger accounting risks. He compared Nvidia to Cisco circa 2000, the centerpiece of tech euphoria before the crash.“There is a Cisco at the center of it all,” he wrote. “Its name is Nvidia.”In a particularly stark forecast, Burry predicted tech companies could understate depreciation by $176 billion between 2026 and 2028, warning that Meta, Oracle and others could overstate earnings by 20–27% if timelines aren't adjusted.Nvidia disputed Burry’s math, especially around its stock buybacks. The company clarified that it has repurchased $91 billion in shares since 2018-not $112.5 billion as Burry implied-and said he mistakenly included RSU-related taxes.Nvidia also defended its GPU longevity, arguing chips like the A100 (released in 2020) are still in full use, justifying longer depreciation periods.Burry remains unmoved. “I stand by my analysis,” he posted on X. “Obviously, the full analysis does not fit in a tweet.”Burry disclosed he still holds put options on both Nvidia and Palantir, despite the market’s growing appetite for all things AI. He claimed they cost about $10 million each-not the $1.1 billion their notional value implied.He’s now using his new paywalled newsletter, “Cassandra Unchained,” to argue that this AI cycle isn’t just about tech-it’s also about the accounting scaffolding propping it up.“I have been drawn into something much bigger than me,” he wrote.If he’s right again, this won’t be the last straw man he sets alight.(With inputs from agencies)","Michael Burry, the investor famed for betting against the US housing market in ‘The Big Short,’ is now shorting Nvidia and Palantir.

Explained: How China gained rare earths dominance — and what it means for the US,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/explained-how-china-gained-rare-earths-dominance-and-what-it-means-for-the-us/articleshow/125588339.cms,"AI image

US Turns to India to Curb China’s Rare Earth Grip, Global Alliance to Counter Beijing’s Moves

Why the US fell behind





America and allies search for alternatives





China’s control over rare earth elements did not happen overnight. It is the result of decades of investment across every stage of the chain — from mining and reserves to processing and technology — giving Beijing significant influence in its trade dispute with Washington.These 17 minerals are essential for defence equipment such as fighter jets, radar systems and missile guidance, and are also used in smartphones, medical tools and cars.According to news agency AFP reporters who visited Ganzhou this month, found the heavy rare earths region buzzing with activity despite tight surveillance.The area produces elements like yttrium and terbium, and the agency reporters witnessed trucks moving in and out of mines and busy processing plants.The city is also constructing new headquarters for China Rare Earth Group, one of two major state-owned players formed after years of government-led consolidation.Economics lecturer Heron Lim told AFP that recent disruptions have encouraged more countries to consider expanding their own production, adding that such moves “could pay longer-term dividends.”Trade tensions push rare earths to centre stageChina’s export restrictions announced in early October shook global manufacturers and alarmed Washington, which is locked in a renewed trade war with Beijing under President Donald Trump’s second term.After talks in South Korea, Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed to a one-year truce that temporarily secures supplies of rare earths and other minerals — a development widely viewed as favourable to Beijing.Lim said rare earths would likely remain central to future negotiations, noting that China has shown it is prepared to use trade tools to keep the US engaged. He added that the uncertainty has created difficulties for industries dependent on these metals.During the Cold War, the United States led the rare earths industry, with the Mountain Pass mine in California supplying much of the world.But as relations with Moscow improved and environmental concerns grew, the US shifted production overseas through the 1980s and 1990s.China now accounts for about two-thirds of global mining and roughly 90% of processing, according to analysis cited by AFP. It also holds the world’s largest reserves and leads in patents, supported by strict export controls on processing technology.Commodities analyst Amelia Haines was quoted by AFP as saying that the heavy reliance on imports poses “significant risks to critical industries,” which could accelerate a broader push for mineral security.The US has been attempting for years to rebuild its rare earths capacity. Defence agencies have invested heavily to establish a full “mine-to-magnet” chain by 2027.Washington has also signed critical minerals agreements with allies including Australia, Japan, Malaysia and Thailand.Trump recently announced an $8.5 billion rare earths partnership with Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese.This urgency is not new. In 2010, China briefly halted rare earth shipments to Japan during a territorial dispute, highlighting the geopolitical stakes.The Obama administration called for strengthening US resilience, yet 15 years on, China remains the dominant force in the sector.",China's control over rare earth elements did not happen overnight.

Budget leak shock: UK's Treasury chief Reeves unveils tax plan in Parliament; Labour braces for political fallout,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/budget-leak-shock-uks-treasury-chief-reeves-unveils-tax-plan-in-parliament-labour-braces-for-political-fallout/articleshow/125590941.cms,"Britain’s Treasury chief Rachel Reeves delivered her tax-raising budget on Wednesday under the shadow of a major leak that exposed her proposals hours before she reached Parliament. The disclosure came from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), which Reeves relies on for independent forecasts. According to AP, the leak effectively mapped out the entire fiscal package.The OBR said a “technical error” caused the documents to go live early on its website and apologised for the breach, adding that it would report the lapse to all relevant authorities, including the Treasury. AP reported that the biggest revenue measure is a freeze on tax thresholds that will push more earners into higher bands as wages rise.Other announcements flagged in the leaked papers include a mansion tax on high-value properties, changes to the capital tax regime and a reduction in tax-free allowances for private pensions. The documents estimate that the government will raise 26 billion pounds ($34 billion) in 2029–30.The episode has embarrassed the Labour government, which has already been grappling with weeks of speculation and mixed signals that unsettled financial markets.This is Reeves’ second budget since Labour’s landslide return to power in July 2024.Reeves repeated that her overall message remains unchanged from her first budget, when she said there would be only one major tax-raising exercise this parliamentary term, which runs to 2029. But the UK economy has struggled to match her expectations, with critics pointing to last year’s business tax increases as a drag.Although Britain briefly led the G7 in growth during the first half of the year, momentum faded again. “The chancellor faces a delicate balancing act of conveying fiscal stability while advancing the growth agenda,” said Peter Arnold, chief economist at EY UKBritain’s long struggle to recover from the 2008–09 financial crisis continues to weigh on tax revenues. Those pressures have been compounded by the economic costs of the pandemic, the Russia–Ukraine war and US President Donald Trump’s global tariffs, with Brexit adding additional strain since 2020.Reeves also faces a raft of spending promises aimed at easing the cost of living as inflation remains elevated. Measures include reversing planned welfare cuts, reviewing the cap on benefits for larger families and offering relief through frozen rail fares or lower green taxes on energy bills.The political stakes are high for Reeves and Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who is battling concern within Labour over his poor poll numbers. Surveys consistently place Labour behind Nigel Farage’s Reform UK. With an election not required until 2029, the government is banking on stronger growth to improve its standing, but analysts warn that a misjudged budget could deepen the sense of crisis around Starmer’s leadership.","Treasury chief Rachel Reeves delivered her tax-raising budget on Wednesday under the shadow of a major leak.

Inflation? Why Thanksgiving is cheaper this year (and what that says about the economy),https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/inflation-why-thanksgiving-is-cheaper-this-year-and-what-that-says-about-the-economy/articleshow/125590223.cms,"The turkey got cheaper, not the world



Retailers are buying your gratitude



The feast is cheaper, the sides are sulking



Farmers were not invited to this celebration



Politics of the poultry index



The Costco shortcut and the new definition of convenience



what dishes count as “standard”,

how many portions they define as “normal”,

what ingredients get included or excluded,

how much profit margin they can hide in the bundle.

Cheap thanks, expensive future



Retailers are deliberately discounting turkey as a loss leader to attract shoppers.

Wholesale costs have not collapsed, meaning the discount is a financed illusion.

Some key food categories — especially grains — have cooled, reducing the cost of specific items.

Other categories — vegetables, fruits, beverages — remain expensive.

Consumers have traded down to store brands, frozen pies and smaller menus.

Farmers are facing higher costs and lower margins.

Inflation is slowing, not reversing.

Politicians are selling a narrative more than a macroeconomic reality.

For a country that once launched a revolution over the price of tea, America gets remarkably sentimental about the cost of turkey. Every November, economists, politicians and supermarket executives gather around a metaphorical table to debate the national poultry index, as if the fate of the republic depends on whether a 16-pound bird costs twenty dollars or twenty-five.This year, for the first time in a while, that conversation contains a four-letter word that Americans haven’t heard in a long time: down. The Thanksgiving dinner is officially cheaper. But the story of why it is cheaper is far more interesting than the number itself. It’s a tale of retail psychology, farmer misery, supply chain politics, and the great American tradition of pretending a discount is the same thing as prosperity.Let’s begin with the headline. The average cost of the classic Thanksgiving dinner for ten has dipped a few percentage points. The centrepiece of this softened inflation narrative is the turkey. A standard bird is significantly cheaper this year — the sharpest drop in years — and it has lowered the overall cost of the meal.But here’s the real twist: the world around that turkey is still expensive. Food-at-home prices remain elevated compared to pre-pandemic levels.Everyday staples like cereals, fresh vegetables, condiments and beverages are still inching upward. Grocery bills are not collapsing. They are simply not rising as brutally as they did in 2022 and 2023.Think of Thanksgiving as the supermarket’s Bollywood song-and-dance sequence. Eighty per cent of the movie is gritty realism. But for five minutes, everyone forgets their troubles and celebrates because the turkey looks cheap.Why is the turkey cheap if the world is not? Simple. Retailers are taking the hit.In the supermarket playbook, the Thanksgiving turkey is the emotional equivalent of “free delivery”. It’s a loss leader — the product a store sells at or below cost to drag you inside and make sure you buy everything else at full price.Grocery giants know that Americans treat Thanksgiving like a ritual. You must buy the turkey. You must buy the sides. You must buy the extras. The only question is where. And that is where the retail war begins.Several major chains are deliberately discounting turkeys even though their own acquisition costs have gone up. Wholesale prices have risen due to disease outbreaks in turkey flocks and feed costs that haven’t come down nearly enough. But supermarkets are absorbing that pain because the turkey discount is an unbeatable form of customer acquisition.Tech companies give free trials. Supermarkets sacrifice poultry margins.And as every business student learns on day one: customer eyeballs today are worth more than profit margins this week.This “cheaper Thanksgiving” narrative also depends heavily on what you choose to count.Turkey and wheat-based products — bread, buns, pie crusts — have become cheaper thanks to slightly better global crop cycles and softer consumer demand. Frozen items, store brands and bulk packs have also become more popular, forcing retailers to compete on price.But vegetables? Those are having an existential crisis. Weather disruptions in key growing regions have hit sweet potatoes and green beans. Basic vegetable trays have shot up in price in many parts of the country. Fresh fruit is pricier thanks to transportation and import pressures. Canned goods, especially those dependent on metal and packaging costs, are not giving any Thanksgiving discounts.So yes, the meal looks cheaper. But it is the turkey that is doing the heavy lifting while half the sides are quietly sulking in the corner, waiting for someone to notice their suffering.If there is one group that does not feel thankful this year, it is the American farming community.Consumers see the downturn in the cost of the Thanksgiving basket. Farmers see a very different ledger. Crop prices for some staples have declined, but their input costs haven’t. Fertiliser, fuel, machinery and labour remain stubbornly high. Weather shocks — drought, heat waves, erratic rains — continue to disrupt yields unpredictably.Turkey farmers, in particular, have been hammered. Outbreaks of avian flu have led to culling entire flocks after a single infection. One diseased bird means a financial disaster for a farmer who spent months raising hundreds. Retailers can afford to discount a turkey. Farmers cannot afford to lose one.The Thanksgiving discount that consumers are celebrating is made possible partly because someone else is swallowing pain higher up the supply chain.This is not a moral argument. It is a business one. Retailers compress margins aggressively. Farmers have no margins left to compress. Inflation did not leave. It simply dressed up as generosity. This is the part where inflation performs one of its favourite magic tricks: anchoring.After years of high inflation, consumers have adjusted their expectations upwards. So when a $64 Thanksgiving meal becomes a $55 meal, it feels like a relief — even if the same dinner cost far less just a few years ago. This is not victory. It is relief masquerading as recovery.And retailers exploit this psychology brilliantly. A sharply discounted, culturally significant product creates a narrative of “things are finally getting better”. Meanwhile, dozens of other items around the store have quietly gone up by 2 to 10 percent. You notice the cheap turkey. You do not notice the expensive soda, the quietly inflated butter, or the premium packaging costs.In business terms, the turkey is the shiny notification. Everything else is the terms and conditions.Any national holiday with food and numbers will inevitably be hijacked by politics. Thanksgiving is no exception.Cheap turkey prices become evidence of economic competency. Expensive turkey prices become evidence of national collapse. Every White House, regardless of party, loves claiming credit for a “cheaper Thanksgiving”, even when the primary drivers are retail strategy, not government policy.This year, politicians have repeated the line that the Thanksgiving meal is significantly cheaper. They highlight the change from last year. They do not highlight the change from 2018 or 2015, because that comparison is far less flattering.The turkey aisle becomes a political prop. The optics serve everyone. Retailers get attention. Politicians get talking points. Consumers get the illusion of victory.Everyone wins the narrative. No one wins the economics.There’s another emerging trend: the pre-assembled Thanksgiving meal. Big box retailers now offer complete kits that feed families for less than the average DIY cost.On the surface, this looks like efficiency and savings. Underneath, it is something else entirely.When you outsource your Thanksgiving meal to a corporation, the company gains power over:Software companies call this bundling. Economists call it controlling the supply chain. Grandma calls it “not my Thanksgiving”.Think of it as the Netflix-ification of holiday meals. A corporation decides the menu. You just show up and hit play.So why exactly is Thanksgiving cheaper this year?Let’s strip away the marketing and look at the mechanics:This year’s Thanksgiving is not proof that the economy is healed. It is proof that retailers are very good at narrative management. The Thanksgiving basket is a PR campaign wrapped in aluminium foil.It is also a case study in how the American consumer economy works. When inflation rages, retailers raise prices. When inflation softens, retailers lower selective prices and call it generosity. When the economy is jittery, the turkey becomes a bargaining chip in a much larger psychological war for customer loyalty.And here is the final irony.Americans will sit around their tables this November and give thanks for a slightly cheaper meal. But the price cut is not the result of a benevolent market, a miraculous supply chain recovery or a sudden burst of federal competence.It is the result of carefully calibrated retail economics. Someone decided that your gratitude was worth a discounted bird. Someone else — usually a farmer — paid for that gratitude out of their own margins. And the rest of the store quietly made back what the turkey lost.The turkey may be cheaper. The world around it is not. But in a year where everything feels a bit fragile, America will take the small win. Even if it is cooked, seasoned and packaged to perfection by the marketing department.",The average cost of the classic Thanksgiving dinner for ten has dipped a few percentage points. A standard bird is significantly cheaper this year — the sharpest drop in years. But here’s the real twist: the world around that turkey is still expensive.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125590328,imgsize-56612,width-400,resizemode-4/why-your-turkey-is-cheaper-this-year.jpg"

Xi Tells Trump 'TAIWAN MUST RETURN TO CHINA' As Tensions Over Japan PM Takaichi's Remarks Snowball

China has purchased at least 10 cargoes of US soybeans, worth around $300 million, in contracts signed since Tuesday, sources quoted by news agency Reuters claimed.The deals come a day after US President Donald Trump spoke with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping, signalling a thaw in trade relations between the two countries.Each cargo ranges between 60,000 and 65,000 metric tons, with shipments scheduled for January from Gulf Coast terminals and the Pacific Northwest.Trump, commenting on the renewed engagement, said he had urged Xi to accelerate and increase China’s purchases of American goods, adding that the Chinese leader had “more or less agreed,” reported Reuters.The purchases extend a surge in Chinese buying following late-October talks in South Korea and reflect efforts to stabilise bilateral dialogue on trade.Despite US soybeans being priced higher than Brazilian alternatives, China paid premiums of $2.3 per bushel over the January Chicago futures contract for Gulf shipments and $2.2 per bushel for Pacific Northwest cargoes, compared with around $1.8 per bushel for Brazilian supplies.Johnny Xiang, founder of Beijing-based AgRadar Consulting, was quoted by Reuters as saying, “Commercial buyers will continue to avoid US soybean imports, as prices remain higher than Brazilian beans.At these levels, crush margins are not financially viable.”State-run COFCO has led the recent buying spree, securing nearly 2 million tons of US soybeans since late October, as per Reuters.While these deals fall short of the 12 million tons previously announced by the White House, US treasury secretary Scott Bessent said the purchases are “right on schedule,” citing a broader agreement for China to buy 87.5 million tons of American soybeans over the next three-and-a-half years.Trump and Xi’s phone call on Monday addressed a wide range of issues, including trade, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, fentanyl controls, and agricultural products like soybeans.Trump expressed optimism about bilateral cooperation, saying, “I think we will be pleasantly surprised by the actions of President Xi. I have a great relationship with him. I like him. He likes me… He invited me to visit Beijing in April, which I accepted”.","China has purchased at least 10 cargoes of US soybeans, worth around $300 million, in contracts signed since Tuesday.

FULL: ‘AMERICANS, DON’T FORGET!’: Trump ROASTS Dems, ENDS Shutdown, Wants Filibuster Gone | Watch

The United States began the 2026 fiscal year with a $284 billion federal deficit in October, a figure shaped by record tariff revenue but also distorted by a major shift in benefit payments and delays caused by a 43-day federal shutdown.The Treasury said the shutdown postponed some agency spending, including pay for federal employees, though the impact on total outlays was estimated at under 5%.The deficit was 10% higher than the $257 billion shortfall recorded a year earlier, largely because roughly $105 billion in November benefits for certain military and healthcare programmes were pulled into October, as per Reuters.Without that shift, the monthly deficit would have been about $180 billion — a 29% drop from an adjusted October 2024 figure of $252 billion.Total outlays reached $689 billion — up 18% from last year — boosted by the reclassified benefit payments, reported Reuters.Some departments, however, showed lower spending, reflecting the delay in passing annual appropriations until 12 November, as per Bloomberg.Meanwhile, interest costs on federal debt climbed to $104 billion, a 27% increase from a year earlier, due to a higher debt load and a 3.36% average rate.October receipts hit a record $404 billion, up 24% from last year, supported by customs duties, as per Reuters.Tariff revenues surged to an unprecedented $31.4 billion after new import duties imposed by President Donald Trump since returning to office, eclipsing September’s previous record.Customs duties had averaged about $29 billion over the prior three months. Trump said tariff collections would “skyrocket” as firms depleted pre-tariff inventories. In a message targeting the Supreme Court, which has questioned the legality of some emergency-based tariffs, he wrote, “I look so much forward to the United States Supreme Court’s decision… so that we can continue… to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!”However, the Congressional Budget Office recently cut its estimate of how much Trump’s tariffs would reduce deficits over the next decade, lowering the projection from $4 trillion to $3 trillion due to tariff rollbacks from recent trade deals.Other revenue gains came from an $80 billion surge in non-withheld individual tax payments, up 75% from last year, mainly because California wildfire victims were allowed to delay filing until 15 October.Withheld taxes rose 6% to $279 billion, but corporate tax receipts were flat at $18 billion, which the Treasury attributed to tax breaks in a Republican-backed bill enacted this year.According to Bloomberg, treasury secretary Scott Bessent expects tariff revenue to accelerate and has suggested collections could reach $500 billion annually, though the pending Supreme Court case and Trump’s proposal to pay tariff “dividends” to citizens could complicate borrowing needs.Non-discretionary spending — including Social Security, healthcare and interest — continued to push deficits upward.Record tariff income last year offset only part of the 2025 deficit, which totalled $1.78 trillion, as per Bloomberg.Bessent has highlighted the drop in the deficit-to-GDP ratio from 6.4% to 5.9% as evidence of progress, saying he aims to bring it “to something with a three in front of it” by the end of Trump’s term.",The United States began the 2026 fiscal year with a $284 billion federal deficit in October. The deficit was 10% higher than the $257 billion shortfall recorded a year earlier. The figure was shaped by record tariff revenue but also distorted by a major shift in benefit payments and delays caused by a 43-day federal shutdown.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125583032,imgsize-1278315,width-400,resizemode-4/untitled-design-71.jpg"
UK wage rise: Minimum pay raised for 2.7 million workers from April; businesses warn of higher cost pressures,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/uk-wage-rise-minimum-pay-raised-for-2-7-million-workers-from-april-businesses-warn-of-higher-cost-pressures/articleshow/125581745.cms,"File photo: Chancellor Rachel Reeves (Picture credit: AP)

Millions of low-paid workers in the UK will receive a pay increase from April as the government confirmed new minimum wage rates ahead of Wednesday’s Budget.The hourly rate for over-21s will rise by 50p to £12.71, with 18–20-year-olds seeing an 85p jump to £10.85, and under-18s and apprentices receiving £8 an hour after a 45p increase.Chancellor Rachel Reeves said 2.7 million people will benefit from the changes.The rise follows last year’s 6.7% increase for over-21s and 16.3% for 18–20-year-olds, when employers also faced higher National Insurance contributions, reported BBC.Reeves said the cost of living remained the biggest issue for working people and that “the economy isn’t working well enough for those on the lowest incomes”.She added that the increases ensured workers were “properly rewarded” for their labour, a point also emphasised by the government in, as per The Guardian.However, businesses warned of pressure on hiring and prices. UK Hospitality chair Kate Nicholls said firms had “reached their limit of absorbing seemingly endless additional costs” and would have to pass them on to consumers, fuelling inflation.The British Chambers of Commerce said every above-inflation rise added to business strain, with deputy public policy director Jane Gratton noting, ‘There's a limit to how much additional cost employers can bear without something having to give’, as per BBC.The Treasury said the new minimum wage rates for 2026 struck a balance among worker needs, business affordability and employment opportunities.However, steep pay rises could hinder job prospects for young people.The Resolution Foundation warned the increase for 18–20-year-olds was “unnecessarily big” and risked pushing up NEET (not in education, employment or training) rates.Still, the Low Pay Commission maintained previous rises “have not had a significant negative impact on jobs,” as per BBC.Commission chair Philippa Stroud said the body had weighed cost-of-living pressures against employer challenges and observed that “no one is having an easy time”.The government also confirmed additional measures, including extending the sugar tax to milk-based drinks, expanding the Help to Save scheme and giving English regional mayors powers to impose a tourist tax.","2.7 million low-paid workers in the UK will receive a pay increase from April. hourly rate for over-21s will rise by 50p to £12.71. 18–20-year-olds will see an 85p jump to £10.85, and under-18s and apprentices £8 an hour.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125581848,imgsize-771627,width-400,resizemode-4/untitled-design-70.jpg"
1.14 lakh startups generate more than 12 lakh jobs in India: Finance ministry,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/trend-tracking/1-14-lakh-startups-generate-more-than-12-lakh-jobs-in-india-finance-ministry/articleshow/107262154.cms,"Finance Ministry

NEW DELHI: More than 1.14 lakh startups in India have created over 12 lakh jobs so far, the finance ministry said in its latest review of the Indian economy.In the report titled, ‘The Indian Economy: A Review January 2024’, the Department of Economic Affairs said that the 1.14 lakh startups recognised by the government under the 'Startup India initiative’ created more than 12 lakh jobs (as of October 2023).The state-owned e-commerce platform Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) clocked more than 63 lakh transactions till November 2023, the document read.Despite facing global challenges in 2023 like valuation issues, few IPOs, regulatory changes and macroeconomic and geopolitical trends, India remains the third largest tech start-up ecosystem globally, with over 950 tech startups founded last year.The cumulative funding for more than 31,000 tech start ups has exceeded $70 billion (from 2019 to 2023), according to a recent report by Nasscom in collaboration with Zinnov.“In 2023, despite facing global economic and regulatory challenges, Indian tech startups have prioritised the imperative of enhancing their business fundamentals, driving profitability and growth,” said Debjani Ghosh, President, Nasscom.“The proliferation of tech startups in tier 2 and 3 cities marks the ecosystem's resilience,” she added.Navigating 2024, tech startup founders expect to continue the revenue growth path with measured steps focusing on optimising expenditure and maximising profitability for B2B tech startups.Investments in deeptech will continue an upward trend in 2024. With generative AI (GenAI) acceleration, 70 per cent of start-up founders are embedding artificial intelligence (AI) in their solutions.As funding becomes scarce for the Indian startup ecosystem in general, the explosion of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has given a new lease of life to entrepreneurs and founders in the country, as the Centre extends support to the sector.","The state-owned e-commerce platform Open Network for Digital Commerce clocked more than 63 lakh transactions till November 2023.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

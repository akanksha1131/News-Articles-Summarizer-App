Gold and silver price prediction today:MCX Gold prices have been gradually inching higher, reflecting a strong underlying bullish momentum. The precious metal is likely to test the 102,450 level in the near term as the broader bias continues to remain firmly positive. On the downside, the immediate and crucial support is placed at 99,900 levels, which acts as a safety net for traders. As long as prices sustain above this support zone, the upward trajectory is expected to continue.The bullish sentiment in gold is supported by both technical and fundamental factors. From a technical standpoint, higher highs and higher lows on the chart indicate that buying interest is intact. On the fundamental side, global uncertainties, fluctuations in the U.S. dollar, and expectations around central bank policies are providing additional strength to bullion prices. Demand for gold as a safe-haven asset remains elevated, keeping investor interest strong.In the short term, any dip towards 100,200–100,000 levels is likely to attract fresh buying, while a decisive move above 102,450 may open the doors for further gains. Overall, the outlook remains constructive, and traders should maintain a positive bias as long as 99,900 holds as strong support.MCX Silver is currently trading around the 115,500 mark and continues to show strength, with the potential to extend its rally towards 117,500 levels in the near term, followed by 118,000 levels if momentum sustains. The bias remains constructive as long as the metal holds firmly above its key support placed at 113,000 levels. This support zone has been tested earlier and has provided a strong base for buyers to re-enter the market.Technically, silver has been forming higher highs and higher lows, indicating that the uptrend is intact. A sustained move above 116,200 could further fuel bullish momentum, bringing the next resistance zones of 117,500 and 118,000 into play. On the other hand, any dips towards 114,000–113,500 are expected to attract fresh buying interest, as long as 113,000 support holds strong.On the fundamental side, silver’s outlook is supported by its dual nature as both a precious and industrial metal. Rising investment demand, coupled with optimism in the renewable energy and electronics sectors where silver is heavily used, adds to its positive sentiment. Additionally, global economic cues, movement in the U.S. dollar, and policy expectations from major central banks remain influential drivers.","Gold prices are likely to continue their bullish trend in the near term, says Abhilash Koikkara, Head - Forex & Commodities, Nuvama Professional Clients Group.

Big Hint By Ruling Party MP & Ex-Diplomat Amid Tariff Escalation

NEW DELHI: The finance ministry on Wednesday cautioned that while the immediate impact of US tariffs on Indian exports may be limited, their secondary and long-term effects could pose significant challenges.The remarks come as Washington’s 50% duties on Indian goods took effect from August 27, covering exports worth over $48 billion.The ministry’s monthly economic review stressed that ongoing India-US trade negotiations will be crucial in mitigating the fallout.""While the immediate impact of recent US tariffs on Indian exports may appear limited, their secondary and tertiary effects on the economy pose challenges that must be addressed. In this context, the ongoing India-US trade negotiations will be crucial,"" it said.Key sectors facing the brunt include textiles, gems and jewellery, shrimp, leather, chemicals, and machinery, though pharmaceuticals and energy products remain unaffected.India is simultaneously pushing for diversified trade partnerships, with recent FTAs signed with the UK and EFTA, and negotiations under way with the US, EU, New Zealand, Chile, and Peru.However, the report noted that these initiatives will take time and may not fully offset export losses if tariffs remain.""This includes the recently concluded FTA with the UK and EFTA and ongoing FTA negotiations with the US, EU, New Zealand, Chile, and Peru. But, these initiatives will take time to show results and may not fully address the shortfall in exports to the US that may arise if the current tariff rates on India persist,"" it said.The review also highlighted India’s upgraded sovereign rating by S&P from 'BBB-' to 'BBB', reflecting strong growth, stable policies, and high infrastructure investment. Domestically, better monsoon rains and improved crop prospects are expected to keep inflation moderate in the near term.""An increased market arrival in Q1, comfortable buffer stocks and better output prospects, coupled with stable global oil markets, might keep the prices of food grain moderate. The downside risks to global growth are likely to keep international commodity prices in check, partly offsetting the impact of higher tariffs,"" it noted.To further enhance the economic growth Prime Minister has announced a few initiatives focusing on policy reforms.The government announced a Task Force for Next-Generation Reforms, a planned rollout of GST changes to ease the tax burden, and schemes like PM Viksit Bharat Rozgar Yojana to boost jobs and skill development.Together, these measures aim to strengthen growth, attract investment, and sustain economic resilience amid global uncertainties.","The finance ministry cautioned that while the immediate impact of US tariffs on Indian exports may be limited, their secondary and long-term effects could pose significant challenges.

Stock market recommendations:Benchmark Indices witnessed sharp decline during last week, with Nifty closing the August month expiry around 24,500 levels. Investors are closely tracking the government’s fiscal and policy interventions, with emphasis on potential GST rationalization and sectoral stimulus packages aimed at alleviating tariff-induced headwinds and reinforcing the broader growth trajectory. US has enforced a steep 50% tariff on Indian imports from August 27, 2025, India stands at a pivotal juncture, testing both its economic resilience and diplomatic agility.Going ahead to pause the current down move index needs to close above previous sessions high, failing to do so will keep the bias down.Nifty has an immediate support base placed at 24,400-24,350 levels being the confluence of the recent lows and the key retracement area. Index holding above the same will lead to a consolidation in the range of 24,400-24,900. While failure to do so will signal acceleration of decline towards 24,000-23,800 levels being the confluence of the 52 weeks EMA and the previous major lows and the previous major breakout area.On the higher side resistance is seen around 24,900 levels. Only a move above the same will signal a pause in the downtrend. While a move above 24,900 will extend pullback towards the major resistance area of 25150-25,250 levels being the confluence of the 61.8% retracement of the entire decline and the previous swing high.We expect volatility to pick up tracking tariff development and GDP numbers. Hence, focus should be on accumulating quality stocks backed by strong earnings, especially those poised to benefit from next-generation GST reforms and upcoming festive season.Bank Nifty formed a sizable bear candle with a lower high and lower low signaling continuation of the corrective decline as the index closed below the 100 days EMA. Index in the process closed below the last 3 weeks range (54,900-56,100) highlighting extension of the decline.Going ahead, failure to move above 55,000 will keep the bias down and will open downside towards 53,500- 53,000 levels in the coming sessions.Key support is placed at 53,000 levels being the confluence of the 200 days EMA and the low of May 2025.The stock has recently generated a breakout above the consolidation range (210-165) with strong volume signaling resumption of up move and higher participation at the breakout area thus offering fresh entry opportunity.We expect the stock to extend up move and head towards 257 levels in the coming months being the measuring implication of the range breakout.The weekly stochastic remains in a strong up trend forming higher high and higher low thus supports the positive bias in the stock.The stock has recently generated a breakout above the bullish rounding formation signaling continuation of the up trend and offers fresh entry opportunity.The stock has outperformed the overall market and is likely to extend its current outperformance.We expect the stock to head towards 270 levels in the coming months being the measuring implication of the rounding formation. Weekly MACD remains in a strong up trend thus supports the positive bias.","According to Bajaj Broking Research, Godawari Power and Ispat Limited and Apollo Micro Systems are the top stock picks for today.

Donald Trump’s 50% Tariffs Leave India’s Export Sectors Reeling: Who Gets Hit, Who Escapes

Trade levy review

US tariffs : RBI signals readiness to step in

With Donald Trump’s 50% tariffs coming into effect, the Reserve Bank of India RBI ) is set to convene discussions with business stakeholders to evaluate the impact across various sectors. These consultations are scheduled for September, ahead of the next review by the monetary policy committee.Industry exporters have requested various relief measures, including a one-year interest payment suspension on principal, automatic 30% increase in bank limits, lending without collateral, and interest equalisation for MSMEs to address the current difficulties.The timing of this meeting is crucial, as new punitive tariffs imposed on India are now active, with potential implications for 55% of the annual $48-billion exports to the US. The sectors expected to face significant challenges from these tariffs include labour-intensive industries such as textiles and apparel, gems and jewellery, and marine products.The unprecedented high tariffs would expose Indian exports to the US to a competitive disadvantage of 30-35%, reducing India's market position compared to similar products from China, Vietnam, Cambodia, the Philippines and other Southeast and South Asian nations.""A consultation is being planned in the wake of an uncertain international economic environment due to tariffs and trade policies,"" an official aware of the details told ET.Officials from RBI and industry leaders plan to hold discussions regarding the India-UK Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA), according to the mentioned official.

""RBI has always been very proactive in whatever needs to be done for the betterment, advancement and growth of our country,"" Malhotra stated at the event.He noted that whilst 45% of merchandise exports remain unaffected by the tariff structure, certain sectors including gems and jewellery, textiles, shrimp cultivation and MSMEs could face adverse impacts.""This stakeholder consultation is important as the impact of the US tariffs is becoming visible on clusters such as Surat, Kanpur and Tiruppur, with fewer shifts at work,"" said Anil Bhardwaj, Secretary General, Federation of Indian Micro Small & Medium Enterprises. ""MSMEs need credit support to sustain working capital and liquidity. Else, the situation may worsen by Diwali,” he told ET.The textile sector, which exported $6-7 billion worth of apparel to the US in FY25, traditionally received 70% of orders during July-September.""However, this year, US market orders for spring and summer have almost reduced to a nought after America decided to slap 50% tariffs on Indian imports,"" said Animesh Saxena, general secretary, Garment Exporters &Manufacturers Association.The MSME sector is now anticipating relief through the India-UK CETA, pending ratification.

"Tariffs pose risks, growth on track: RBI",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/tariffs-pose-risks-growth-on-track-rbi/articleshow/123574677.cms,".

Mumbai: RBI has said that persisting uncertainties related to India-US trade policies continue to pose downside risk while inflation outlook for the near term has become more benign than anticipated earlier.The central bank's 'state of the economy' report has, however, maintained confidence in India's growth outlook and not lowered the estimate of 6.5% announced in the Aug policy. Citing the IMF, the report said risks to global growth were tilted to the downside despite an upward revision in projections. This uncertainty, it added, continued to pose a downside risk to India's domestic outlook.Industrial activity remained subdued, dragged down by mining and electricity. At the same time, the manufacturing sector expanded and services sustained their growth momentum. India's merchandise trade deficit widened to $27.3 billion in July 2025 from $24.8 billion a year earlier, mainly due to higher oil imports.Resource flows to the commercial sector increased, with large corporates increasingly meeting funding needs through market-based instruments such as commercial paper and corporate bonds.Domestic equity markets, the RBI said, were weighed down by weak corporate earnings and the US decision to impose higher import tariffs on Indian goods in July and early Aug. Foreign portfolio investors turned net sellers in both months, reversing two months of inflows, as equity outflows intensified amid global trade tensions and risk-off sentiment. ""Steady inflows from domestic institutional investors, notably mutual funds, helped cushion the impact from net selling by foreign portfolio investors,"" the report added.The central bank also highlighted the significance of India's recent sovereign rating upgrade by S&P. ""The S&P's sovereign rating upgrade for India underpinned by buoyant economic growth, enhanced monetary policy credibility and government's commitment to fiscal consolidation could potentially lead to a reduction in borrowing costs, greater investor confidence and higher foreign capital inflows, going forward,"" it said.","The central bank's'state of the economy' report has, however, maintained confidence in India's growth outlook.

Head Digital Works, which operates the gaming platform A23, filed the petition opposing several provisions of the Act, passed by Parliament during the monsoon session.The plea stated the new law attempts to blur the distinction between games of skill and chance in defining 'online money game'.The company claimed that this disregard for established jurisprudence exceeds Parliament's legislative competence and constitutes arbitrary action. Additionally, the petition deemed the definition to be overbroad, encompassing all online games involving monetary stakes.While prohibiting the offering of online money games and related services, the Act also bans advertising related to such games, infringing on the right to free speech and the right to promote legitimate business, the petition stated.Senior counsel Aryama Sundaram and Dhyan Chinnappa mentioned the filing before Justice BM Shyam Prasad on Thursday, who indicated that the matter would be taken up on Saturday. The petition also argued that the Act represents a sudden policy reversal for the gaming sector, particularly as the Union govt recently recognised online gaming as part of the digital economy.

According to government data cited by AP, hiring has slowed significantly since spring. Job gains averaged at 35,000 a month in the three months to July, less than a quarter of last year’s pace.Unemployment benefit claims are a key proxy for layoffs and have mostly stayed in the range of 200,000 to 250,000 since the country emerged from the COVID-19 pandemic more than three years ago.Despite the low level of layoffs, hiring has weakened, a trend many economists now call a “no hire, no fire” economy. The unemployment rate remains at a relatively low 4.2%.Economic growth has also cooled this year, with businesses holding back on expansion plans amid uncertainty over President Donald Trump’s tariff policies. The economy grew at just a 1.3% annual rate in the first half of 2025, down from 2.5% in 2024, AP reported.The slowdown has increased expectations that the Fed could cut interest rates at its next meeting on 16–17 September. Fed Chair Jerome Powell signalled last week that a reduction in the key rate may be on the cards, which could in turn lower costs for mortgages, car loans and business borrowing.The latest report also showed that the four-week average of claims, which smooths out fluctuations, rose by 2,500 to 228,500.The number of people continuing to receive unemployment benefits for the week ending August 16 slipped by 7,000 to 1.95 million. Though slightly lower, that figure is still close to a four-year high, pointing to the difficulties many jobseekers face in securing new work once unemployed.","Applications for jobless aid dropped by 5,000 to 229,000 for the week ending 23 August.

In the institution’s 112 years, no US president has ever attempted to fire a Fed governor, until Donald Trump published a letter on social media announcing that Cook had been removed.He stated that she was being fired because of allegations of mortgage fraud dating back to 2021, before she joined the board, AP reported.Most observing the matter expect the battle to end up before the Supreme Court . The Court has previously said the president cannot dismiss Fed officials over disagreements on policy, but can do so “for cause,” a term that usually covers misconduct or neglect of duty. Cook, however, has not been charged with any crime.Her lawsuit argues that the claims have nothing to do with her work at the Fed and remain unproven. It also argues she was not given a chance to respond before being targeted.""The unsubstantiated and unproven allegation that Governor Cook ‘potentially’ erred in filling out a mortgage form prior to her Senate confirmation—does not amount to 'cause,'"" the filing says, as cited by AP.“Allowing the President to remove members of the Board over policy disagreements would also render illusory the Board’s independence,” it continues.The move comes as Trump has stepped up attacks on Fed chair Jerome Powell and the central bank’s interest-rate committee for not lowering borrowing costs more quickly. However, Powell has already signalled another rate cut could be coming at the 16–17 September meeting.Cook’s suit suggests the allegations are just an excuse to get rid of her, “the mortgage allegations against her are pretextual, in order to effectuate her prompt removal and vacate a seat for President Trump to fill and forward his agenda to undermine the independence of the Federal Reserve.”As the Trump has previously said that he will only nominate people who back lower rates, the dismissal attempt paves the way for the White House to appoint a Trump loyalist, AP reported.The Fed is one of the most powerful institutions in the US economy, influencing the cost of mortgages, car loans and business borrowing by setting short-term interest rates.If the courts allow Trump’s firing of Cook to stand, analysts warn it could strip the Fed of its ability to act independently. That would make it harder for the bank to take unpopular steps, such as raising rates to control inflation.","Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook has taken the Trump administration to court after the US president tried to fire her.

Wall Street traded mix on Thursday as investors weighed stronger-than-expected US economic growth against record earnings from Nvidia, the American chipmaker at the centre of the artificial intelligence boom.The S&P 500 and Nasdaq both opened higher, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average traded in red.Nasdaq jumped 45 points or 0.21% to 21,635 and S&P 500 inched up 1 point or 0.02% to 6,482.Dow, on the other hand, slipped to 45,483, down 81 points or 0.18% at 7.20 PM IST.Shares in Nvidia slipped about 1%, despite the California-based company posting a profit of $26.4 billion on record second-quarter revenue of $46.7 billion.Investors had been eagerly awaiting the results late on Wednesday, as Nvidia’s rapid growth has helped fuel gains across tech stocks in recent months. However, its shares weakened after a fall in key data centre revenue, raising questions about whether the AI surge can continue at the same pace.""The market seems to be asking whether Nvidia can keep up this pace as competition intensifies and AI enthusiasm starts to look a little overbought,"" said Joshua Mahony, chief market analyst at traders Scope Markets.Alongside earnings, markets reacted to US data showing the world’s largest economy expanded by 3.3 percent in the second quarter, up from the 3.0% first estimated in July.""After the initial release, there were concerns that the domestic economy was slowing quite sharply,"" said Richard Flax, chief investment officer at Moneyfarm.According to the US commerce department, the upward revision was mainly due to stronger investment and consumer spending. Growth was also supported by a fall in US imports, after businesses had rushed to stockpile ahead of tariff increases announced by US President Donald Trump.The figures could influence the outlook for interest rates, with the Federal Reserve expected to continue cutting borrowing costs to support growth.""Overall, this release probably doesn't change Federal Reserve thinking too much,"" Flax said, noting that a 25-basis-point rate cut is still likely at the Fed’s September meeting.""But a stronger than expected result from domestic demand suggests that there might not be that much scope to cut rates over the next 12 months.""","The S&P 500 and Nasdaq both opened higher, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average traded in red.

US economy: Q2 GDP growth revised upward to 3.3%; driven by low imports and strong consumer spending,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-economy-q2-gdp-growth-revised-upward-to-3-3-driven-by-low-imports-and-strong-consumer-spending/articleshow/123565629.cms,"The United States economy showed stronger growth than previously estimated in the second quarter of the year, government figures showed on Thursday.According to the second estimates released by the US commerce department, the gross domestic product (GDP) rose at an annual rate of 3.3% between April and June, an upward revision from the 3.0% figure released in July.The rebound followed a difficult start to 2025, when the economy shrank by 0.5% in the first quarter, the first contraction in three years, largely due to the impact of Trump’s trade wars.The first-quarter downturn was driven by a surge in imports, as companies rushed to stockpile foreign goods ahead of new tariffs. Since imports are deducted from GDP, this sudden rise dragged the figures down.However, the trend flipped in the second quarter, with imports plunging at a 29.8% pace, a shift that added more than five percentage points to April–June growth.The US bureau of economic analysis said that the increase in the country’s GDP was mainly driven by a sharp drop in imports, along with higher consumer spending.The department also reported that consumer spending, which makes up about 70% of GDP, rose at a 1.6% annual rate. While still modest, this was better than both the 0.5% growth seen in the first quarter and the 1.4% initially estimated for the second quarter.However, this growth was partly held back by weaker investment and lower exports.Corporate profits from current production, which include inventory valuation and capital consumption adjustments, grew by $65.5 billion in the April–June period, compared with a fall of $90.6 billion in the previous quarter.Private investment, however, declined steeply, dropping at a 13.8% annual pace, the biggest fall since the second quarter of 2020, when the coronavirus pandemic was at its peak. A reduction in private inventories alone shaved nearly 3.3 percentage points off second-quarter GDP growth, AP reported.The real gross domestic income increased 4.8% in the second quarter against the 0.2% achieved in the first quarter. The average of real GDP and real GDI rose by 4.0% in the second quarter, a sharp turnaround from the 0.1% decline recorded in the first quarter.Government spending also weighed on the economy. Federal expenditure fell at a 4.7% annual rate, following a 4.6% decline in the first quarter.Since his return to the White House, Trump has overturned decades of US trade policy that traditionally favoured free trade. He has imposed double-digit tariffs on imports from nearly every country and targeted key products such as steel, aluminium and cars. Trump argues that tariffs protect American industry, encourage factories to return to the United States, and help finance the sweeping tax cuts he signed into law on July 4.Mainstream economists, however, warn that tariffs could harm the economy by raising costs and making protected US firms less competitive. They point out that tariffs are paid by importers in the United States, who often pass on the extra costs to customers through higher prices. While the inflationary impact so far has been limited, they caution it could grow over time, AP reported.The unpredictable way Trump has introduced tariffs, sometimes announcing them, suspending them, and then launching new ones, has left businesses unsettled and uncertain about making investments or hiring.The third estimate for the GDP growth of the second quarter will release on September 25.","GDP rose at an annual rate of 3.3% between April and June, an upward revision from the 3.0% figure released in July. rebound followed a difficult start to 2025, when the economy shrank by 0.5% in the first quarter, the first contraction in three years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123565784,imgsize-200744,width-400,resizemode-4/us-economy-grows-33-in-second-quarter.jpg"
Ontorio liquor ban stays: Doug Ford warns no American booze without fair trade deal; domestic sales surge,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/ontorio-liquor-ban-stays-doug-ford-warns-no-american-booze-without-fair-trade-deal-domestic-sales-surge/articleshow/123562269.cms,"Representative Image (AI-generated)

Ontario Premier Doug Ford on Wednesday said that the province’s ban on American alcohol will stay in place until US President Donald Trump removes tariffs on Canadian goods or a new free trade deal is reached. He cautioned that such an agreement could take a long time.Ford introduced the ban in March, ordering the Liquor Control Board of Ontario (LCBO) to remove US alcohol from its shelves in response to Trump’s tariffs on Canadian products. He indicated the ban could become a bargaining chip in upcoming negotiations on a new North American free trade pact, as reported by CBC.""If there's a deal, another USMCA deal, which I don't think is going to happen for the next few months — but you never know with President Trump, he could pull the carpet out from underneath us in a heartbeat like he has before — or they get rid of their tariffs and then we'll bring the booze back into the LCBO, and if they don't, then they aren't getting any booze on our shelves,"" Ford said.Last week, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney announced that the country would lift certain retaliatory tariffs on American goods covered under the Canada-US-Mexico Agreement (CUSMA), signaling a different approach from Ford.In March, Canada had imposed 25 per cent tariffs on a wide range of American products, including oranges, alcohol, motorcycles, and cosmetics. Carney explained that those measures reflected the state of negotiations at the time, but a different approach is now required.However, Canada is keeping its counter-tariffs on steel, aluminum and automobiles at 25 per cent.Trump has steadily increased tariffs on Canadian goods, raising them to 35 per cent in August, citing cross-border fentanyl flows and Canada’s counter-tariffs as reasons. Some duties remain exempt under CUSMA.Ford continues to push for a firm response, saying Canada must protect its steelworkers by matching US tariffs dollar-for-dollar.""I just believe when they're tariffing us 50 per cent on our steel and the whole world's using Canada as a dumping ground for steel, we have to make changes,"" Ford said.""We're tariffing them 25 per cent, fair is fair. I'd tariff them 50 per cent on our aluminum, copper, forestry products and obviously steel. We have to protect our steelworkers here in Ontario. So we have to fight fire with fire, but we'll see how the prime minister makes out.""Meanwhile, Ontario’s ban has boosted domestic alcohol sales. Since the policy took effect, Ontario wine sales have risen 67 per cent, while overall sales of Ontario and Canadian-made alcohol at the LCBO grew 19 per cent in three months.In Quebec, the liquor board was considering discarding expired US alcohol but was directed instead to donate it to charity. Ford said Ontario has no plans to destroy American alcohol yet.""We still have a few months before anything expires and we'll take it from there,"" he said.His office clarified that less than one per cent of US alcohol has expired and another one per cent will not expire for another decade.Liberal parliamentary leader John Fraser argued that the alcohol ban should be leveraged by the federal government during trade negotiations. However, he noted that Ford is not involved in the talks and said the premier’s tough words about Trump are just for show.“It’s all show and no substance,” Fraser said.","Ontario Premier Doug Ford said that the province’s ban on American alcohol will stay in place until US President Donald Trump removes tariffs on Canadian goods or a new free trade deal is reached.

Trump’s fresh warning to Russia

US President Donald Trump has issued a fresh warning of ‘economic war’ to Russia if Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy fail to resolve their ongoing conflict.According to a Bloomberg report, Trump said the ‘economic war’ would be ‘very bad’ for Russia. ""It will not be a world war, but it'll be an economic war, and an economic war is going to be bad. It's going to be bad for Russia, and I don't want that,"" Trump said during a White House cabinet meeting, Bloomberg reported.Despite Trump's pledge to terminate Russia's Ukrainian campaign upon taking office, the situation has been difficult, even following the landmark August 15 Trump-Putin summit in Anchorage, which was anticipated to facilitate progress.Also Read | ‘Country first, commerce later’: Indian refiners unlikely to stop Russia crude oil trade under US pressure; ‘message from government is…’ Trump has consistently warned of sanctions and additional repercussions for Moscow and countries whose Russian oil purchases he believes finance its military operations.Whilst he has implemented increased tariffs of 50% on Indian imports due to their Russian oil procurement, he has refrained from imposing similar measures on China and other countries purchasing Russian petroleum.When questioned about establishing a deadline for Putin to accept bilateral discussions with Zelenskiy before implementing proposed sanctions, Trump addressed the matter directly.""It's very serious what I have in mind, if I have to do it,"" Trump declared, in reference to the significant weekly casualties resulting from the conflict.The diplomatic efforts between Putin and Zelenskiy, facilitated by Trump, suggested a potential first face-to-face dialogue between the opposing leaders since Russia's comprehensive invasion of its neighbouring state over three years ago.Also Read | 'If West criticises, you are doing right..’: Russia slams Trump’s 25% penal tariffs on India - 10 hard-hitting statements for reality check to US Despite initial optimism following the Alaska discussions, no concrete meeting arrangements have materialised.

The global flow of parcels to the United States has been thrown into chaos after several countries temporarily suspended shipments following the Trump administration’s removal of the “de minimis” tariff exemption. The exemption, which allowed shipments of goods worth $800 or less to enter the US duty-free, which were eliminated starting August 26.The new rules, aimed at bolstering domestic manufacturing by slowing low-cost imports, have triggered disruptions in postal networks and e-commerce supply chains. Small businesses and individual sellers worldwide are struggling to find alternatives as parcels face duties ranging from $80 to $200 depending on the country’s tariff rate.Australia Post has temporarily partially suspended postal services to the US and Puerto Rico, effective August 26, citing changes in US customs rules and the elimination of the de minimis exemption. “We are disappointed we have had to take this action, however, due to the complex and rapidly evolving situation, a temporary partial suspension has been necessary to allow us to develop and implement a workable solution for our customers,” the postal service said.Australian retailers, including e-commerce brands, have reported significant logistical challenges.“This response is in-line with action taken by numerous postal operators internationally,” it added.Japan Post announced a temporary suspension of small parcels valued over $100 destined for the US, effective August 27. Economy Minister Ryosei Akazawa said alternative shipping options remain available, but the move is expected to affect low-value e-commerce shipments.Chunghwa Post has stopped sending small parcels to the US from August 26. The postal service cited a lack of a global system to prepay customs duties and the suspension of merchandise mail by contracted carriers.The country's postal service, called Chunghwa Post, said it has stopped delivering packages as “the global postal system has not yet provided a service allowing senders to prepay customs duty, and Chunghwa Post’s contracted carriers have also announced suspension of merchandise mail deliveries,"" as quoted by CNN.India’s postal service has temporarily suspended some outbound shipments to the US, noting logistical challenges and uncertainty over the new tariff rules.Thailand Post has announced a temporary halt on certain parcels to the US, especially low-value shipments, due to the removal of the de minimis exemption.Korea Post has suspended some parcel deliveries to the US, though customers can still send items via private carriers such as UPS.New Zealand Post has temporarily stopped some outbound mail to the US, citing uncertainty over customs and tariff compliance under the new rules.Hongkong Post has stopped accepting surface mail to the US immediately, and air mail items from April 27. The move was described as a response to “bullying” tariff hikes by the US administration.European postal operators and DHL have joined the wave of suspensions, with DHL halting acceptance of shipments to the US from August 25.

The American planemaker has secured a series of major contracts in recent months.Korean Air CEO Cho Won-tae, who toured one of Boeing’s US factories ahead of the announcement, told Reuters the investment would help South Korea’s largest airline expand to more destinations across the United States, Latin America and South America.Cho said about half of the new 103 aircraft would be 737 MAX 10 planes, with the rest split between 777-9 and 787 jets. He added that around 80% of the new fleet would replace older planes currently in service.He noted that the company had faith in Boeing despite prior troubles the planemaker experienced.According to South Korea’s industry ministry, the Boeing portion of the order is worth $36.2 billion, alongside the GE deal. Boeing said the agreement would also aid Korean Air’s integration with Asiana Airlines, which it acquired last year.“As Korean Air transitions to a larger unified carrier, we are committed to supporting the airline's growth with one of the world's most efficient fleets,” Stephanie Pope, president and CEO of Boeing Commercial Airplanes told Reuters.US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick hailed the deal as a boost for American exports. “The world recognizes that our aircraft are the most advanced in the world, and this administration is committed to reshoring advanced manufacturing jobs for Americans,"" he said.The agreement follows earlier discussions. In March, South Korea’s industry ministry revealed Korean Air was preparing to finalise a $32.7 billion order for Boeing aircraft and GE engines.

US President Donald Trump’s attempt to dismissal Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook is expected to land in court, raising questions over the extent of presidential powers against the traditionally independent central bank.Legal experts say Trump’s claim that he can fire Cook, a Biden appointee, is legally weak but unprecedented. The Supreme Court has recently allowed presidents more authority to remove agency officials, but the Fed has never faced such a challenge.If Trump succeeds, the Fed’s political independence could be weakened, a shift economists warn may make it harder to curb inflation. Without independence, the central bank could be forced into politically driven decisions, pushing up borrowing costs for mortgages, car loans and businesses.“It's an illegal firing, but the president’s going to argue, ‘The Constitution lets me do it,’” said Lev Menand, a Columbia University law professor and author of a book on the Fed. “And that argument’s worked in a few other cases so far this year.”Menand added that the Supreme Court could effectively set new constitutional law in this case.Cook, who joined the Fed board in 2022, is likely to seek an injunction against Trump’s order so she can continue serving.That leaves the Fed in a difficult position.“They have their own legal obligation to follow the law,” Menand said.“And that does not mean do whatever the president says. ... The Fed is under an independent duty to reach its own conclusions about the legality of Lisa Cook’s removal.”Trump announced Cook’s dismissal late on Monday via a Truth Social post, claiming she was guilty of mortgage fraud.Cook immediately rejected the move, saying “President Trump purported to fire me ‘for cause’ when no cause exists under the law, and he has no authority to do so,” she said in an emailed statement.“I will not resign.”The fraud allegations were made last week by Bill Pulte, a Trump appointee at the agency regulating Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Pulte alleged Cook listed two primary residences, in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and Atlanta, in 2021 to secure better mortgage terms. Mortgage rates are generally higher on second homes or rentals.Cook has brought in Washington lawyer Abbe Lowell to represent her. Lowell said Trump’s “reflex to bully is flawed and his demands lack any proper process, basis or legal authority,” adding, “We will take whatever actions are needed to prevent his attempted illegal action.”Cook is the first Black woman to serve as a Federal Reserve governor. A Marshall Scholar, she studied at Oxford University and Spelman College, and has taught at Michigan State University and Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government.","US President Donald Trump's attempt to dismissal Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook is expected to land in court.

US to buy stakes in Lockheed Martin, Boeing?

The Donald Trump administration seems to be eyeing America’s top defence giants for a stake after it struck a deal with Intel last week. The US government is evaluating potential ownership stakes in defence industry firms, including Lockheed Martin Corp, US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has said.According to a Reuters report, Lutnick confirmed this development on Tuesday whilst supporting President Donald Trump's initiative for increased government involvement in American industry.""They're thinking about it,"" Lutnick told CNBC, citing Pentagon leaders, when asked if the administration was considering taking pieces of contractors such as Lockheed Martin, Boeing, or Palantir Technologies.Last week, the Trump administration revealed it had acquired nearly 10% ownership in the semiconductor manufacturer Intel.The US government had earlier stepped in to finalise Nippon Steel's acquisition of US Steel in June, securing what Trump referred to as a ""golden share"" that provides Washington control over its functions.A significant debate has emerged regarding defence procurement. According to Lutnick, Lockheed Martin derives 97% of its revenue from US government contracts, effectively functioning as a government extension.""There's a lot of talking that needs to be had about how do we finance our munitions acquisitions,” Lutnick saidLockheed Martin, whose shares increased by 1.7%, issued a statement confirming their ongoing positive collaboration with President Trump's administration to enhance national defence capabilities.Boeing's shares rose 2.1%, and Palantir's stock, after an initial minor decline of approximately 1%, demonstrated a 1.7% increase during New York's midday trading, the Reuters report said.The comments represent another instance of unprecedented White House involvement in private industry, with interventions typically reserved for wartime scenarios or for protecting crucial domestic enterprises during economic difficulties.Recently, the Trump administration also acquired ownership in MP Materials, a rare earths firm, and facilitated an agreement with Nvidia and AMD requiring them to share 15% of their revenue from Chinese sales of previously restricted chips.During his Monday address, Trump expressed his intention to increase government funding in robust American enterprises, despite concerns from opponents who suggest such governmental involvement could restrict business flexibility and market responsiveness, whilst raising questions about consumer implications.The extraordinary degree of federal government involvement in economic matters has led to surprising collaborations, including liberal US Senator Bernie Sanders supporting the investment in Intel.On Tuesday, Lutnick said that organisations seeking federal aid must be ready to interact with Trump.""If a company comes to the United States of America government and says: 'We need your help, we want to change everything' ... I think that's a question between the CEO and the president of the United States of whether he will listen to them and change the rules,"" he told CNBC, citing the Nvidia deal.""If we are adding fundamental value to your business, I think it's fair for Donald Trump to think about the American people,"" Lutnick added.","US to buy stakes in Lockheed Martin, Boeing?

US economy: Consumer confidence slips again in August; job market fears rise for eighth month,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-economy-consumer-confidence-slips-again-in-august-job-market-fears-rise-for-eighth-month/articleshow/123529222.cms,"American consumers became less confident of the US economy in August, as worries over the jobs market continuing to mount for the eighth month in a row.Figures released on Tuesday by the Conference Board showed that its consumer confidence index slipped to 97.4 in August from 98.7 in July, a 1.3-point decline. The reading, though modest, stayed within the same tight range recorded over the past three months and matched economists’ expectations.Short-term expectations for income, business conditions and employment also weakened, falling by 1.2 points to 74.8. Remaining well below the 80 mark, the figure is seen by many economists as a signal that recession risks are rising. Consumers’ assessment of current conditions edged down too, at 131.2 in August compared with 132.8 the month before.Despite unemployment and layoffs still being historically low, analysts say that the labour market has lost momentum this year, with increasing signs that job seekers are struggling.In July, US employers created only 73,000 jobs, far fewer than the 115,000 economists had forecast. Revisions to earlier figures for May and June erased another 258,000 jobs. The unemployment rate also crept up from 4.1% to 4.2%.The disappointing update shook financial markets and led US President Donald Trump to dismiss Erika McEntarfer, the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which publishes the monthly figures.Government data from June highlighted further weakness, with job openings falling to 7.4 million from 7.7 million in May. The number of workers quitting their jobs, a measure of confidence in finding new opportunities, also declined.More updates on the labour market are expected next week when August’s hiring and June’s job openings reports are released.The Conference Board added that mentions of inflation and high prices had risen again in August, often linked to tariffs. Separate data this month showed consumer prices were steady between June and July, but wholesale inflation jumped unexpectedly. Economists warn that tariffs on imports are pushing up costs for businesses and could soon result in higher prices for households.The share of Americans expecting a recession within the next year rose in August to the highest level since April, when the tariff measures were first rolled out.","Consumer confidence index slipped to 97.4 in August from 98.7 in July.

The global flow of parcels to the United States has been thrown into chaos after 25 countries decided to halt shipments, as fears over US President’s looming tariffs grow.The Universal Postal Union (UPU), a United Nations agency, confirmed on Tuesday that several nations had suspended deliveries due to uncertainty created by President Donald Trump’s new tariff rules.""The postal operators of 25 member countries have already advised the UPU that they have suspended their outbound postal services to the US, citing uncertainties specifically related to transit services,"" the organisation said in a statement cited by AFP.The decision follows earlier moves by postal operators in Asia and Europe. Australia’s government-owned postal service had also announced temporarily halting parcel deliveries to the US, citing changes made by Washington to long-standing customs rules.Australia Post said the action was unavoidable after the Trump administration scrapped a regulation that had allowed low-value packages to enter the US duty-free. From 29 August, the US will impose duties on goods valued at $800 or below, suspending the “de minimis” exemption.Under the new rules, parcels sent through the postal system face one of two tariffs: either an ""ad valorem duty"" equal to the effective tariff rate of the package's country of origin, or, for six months, a flat charge of $80 to $200 depending on the country’s tariff rate, Reuters reported.Packages to the US and Puerto Rico lodged on or after 26 August will not be accepted until further notice. Letters, documents, and gifts worth under $100 are exempt.""We are disappointed we have had to take this action, however, due to the complex and rapidly evolving situation, a temporary partial suspension has been necessary to allow us to develop and implement a workable solution for our customers,"" Australia Post said in a statement.Japan Post also announced on Monday that it had suspended some items, though economy minister Ryosei Akazawa insisted the impact would be limited since other shipping options remained available. South Korea has stopped shipping parcels to the US, though customers can still send through its partnership with UPS.FedEx, however, stressed it would continue to operate normally. ""As an express carrier, our international express offerings are not impacted by the decisions of postal operators,"" FedEx Regional vice president Peter Langley told Reuters.","25 countries have suspended outbound postal services to the US due to tariff uncertainty.

ADB to the rescue? Pakistan eyes $2 billion railway upgrade; China’s decade-long rail promise falters,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/adb-to-the-rescue-pakistan-eyes-2-billion-railway-upgrade-chinas-decade-long-rail-promise-falters/articleshow/123522957.cms,"Representative image

The Asian Development Bank is set to finance improvements to Pakistan's railway infrastructure, taking over from China following extended delays in securing Chinese funding that risked affecting a crucial mining venture, according to sources quoted by Reuters.The initial plan for renovating 1,800 km of railways was a key component of China's $60 billion investment initiative in Pakistan, announced in 2015 as part of the Belt and Road Initiative. However, after ten years of discussions, the railway upgrade financing remains unresolved, whilst Pakistan faces challenges in repaying existing Chinese project debts.Sources familiar with the matter told Reuters that the ADB is finalising arrangements to spearhead a $2 billion upgrade of a 500-km railway section from Karachi to Rohri. This development has become crucial for transporting copper ore from the Reko Diq mine, currently under development by Canada's Barrick Mining Corp.""We will have a crisis. How will you evacuate output from Reko Diq? The exhausted line will come under even more pressure,"" stated a senior government official. Pakistan's railways ministry offered no immediate response, while China's foreign ministry affirmed, ""China and Pakistan are iron friends and all-weather strategic partners.""The ADB declined to confirm the financing arrangement but acknowledged ongoing discussions with Pakistan regarding railway sector development. The agreement, anticipated to be announced this month, involves the ADB leading a consortium and selecting an international engineering contractor through competitive bidding.The diplomatic considerations have been addressed with China, according to sources. The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor has seen reduced momentum, with the last significant project completed in 2022. Pakistan faces challenges with payments for Chinese-built power stations and seeks debt restructuring.The Reko Diq copper and gold mine, crucial to Pakistan's mining sector development, aims to commence production in 2028, yielding approximately 200,000 metric tonnes of copper concentrate annually. The ADB-backed railway upgrade will enhance the track system for faster diesel train operations between Karachi and Rohri.The project faces additional challenges, including security concerns in Balochistan province, where militant activities frequently target railway infrastructure. Tim Cribb, Reko Diq's project director, confirmed collaborative efforts between the government and Barrick regarding financing for the western railway branch to Rohri.","The Asian Development Bank is set to finance improvements to Pakistan's railway infrastructure, taking over from China.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume.

The deal was called off earlier this year after a due diligence process undertaken by PhonePe, while evaluating the potential acquisition failed to meet its bar. The Walmart-owned fintech major had, however, hired some 130 of ZestMoney's employees.","The move will impact some 150 employees of the firm, the company's management told employees in a town hall on Tuesday.

Startups will play important role in helping India become 3rd largest economy: CEA Nageswaran,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/startups-will-play-important-role-in-helping-india-become-3rd-largest-economy-cea-nageswaran/articleshow/105332523.cms,"Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor ( CEA ) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran Udaan until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.Udaan built an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business still accounts for a very small part of India’s overall retail market but can balloon to $150 billion in sales and yield a 100% return on capital invested in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co. estimates published in the Mint newspaper.Bengaluru-based Udaan has also ventured into financing through its fintech unit which helps shopkeepers get working capital loans to buy inventory. That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says.

How India's GDP has been growing

What SBI report said on savings and investment

Incremental capital output ratio

NEW DELHI: India's gross domestic product (GDP) data for the third quarter (October-December 2022) received a word of caution from the former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan In an interview with news agency PTI, Rajan that India is ""dangerously close"" to the Hindu rate of growth in view of subdued private sector investment, high interest rates and slowing global growth.India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying"".However, a report released by the State Bank of India (SBI) economists on Tuesday dismissed arguments that India is dangerously close to Hindu rate of growth saying such statements are ""ill-conceived, biased and premature"".The term 'Hindu growth rate' was coined by late economist Raj Krishna in 1978 to describe the slow growth in the country.It basically refers to the low pace of economic growth rates during 1950s to 1980s. During this period, the Indian economy averaged 3.5%.A former lecturer at the Delhi School of Economics (DSE), Krishna noted that only if the rate of growth is persistently slow and accompanied by low per-capita GDP, then it will be known as Hindu rate of growth but it has to factor in population growth as well.Before economic reforms of 1991, India's economic growth remained stagnant and low, while per capita income averaged around 1.3%. Krishna termed this low growth situation to be a result of socialist policies of state control and import substitution.However, the economic situation changed when liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation (LPG) reforms came into effect in the year 1991, at a time when India faced balance of payment crisis.Over the years, many economists have strongly opposed the idea of 'Hindu growth rate' and the term never had universal acceptance.The Indian economy plunged into its very first technical recession in FY21 due to the impact of Covid-19 pandemic and the related nationwide lockdowns. GDP shrunk by an unprecedented 23.8% in the first quarter of the financial year 2020-21. However, due to spurt in economic activities in the subsequent quarters, the GDP decline started to narrow.However, if we look at the period before Covid-19 as well, India's growth curve shows a declining trend.From 8.26% in FY17, GDP growth plunged to 3.74% in FY20. Shutdown of economic activities in FY21 in wake of Covid-19 only made matters worse.As lockdowns started to ease and business activities resumed, India's GDP also started rising. In Q1 of FY22, growth jumped to 20.1% mainly on account of low base effect. By the fourth quarter of FY22, growth came down to 4.10%.Similarly, the new financial year 2022-23 brought fresh economic challenges in the form of Russia-Ukraine war that impacted almost all major economies of the world, slowed the pace of growth, pushed inflation to record highs.As a result, the central banks of all advanced economies spurred into action and opted for monetary policy tightening to curb the soaring inflation.With persistently rising interest rates, India's economy grew by 4.4% in Q3 of FY23, as the Centre revised upwards GDP growth for previous year to 9.10% from 8.7% earlier.The report weighed recent GDP numbers against the available data on savings and investments for the past decade and highlighted some interesting points.""Quarterly growth numbers are noisy and should be best avoided for any serious interpretation (on an average, India's GDP growth has witnessed Rs 2 lakh crore upward revision for the 3 year ended FY23),"" the report said.Gross capital formation (GCF) by the government touched a high of 11.8% in 2021-22, up from 10.7% in 2020-21.""This also had a domino effect on private sector investment that jumped from 10 per cent to 10.8% over the same period,"" it said.In fact, Ecowrap added that the trends in GCF to gross output ratio or the plough back of funds for creation of fresh capacity shows that for public administration the ratio attained fresh peak in 2021-22 owing to the emphasis on capital expenditure in recent budgets.At the aggregate level, gross capital formation is supposed to have crossed 32% in 2022-23, the highest level since 2018-19.According to the report, in 2021-22, gross savings have risen to 30% from 29% in 2020-21.""The ratio is supposed to have crossed 31 per cent in 2022-23, the highest since 2018-19. The household savings increased sharply during the pandemic period on account of sharp accretion in financial savings such as deposits,"" said the report by SBI's Economic Research Department.While household financial savings have since then moderated from 15.4% in 2020-21 to 11.1% in 2022-23, savings in physical assets have grown sharply to 11.8% in 2021-22 from 10.7% in 2020-21.The report further analysed Incremental Capital Output ratio (ICOR) -- which measures additional units of capital (investment) needed to produce additional units of output. It said that the ratio has been improving.""ICOR which was 7.5 in FY 12 is now only 3.5 in FY22. Clearly, only half of capital is now needed for next unit of output,"" the report noted.Such reducing ICOR in the current years reflects a relatively increasing efficiency of capital and shows that the economy is on a sound footing, the report said.""From that point of view, future GDP growth rates even at 7% could still mean a decent number by any standards!,"" it added.","India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.

An employee is entitled for a 50 per cent amount of the last drawn salary as pension.OPS was discontinued by the NDA government in 2003 with effect from April 1, 2004.Under the new pension scheme (NPS), employees contribute 10 per cent of their basic salary towards pension while the government contributes 14 per cent.Governments of Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand have informed the central government/ Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA about their decision to restart OPS for their employees.The government of Punjab on November 18, 2022, issued a notification regarding implementation of OPS for the state government employees who are being covered under NPS. Jharkhand too has decided to revert to OPS.",Former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan has expressed his concern over the decision of some states to restart the old pension scheme.

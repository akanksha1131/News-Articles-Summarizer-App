Gold price prediction today: Gold prices which rose in the initial half of the past week erased its gains towards the end. The precious metal edged lower after unexpectedly strong US Producer Price Index (PPI) data released showed inflation remaining higher on Month on Month basis.

Likely stance that Fed Chair Powell delivers a dovish shift is eminent from Fed funds future pricing in 21 – 25 bps of rate cuts in September although the big jump in July’s PPI inflation adds a layer of uncertainty raising the risk that Fed chair may signal even 2 – 3 rate cuts this year.Physical gold demand in Asia remains mixed in recent week as the jewellery sector continues to struggle under the weight of high prices with no new import quotas announced & actual physical demand from Chinese traders appears more or less limited.Meanwhile on global macroeconomic front, dollar looks vulnerable to remain subdued amid fresh strength seen in Euro to keep gold downside limited in the current week.On the geopolitical front with yesterday’s summit in Washington resulting in a clearer roadmap for peace talks & some openness about security guarantees from the US had only resulted in temporary downside for gold.US macro developments including FOMC meeting minutes due tomorrow & Fed chair speech due later in the week remain the biggest driver for dollar & gold, which could provide major directional bias for the yellow metal.

"Washington DC unemployment at a high for third straight month: District's July rate reaches 6% mark; federal cuts, court-backed layoffs fuel rise",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/washington-dc-unemployment-at-a-high-for-third-straight-month-districts-july-rate-reaches-6-mark-federal-cuts-court-backed-layoffs-fuel-rise/articleshow/123399824.cms,"Unemployment on rise in Washington (AI-image)

US capitol Washington DC maintained the nation's highest seasonally adjusted unemployment rate for three consecutive months, according to recent Bureau of Labour Statistics data released on Tuesday.The District's July unemployment rate reached 6%, primarily due to extensive federal workforce reductions implemented by President Donald Trump 's Department of Government Efficiency. The declining international tourism, a significant revenue source for DC, is anticipated to further affect the District's rising unemployment figures, according to the analysis cited by Associated Press.July data showed increased unemployment in neighbouring states, with Maryland rising to 3.4% from 3.3% and Virginia increasing to 3.6% from 3.5%, as per state-specific unemployment statistics.Since Trump's second term commenced, federal agencies have experienced widespread staff reductions through layoffs and voluntary resignations, prompting legal challenges from labour unions and advocacy organisations.The Supreme Court's July ruling enabled the Trump administration to proceed with federal workforce reductions, despite concerns about service disruptions and substantial job losses among federal employees.Recent DC Office of Revenue Analysis data indicates increasing unemployment payments to federal workers. April payments totalled $2.01 million, rising to $2.57 million by June.The DC Fiscal Policy Institute suggests these federal layoffs will worsen the District's Black-white unemployment disparity. The current national unemployment rate is 4.2%, with South Dakota recording July's lowest rate at 1.9%.US international tourism continues declining. The World Travel & Tourism Council reports reduced visits from British, German and South American tourists, attributed to Trump's policies, tariffs and border-related concerns.A May analysis projects international visitor spending in the U.S. to decrease to nearly $169 billion this year from $181 billion in 2024, representing a 22.5% reduction from the previous peak.These employment statistics follow the Republican president's and GOP governors' deployment of National Guard troops to DC, aiming to address crime and strengthen immigration enforcement.","US capitol Washington DC maintained the nation's highest seasonally adjusted unemployment rate for three consecutive months.

Air Canada strike: Restart plan suspended as union defies return-to-work order; prolonged standoff deepens travel chaos,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/air-canada-strike-government-ends-flight-attendants-walkout-services-to-resume-but-cancellations-linger/articleshow/123345627.cms,"Air Canada suspended its planned restart of operations on Sunday after flight attendants refused to comply with a government back-to-work order that they called “unconstitutional. ” The order had required them to return to duty by 2 p.m. ET (1800 GMT), but the union vowed to continue its strike, prolonging widespread cancellations and travel disruptions.Earlier today, Air Canada announced that it will restart flights on Sunday evening after the Canadian government intervened to end a strike by its 10,000 flight attendants that left more than 100,000 travellers stranded during the peak summer season.The airline, Canada’s largest, said it will take several days before operations return to normal and warned that some flights would remain cancelled over the next seven to 10 days until schedules stabilise.Federal Jobs Minister Patty Hajdu ordered attendants back to work less than 12 hours after they walked off the job at 1 a.m. on Saturday, citing the broader economic impact, AP reported.“Now is not the time to take risks with the economy,” Hajdu said, pointing to the unprecedented tariffs the US has imposed on Canada.The dispute has been referred to the Canada Industrial Relations Board, which extended the current collective agreement until a new one is decided by arbitration.The walkout had paralysed operations of the carrier, which runs nearly 700 flights daily. The shutdown was affecting about 130,000 passengers a day. Aviation analytics firm Cirium said Air Canada had cancelled 671 flights by Saturday afternoon, following 199 cancellations on Friday. Another 96 flights scheduled for Sunday were already suspended.The union had rejected Air Canada’s earlier request for government-directed arbitration, escalating the conflict. The government previously forced two major railroads into arbitration during a strike last year, a move unions challenged in court, arguing it weakened labour’s bargaining power. In this case, the Canadian Chamber of Commerce welcomed Ottawa’s intervention, and the Business Council of Canada had also urged binding arbitration.Hajdu stressed that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s Liberal government is “not anti-union,” but added it was clear both sides were at an impasse.Air Canada announced that passengers affected by cancellations would be eligible for full refunds through its website or mobile app. It also promised to arrange alternative travel with other Canadian and foreign airlines “where possible,” but cautioned that immediate rebooking could not be guaranteed as flights on other carriers were already full during the busy summer season.The airline and the Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE) have been negotiating for nearly eight months without success. Pay remains the most contentious issue. Air Canada said its latest proposal offered a 38% increase in overall compensation, including benefits and pensions, over four years, a package that “would have made our flight attendants the best compensated in Canada.”The union disagreed, arguing that the proposed 8% raise in the first year fell short of addressing inflation and raised concerns about the unpaid work flight attendants perform when aircraft are not in the air.","Air Canada flight attendants refused to comply with a government back-to-work order that they called “unconstitutional” The order had required them to return to duty by 2 p.m. ET (1800 GMT), but the union vowed to continue its strike, prolonging widespread cancellations and travel disruptions.

Top stock market recommendations:Nifty has hit its initial target of 25050 – 25250 from the point it reversed after closing above 24600.

Any closing above 55800 is likely to set the toner for further bullishness on the index while a retest of 55500 – 55550 is likely to act as buy on dip for the index for a 3-4% rally unfolding from current levels.The stock of Godawari Power and Ispat Limited had been trading in a range since last few months and has given a highest close in calendar year 2025 yesterday with very strong volumes.

'Greater of the two risks': Inflation overshadows employment at Fed policy meeting; minutes reveal divisions over Trump’s tariffs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/greater-of-the-two-risks-inflation-overshadows-employment-at-fed-policy-meeting-minutes-reveal-divisions-over-trumps-tariffs/articleshow/123421041.cms,"Federal Reserve building

Minutes from the US Federal Reserve’s late July policy meeting revealed that a majority of officials viewed upside inflation risks as more significant than employment concerns, highlighting internal disagreements over the economic impact of President Donald Trump's tariffs.""A majority of participants judged the upside risk to inflation as the greater of these two,"" the report said, as quoted by the Associated Press, adding that, "" a couple of participants considered downside risk to employment the more salient"" one.The minutes reflected divisions within the Federal Open Market Committee, with dissenting votes from Fed governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman in July. Despite Trump’s repeated calls for rate cuts, policymakers kept interest rates at 4.25–4.50 percent. Waller and Bowman supported a 25 basis point reduction, with Bowman citing concerns about economic weakening and ""the risk of damage to the labor market. ""Wednesday’s released minutes noted that while two officials preferred lower rates, the dissenters appeared isolated. They believed tariffs would not have a persistent effect on prices but remained concerned about labor market conditions.Economic activity growth slowed during the first half of 2023, with tariff impacts ""becoming more apparent in the data, as indicated by recent increases in goods price inflation.""Several officials warned that inflation has persistently exceeded the Fed’s two-percent target, raising concerns about long-term expectations, particularly if tariffs continue to affect prices. Participants also noted that the full impact of higher duties on consumer costs could take time to show.Oxford Economics economist Ryan Sweet said, ""The labour market will be the swing factor on whether the Fed cuts interest rates in September or not."" He added, ""It's likely the August employment report and revisions will be the determining factor."" Sweet noted that ""odds are rising that the Fed cuts sooner than we anticipate.""In another development, the ongoing tensions escalated between Trump and the Federal Reserve, with the US President publicly demanding the resignation of Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook. This call comes amid his persistent criticism of Fed Chair Jerome Powell for not reducing interest rates.Trump took to his Truth Social platform to express his demand, citing a Bloomberg report that highlighted concerns raised by the Federal Housing Finance Agency's director regarding Cook's mortgage dealings. The director, Bill Pulte, a known Trump supporter, reportedly urged the US attorney general to investigate Cook, suggesting potential criminal activity.Cook responded to the allegations, stating she first learned of them through social media. She clarified that the mortgage in question was obtained before her tenure at the Federal Reserve. In a statement to AFP, Cook said, ""I have no intention of being bullied to step down from my position because of some questions raised in a tweet,"" However, she acknowledged the importance of addressing questions about her financial history and is working to provide accurate information.The Trump administration has a history of pursuing mortgage fraud allegations against prominent Democrats, often seen as political rivals. It remains uncertain whether an official investigation into Cook will be initiated, as she is the first Black woman to serve on the Federal Reserve's board.The president's power to remove central bank officials is limited. A recent Supreme Court ruling indicates that Fed officials cannot be dismissed over policy disagreements, requiring a ""cause"" for removal, which typically involves evidence of wrongdoing.","Minutes from the US Federal Reserve’s late July policy meeting revealed that a majority of officials viewed upside inflation risks as more significant than employment concerns.

Shubman Gill not fit to lead in all three formats | Greenstone Lobo predicts

MUMBAI: Indian cricket's latest blue-eyed boy, Shubman Gill , is the new favourite with brands. His stellar performance in the India-England Test series, both as captain and batsman, had already bolstered his brand value. Now, Gill's selection for the Asia Cup as vice-captain will only give further impetus to his brand equity.A Gen Z with much of his career ahead of him, Gill has all the chops a brand looks for. ""Gill's brand value has appreciated by 30%-40% post the India-England series. His brand fees will increase anywhere in the range of 25%-50% depending on the kind of brand approaching him,"" Neeraj Jha, senior sports analyst and commentator, told TOI.From automobiles to global luxury brands, queries for Gill have shot up from an average of three to four per month to about 10-15 now, sources aware of discussions said. Gill currently charges endorsement fees in the range of Rs 4-5 crore for one brand per year. That can now easily go up to anywhere between Rs 6-8 crore, said Neerav Tomar, managing director and CEO at IOS Sports. Another analyst said that a few of his earlier deals were in the range of Rs 2-Rs 3.5 crore. ""Gill already endorses close to 20 brands, and this number should go up. Youthful brands will seek new faces. Gill is the new Virat Kohli ,"" Tomar said. Gill's team, however, declined to comment.The cricketer bagged a few big deals before the Test series. Tyre major MRF and global eyewear brand Oakley (for India) signed Gill as their brand ambassadors. Gill also expanded his associations with Casio and Coca-Cola during the year. From about eight brand associations in 2023, Gill's brand portfolio nearly doubled to 16 in 2025. The cricketer is estimated to have earned about Rs 40 crore in endorsement earnings in 2024.""A lot of MNCs are looking to sign Gill. Small brands can't afford him. His fees will only go up if he keeps on delivering,"" said Amitesh Shah, founder and CEO at sports, media, and entertainment company Legaxy, who estimates Gill's brand value to see a boost of over 40%. Sources said that Gill is ""selective"" about his brand partnerships, ensuring alignment with his values and career journey.Going ahead, perenniality (ability to deliver across all cricket formats) will be key for Gill to bag big brand deals, said Sandeep Goyal, chairman at Redifussion. ""Perenniality leads to continued visibility, which is key to the endorsement game,"" said Goyal.","A Gen Z with much of his career ahead of him, Gill has all the chops a brand looks for.

This is first close for the fund and the final one is expected by Oct end.Through this fund, the company will cut cheques in range of $40-$80 million for mid-sized firms; the bulk of the capital will be deployed in sectors with high market opportunity - consumer, financial services, manufacturing and healthcare, sectors that have been seeing high investor appetite due to the sheer market opportunity. The fund has made two investments, amounting to $125 million.“We will only invest in profitable companies. Through the investments, we will look to acquire significant minority stakes in companies...some of them could be major investments wherein we will acquire controlling stakes either individually or in partnership with other PE funds,” Vishal Tulsyan, founder and chairman at Motilal Oswal Alternates told TOI.The fund will invest in companies with a 5-10 year horizon, taking a long-term view which is how PE investors like to bet. In India, consumption patterns are evolving rapidly, nudging businesses to explore new expansion avenues and seek growth capital which is fueling opportunities for investors. Within healthcare and financial services, the scope is large given that they are still underpenetrated. Motilal Oswal Alternates has backed firms such as Lahori Zeera, HealthKart and Lal Sweets. It was also the first institutional investor in companies such as AU and Dixon, making 50 investments in all since inception in 2007.“As India grows as an economy, there will be a lot of money in the wallet of consumers for discretionary spending. Consumption in India will see a secular growth trend,” Tulsyan said. Typically, about half of the exits (from investments) for the company through its previous funds have been by way of IPO.

Hurricane Erin intensifies into a Category 5 storm,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/hurricane-erin-intensifies-into-a-category-5-storm/articleshow/123344001.cms,"AP file photo

In which direction is Hurricane Erin headed?







Hurricane Erin strengthened into a category 5 hurricane, the US National Hurricane Center (NHC) said on Saturday.Erin is about 160 miles (255 kilometers) north of Anguilla, as the NHC warned of possible flooding and landslides.Tropical storm watches have been issued for Anguilla, Barbuda, St. Martin, St. Barts, Saba, St. Eustatius and St. Maarten while heavy rains are expected in Antigua and Barbuda, the US and British Virgin Islands and southern and eastern Puerto Rico. Up to 4 inches (10 centimeters) of rain is anticipated, with isolated totals of up to 6 inches (15 centimeters), according to the NHC.The NHC said Eric could create powerful rip currents off parts of the US East Coast later in the week, even if its eye forecast remains far offshore.Hurricane expert Michael Lowry said Erin is forecast to eventually take a sharp turn northeast that would put it on a route between the US and Bermuda.""All of our best consensus aids show Erin turning safely east of the United States next week, but it'll be a much closer call for Bermuda, which could land on the stronger eastern side of Erin,"" he said.Erin is the Atlantic season's first hurricane and is expected to become a major Category 3 storm late this weekend, passing around 200 miles north of Puerto Rico.","Erin is about 160 miles (255 kilometers) north of Anguilla, as the NHC warned of possible flooding and landslides.

The Nasdaq composite slid 1% while the Dow Jones Industrial Average inched up just 3 points, or less than 0.1%, as of 11:35 a.m. Eastern time, AP reported.Nvidia, whose chips are driving much of the global AI boom, dropped 1.6% after Tuesday’s 3.5% fall, again becoming the heaviest weight on the market. Palantir Technologies tumbled 4.7% to add to its 9.4% loss from the previous day. Both stocks have soared this year but are now facing investor concerns that valuations ran too high too quickly. Nvidia shares are up 35.5% year-to-date, while Palantir has more than doubled.Analysts pointed to mounting caution around AI bets. A study by MIT’s Nanda Initiative suggested most corporations are not yet seeing measurable returns from generative AI investments. Ulrike Hoffmann-Burchardi, global head of equities at UBS Global Wealth Management, said the report may have added to the selling pressure.“Companies like Nvidia are still seen as the backbone of the AI revolution, but investors are asking whether the near-term payoff justifies the surge in valuations,” Hoffmann-Burchardi noted.Mixed earnings from retailers added to the uneven sentiment. TJX, the operator of TJ Maxx and Marshalls, gained 3.4% after beating Wall Street’s profit and revenue forecasts and raising its full-year outlook. CEO Ernie Herrman said the company is seeing “strong demand at each of our U.S. and international businesses” and reported a strong start to the current quarter.Lowe’s rose 0.2% after reporting better-than-expected profit and announcing an $8.8 billion deal to acquire Foundation Building Materials, a drywall and ceiling systems distributor. Target, however, slumped 8% after announcing CEO Brian Cornell would step down on February 1, with longtime executive Michael Fiddelke set to succeed him. Estee Lauder shed 5.2% on a weaker-than-expected profit forecast, citing tariffs that could shave about $100 million off annual earnings. La-Z-Boy plunged 13.2% after missing profit and revenue estimates.Investors are now turning their focus to Powell’s speech at the Jackson Hole symposium on Friday, a forum that has historically hosted major Fed policy signals. Wall Street is hoping for hints of interest-rate cuts as the central bank holds rates steady amid concerns that President Donald Trump’s tariffs could stoke inflation. A weak jobs report earlier this month has shifted expectations toward rate easing.Treasury yields continued to fall, with the 10-year yield easing to 4.28% from 4.30% late Tuesday.Overseas, markets were mixed. London’s FTSE 100 rose 1.2% despite data showing UK inflation rose faster than expected in July, driven by higher airfares and food prices. Japan’s Nikkei 225 fell 1.5% after exports slipped more than expected under the weight of US tariffs. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng added 0.2%, boosted by a 12.5% surge in Pop Mart International after its CEO projected annual revenue above $4 billion and announced a mini version of its Labubu dolls.","The S&P 500 fell 0.5%, heading toward its fourth straight loss after hitting an all-time high last week.

China had tightened export approvals as retaliation against US tariffs, a move that disrupted global supply chains.Exports slumped sharply in April and May due to long approval processes for securing licences, a bottleneck that left some automakers outside China facing production halts amid shortages of rare earths.Germany retained its position as the top export destination in July, with shipments rising 46% from the previous month to 1,116 tons. Outbound shipments to the United States also registered a sharp increase, jumping 75.5% from June to 619 tons, which was 4.8% higher than the same month in 2024.For the first seven months of this year, China’s exports of rare earth magnets totalled 27,897 tons. While the figure still reflected a 15% decline from last year, it marked an improvement compared to the 18.9% fall registered in the first half of 2025.","China's exports of rare earth magnets bounced back strongly in July, climbing to a six-month high.

Labubu doll maker Pop Mart chief executive Wang Ning on Wednesday said the toy company was on track to hit its 2025 revenue target of 20 billion yuan ($2.78 billion), adding that “30 billion ($4.18 billion) this year should also be quite easy. ”The company reported nearly 400 per cent surge in net profit, driven by strong demand in higher-margin overseas markets. The Pop Mart shares rose more than 5 per cent in early Hong Kong trading, according to Reuters.Executives said the company is exploring expansion into emerging markets across the Middle East, Central Europe, and Central and South America. “I think for overseas markets we're still very positive, and we also believe there's still very broad space for growth,” Wang said, noting that combined sales from North America and Asia Pacific this year would match China sales in 2024.Meanwhile, in the United States, where the ugly-cute doll maker currently operates about 40 stores, Wang said the company would begin a phase of “relatively rapid store openings” over the next year or two, with 10 new outlets planned by year-end.On Tuesday, the company reported that its toy line “The Monsters” generated 4.81 billion yuan ($669.9 million) in the first half, accounting for 34.7 per cent of total revenue. Four other toy series, including “Molly” and “Crybaby,” also crossed the 1 billion yuan sales mark during the period.Long known as a handbag charm, Pop Mart said it would launch a mini Labubu this week that can be clipped onto phones.","China toy maker eyes $4bn revenue this year; plans mini phone charms.

Powell’s term ends in May 2026, AP reported.Speaking to CNBC, Bessent said, “I’m going to be meeting with them, probably right before, right after Labor Day, and to start bringing down the list to present to President Trump.” He described the pool as “an incredible group” of candidates from within the Fed, former Fed members, and private sector professionals.While he did not specify the names, media reports have listed Fed governors Michelle Bowman and Christopher Waller, former Fed governor Kevin Warsh, and National Economic Council director Kevin Hassett as being in the running. Also mentioned are former regional Fed president James Bullard and Marc Sumerlin, a former economic adviser to President George W Bush.Bessent himself was previously seen as a contender but was ruled out earlier this month after Trump said he would remain Treasury chief.Trump has made no secret of his disdain for Powell, calling him a “numbskull” and “moron” in recent months. Fed policymakers, meanwhile, have been cautious with rate cuts as they assess the impact of Trump’s tariffs on global trade.Markets are also awaiting Powell’s address on Friday at the annual Jackson Hole gathering of central bankers, which could provide signals on whether further rate cuts are likely at the Fed’s mid-September policy meeting.","US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that interviews for Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s replacement are expected to start around September 1.

Air Canada said Tuesday it will gradually restart operations after reaching an agreement with the union representing 10,000 flight attendants to end a strike that had disrupted travel for about 130,000 passengers daily at the peak of the summer season.The deal was announced by the Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE) early Tuesday after both sides returned to the negotiating table late Monday for the first time since the walkout began over the weekend, AP reported.The union said the agreement guarantees pay for work performed while planes are on the ground, one of the key issues behind the strike. “Unpaid work is over. We have reclaimed our voice and our power,"" it said in a statement. “When our rights were taken away, we stood strong, we fought back — and we secured a tentative agreement that our members can vote on.”Air Canada chief executive Michael Rousseau called restarting operations a complex process and said it could take seven to ten days for full service to resume. “Full restoration may require a week or more, so we ask for our customers' patience and understanding over the coming days,” Rousseau said in a statement.The airline confirmed that flights would begin resuming Tuesday evening but warned some cancellations would continue until schedules stabilise. Mediation talks, it said, were based on the union’s commitment that flight attendants would immediately return to work.The deal came hours after the union had defied back-to-work directives, calling them unconstitutional. The Canada Industrial Relations Board had declared the strike illegal on Monday and ordered attendants to return to duty, but the union resisted. Leaders had also ignored an earlier weekend order to enter binding arbitration.The board, an independent tribunal, was directed by the government to intervene. Labour leaders have criticised Ottawa for repeatedly using laws to curb the right to strike, pointing out that similar measures had been imposed on port and railway workers in recent years. “Your right to vote on your wages was preserved,” the union said in an online post.Air Canada, which runs around 700 flights daily, had estimated that nearly 500,000 passengers were affected by cancellations since last Thursday. Aviation analytics firm Cirium said that by Monday afternoon the carrier had cancelled at least 1,219 domestic and 1,339 international flights.Toronto’s Pearson International Airport, the country’s largest, said it would deploy extra staff to assist travellers as operations resume. Air Canada added that passengers impacted by cancellations are eligible for full refunds through its website or mobile app.","Air Canada said Tuesday it will gradually restart operations after reaching an agreement with the union representing 10,000 flight attendants.

AU$90 million penalty: Qantas Airways fined for illegal sackings during Covid pandemic; judge questions lack of remorse,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/au90-million-penalty-qantas-airways-fined-for-illegal-sackings-during-covid-pandemic-judge-slams-lack-of-remorse/articleshow/123360283.cms,"Representative image

A judge in Australia fined Qantas Airways 90 million Australian dollars ($59 million) for unlawfully dismissing more than 1,800 ground staff during the early stages of the Covid-19 pandemic. The penalty is in addition to the AU$120 million ($78 million) compensation the airline had already agreed to pay dismissed employees.Justice Michael Lee of the Australian Federal Court ruled that the dismissal of 1,820 baggage handlers and cleaners at airports in late 2020 was the most serious breach of Australian labour laws in their 120-year history, according to the Associated Press.After Qantas’s appeal was unanimously rejected by seven High Court judges last December, the airline confirmed its wrongdoing and agreed to pay AU$120 million in compensation. The Transport Workers Union (TWU), which initiated the case, had sought the maximum penalty of AU$121 million.Justice Lee determined that AU$90 million was the minimum deterrent, noting Qantas executives had expected annual savings of AU$125 million through outsourcing. He also questioned the airline’s remorse, highlighting its subsequent unsuccessful attempt to avoid paying compensation.""If any further evidence was needed of the unrelenting and aggressive litigation strategy adopted in this case by Qantas, it is provided by this effort directed to denying any compensation whatsoever to those in respect of whom Qantas was publicly professing regret for their misfortune,"" Lee said.""I do think that the people in charge of Qantas now have some genuine regret, but this more likely reflects the damage that this case has done to the company rather than remorse for the damage done to the affected workers,"" he added.Following the ruling, Qantas CEO Vanessa Hudson, who was CFO at the time of the redundancies, issued an apology: ""We sincerely apologize to each and every one of the 1,820 ground handling employees and to their families who suffered as a result. The decision to outsource five years ago, particularly during such an uncertain time, caused genuine hardship for many of our former team and their families. Over the past 18 months we've worked hard to change the way we operate as part of our efforts to rebuild trust with our people and our customers. This remains our highest priority as we work to earn back the trust we lost.""Lee directed that AU$50 million of the fine be paid to the TWU, citing its role in exposing Qantas’s unlawful conduct when no government agency pursued the case. The allocation of the remaining AU$40 million will be decided in a future hearing.TWU national secretary Michael Kaine hailed the judgment, describing it as a landmark victory after a five-year legal battle. ""It is a significant — the most significant — industrial outcome in Australia's history and it sends a really clear message to Qantas and to every employer in Australia: Treat your work force illegally and you will be held accountable,"" Kaine said.""Against all the odds, we took on a behemoth that had shown itself to be ruthless and we won,"" he added.Qantas has also faced legal action over its treatment of passengers during the pandemic. The airline previously agreed to pay AU$120 million in compensation and fines after the competition watchdog accused it of misleading customers by selling tickets for more than 8,000 flights that had already been cancelled between May 2021 and July 2022.","A judge in Australia fined Qantas 90 million Australian dollars ($59 million) for unlawfully dismissing more than 1,800 ground staff.

US State Secretary Marco Rubio cautioned on Monday about potential energy price increases if the United States enforces secondary sanctions on China for processing Russian oil.The US secretary was asked, ""is Europe still buying Russian oil?""""Well, if you look at the oil that’s going to China and being refined, a lot of that is then being sold back into Europe. Europe’s also buying natural gas still. Now, there are countries trying to wean themselves off it, but there’s more Europe can do with regard to their own sanctions,"" Rubio responded during an interview with Fox Business on Sunday.The statement comes amid objections over the US's selective approach- imposing a 25% additional tariff on India (taking total to 50%) for Russian oil purchases while taking no comparable measures against China.Rubio was further asked about sanctions on Europe for continuing to purchase Russia oil. ""Wouldn't that be a major lever to pull to put sanctions on Europe or or punish Europe for continuing to buy oil and gas from Russia? Is that something on the table?"" asked Fox News' 'Sunday Morning Futures' anchor Maria Bartiromo.In response Rubio added, ""Well, I don't know about on Europe directly obviously, but certainly there are implications to secondary sanctions.If you put secondary sanctions on a country – let's say you were to go after the oil sales of Russian oil to China. Well, China just refines that oil. That oil is then sold into the global marketplace, and anyone who's buying that oil would be paying more for it or, if it doesn't exist, would have to find an alternative source for it,"" Rubio said further during the interview.""So we have heard, when you talk about the Senate bill that was being proposed where there was a hundred percent tariffs on China and India, we did hear from a number of European countries – not in press releases but we heard from them – some concern about what that could mean. But look, I don't want to get into a tit for tat with Europeans on this."" he further added.Currently, China leads Russian oil purchases at approximately 2 million barrels daily, with India and Turkey following.The sanctions discussion has resurfaced following Trump's notable meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska on August 15. Despite the summit failing to achieve a Ukraine ceasefire agreement, Trump described the talks as productive, giving them a ""10 out of 10.""Previously, the US president had suggested that India-targeted tariffs for Russian oil purchases influenced Moscow's decision to seek dialogue with Washington, citing Russia's loss of its ""second largest customer"".In his Fox News interview on Thursday, Trump had said, ""I think everything has an impact,"" adding that when he informed India ""we're going to charge you, because you're dealing with Russia and oil purchases"", it ""essentially took them out of buying oil from Russia"".However, India recently confirmed its continuation of Russian oil purchases despite US presidential tariff threats, maintaining its focus on economic factors.",US State Secretary Marco Rubio cautioned on Monday about potential energy price increases if the United States enforces secondary sanctions on China for processing Russian oil.

Contract talks break down

Travellers left in limbo

Air Canada has suspended all operations after more than 10,000 of its flight attendants walked off the job early Saturday, plunging peak summer travel into chaos and leaving passengers stranded around the world.The strike began shortly before 1 am EDT after a deadline to reach a new contract passed, Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE) spokesman Hugh Pouliot confirmed, as per news agency AP.The airline announced soon after that it would halt flights entirely, strongly advising customers “not to go to the airport” and expressing “deep regret” over the disruption, reported news agency AFP.The complete shutdown is affecting Air Canada’s full schedule of about 700 daily flights, impacting roughly 130,000 travellers per day, including an estimated 25,000 Canadians abroad.By Friday night, the airline had already cancelled 623 flights affecting more than 100,000 passengers, according to AFP.Negotiations between Air Canada and CUPE have been ongoing for about eight months but remain deadlocked over pay and compensation for unpaid ground duties. The union has refused to enter government-directed arbitration, which would have removed its right to strike, saying it wants to bargain directly.“We’re here to bargain a deal, not to go on strike,” Pouliot said in an email cited by AP, adding that Air Canada had not countered the union’s last two proposals since Tuesday.Air Canada’s latest offer included a 38% increase in total compensation over four years, which it said would make its flight attendants the best paid in Canada.A Thursday statement from the airline detailed that, under the proposal, a senior flight attendant would earn about C$87,000 by 2027.The union has rejected the offer, calling it “below inflation and below market value”. CUPE is also seeking pay for ground duties such as boarding, which are currently uncompensated, a standard practice in the airline industry but one the union says is unfair.Rafael Gomez, director of the University of Toronto’s Centre for Industrial Relations, was quoted by AFP as saying that while unpaid pre-flight work is common globally, CUPE has successfully framed it as an issue of fairness in the public eye. “That’s a very good issue to highlight,” he said, noting that any gains here could influence other carriers.With planes grounded, travellers have been left scrambling. Montreal resident Alex Laroche, 21, said he and his girlfriend had saved since Christmas for an $8,000 European vacation — now at risk. “At this point, it’s just a waiting game,” Laroche said, as per AP.He initially resented the strike but changed his mind after learning about the wage dispute, saying, “Their wage is barely livable.”Air Canada says passengers can request full refunds via its website or app, and it will attempt to rebook travellers on other carriers where possible. However, the airline warns that alternative flights are already full due to summer demand.Canada’s federal jobs minister Patty Hajdu urged both sides to “work harder” to resolve the dispute, calling it “unacceptable that such little progress has been made”. The Business Council of Canada warned before the strike that halting Air Canada’s passenger and cargo services could cause “immediate and extensive harm” to the economy.Industry experts expect the stoppage to be short-lived. “This is peak season,” Gomez said. “The airline does not want to lose hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue… They’re almost playing chicken with the flight attendants”.","Air Canada has suspended all operations after more than 10,000 flight attendants walked off the job early Saturday.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021.

It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran Udaan until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.Udaan built an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business still accounts for a very small part of India’s overall retail market but can balloon to $150 billion in sales and yield a 100% return on capital invested in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co. estimates published in the Mint newspaper.Bengaluru-based Udaan has also ventured into financing through its fintech unit which helps shopkeepers get working capital loans to buy inventory. That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says. Udaan competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods. The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-105001128,imgsize-151312,width-400,resizemode-4/105001128.jpg"

How India's GDP has been growing

What SBI report said on savings and investment

Incremental capital output ratio

NEW DELHI: India's gross domestic product (GDP) data for the third quarter (October-December 2022) received a word of caution from the former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan In an interview with news agency PTI, Rajan that India is ""dangerously close"" to the Hindu rate of growth in view of subdued private sector investment, high interest rates and slowing global growth.India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying"".However, a report released by the State Bank of India (SBI) economists on Tuesday dismissed arguments that India is dangerously close to Hindu rate of growth saying such statements are ""ill-conceived, biased and premature"".The term 'Hindu growth rate' was coined by late economist Raj Krishna in 1978 to describe the slow growth in the country.It basically refers to the low pace of economic growth rates during 1950s to 1980s. During this period, the Indian economy averaged 3.5%.A former lecturer at the Delhi School of Economics (DSE), Krishna noted that only if the rate of growth is persistently slow and accompanied by low per-capita GDP, then it will be known as Hindu rate of growth but it has to factor in population growth as well.Before economic reforms of 1991, India's economic growth remained stagnant and low, while per capita income averaged around 1.3%. Krishna termed this low growth situation to be a result of socialist policies of state control and import substitution.However, the economic situation changed when liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation (LPG) reforms came into effect in the year 1991, at a time when India faced balance of payment crisis.Over the years, many economists have strongly opposed the idea of 'Hindu growth rate' and the term never had universal acceptance.The Indian economy plunged into its very first technical recession in FY21 due to the impact of Covid-19 pandemic and the related nationwide lockdowns. GDP shrunk by an unprecedented 23.8% in the first quarter of the financial year 2020-21. However, due to spurt in economic activities in the subsequent quarters, the GDP decline started to narrow.However, if we look at the period before Covid-19 as well, India's growth curve shows a declining trend.From 8.26% in FY17, GDP growth plunged to 3.74% in FY20. Shutdown of economic activities in FY21 in wake of Covid-19 only made matters worse.As lockdowns started to ease and business activities resumed, India's GDP also started rising. In Q1 of FY22, growth jumped to 20.1% mainly on account of low base effect. By the fourth quarter of FY22, growth came down to 4.10%.Similarly, the new financial year 2022-23 brought fresh economic challenges in the form of Russia-Ukraine war that impacted almost all major economies of the world, slowed the pace of growth, pushed inflation to record highs.As a result, the central banks of all advanced economies spurred into action and opted for monetary policy tightening to curb the soaring inflation.With persistently rising interest rates, India's economy grew by 4.4% in Q3 of FY23, as the Centre revised upwards GDP growth for previous year to 9.10% from 8.7% earlier.The report weighed recent GDP numbers against the available data on savings and investments for the past decade and highlighted some interesting points.""Quarterly growth numbers are noisy and should be best avoided for any serious interpretation (on an average, India's GDP growth has witnessed Rs 2 lakh crore upward revision for the 3 year ended FY23),"" the report said.Gross capital formation (GCF) by the government touched a high of 11.8% in 2021-22, up from 10.7% in 2020-21.""This also had a domino effect on private sector investment that jumped from 10 per cent to 10.8% over the same period,"" it said.In fact, Ecowrap added that the trends in GCF to gross output ratio or the plough back of funds for creation of fresh capacity shows that for public administration the ratio attained fresh peak in 2021-22 owing to the emphasis on capital expenditure in recent budgets.At the aggregate level, gross capital formation is supposed to have crossed 32% in 2022-23, the highest level since 2018-19.According to the report, in 2021-22, gross savings have risen to 30% from 29% in 2020-21.""The ratio is supposed to have crossed 31 per cent in 2022-23, the highest since 2018-19. The household savings increased sharply during the pandemic period on account of sharp accretion in financial savings such as deposits,"" said the report by SBI's Economic Research Department.While household financial savings have since then moderated from 15.4% in 2020-21 to 11.1% in 2022-23, savings in physical assets have grown sharply to 11.8% in 2021-22 from 10.7% in 2020-21.The report further analysed Incremental Capital Output ratio (ICOR) -- which measures additional units of capital (investment) needed to produce additional units of output. It said that the ratio has been improving.""ICOR which was 7.5 in FY 12 is now only 3.5 in FY22. Clearly, only half of capital is now needed for next unit of output,"" the report noted.Such reducing ICOR in the current years reflects a relatively increasing efficiency of capital and shows that the economy is on a sound footing, the report said.""From that point of view, future GDP growth rates even at 7% could still mean a decent number by any standards!,"" it added.","India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.

An employee is entitled for a 50 per cent amount of the last drawn salary as pension.OPS was discontinued by the NDA government in 2003 with effect from April 1, 2004.Under the new pension scheme (NPS), employees contribute 10 per cent of their basic salary towards pension while the government contributes 14 per cent.Governments of Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand have informed the central government/ Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA about their decision to restart OPS for their employees.The government of Punjab on November 18, 2022, issued a notification regarding implementation of OPS for the state government employees who are being covered under NPS. Jharkhand too has decided to revert to OPS.",Former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan has expressed his concern over the decision of some states to restart the old pension scheme.

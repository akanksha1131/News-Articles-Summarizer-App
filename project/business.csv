'Largest' tax refunds? How much cash will actually hit Americans’ bank accounts?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/largest-tax-refunds-how-much-cash-will-actually-hit-americans-bank-accounts/articleshow/125923537.cms,"White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt

How much each Americans will get?



Americans, you can rejoice as your wallet just got good news, even before the world gets its hands on GTA 6.On Thursday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said that Americans can expect an extra amount in their bank accounts in the months ahead, all because of Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which he signed into law in July.Leavitt told reporters, “Americans can expect another boost in their bank accounts in the months ahead.” She added that 2026 tax refunds are “projected to be the largest ever thanks to President [Donald] Trump’s passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill.”Citing analysis from investment bank Piper Sandler, Leavitt said refunds “could be about one-third larger than usual, or roughly an extra $1,000 per filer.”On Wednesday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told reporters that working Americans would receive “very large refunds” next year, amounting to about $1,000 to $2,000 per household. He said the increased refunds were a direct result of the tax cuts in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.The cost of living has been a central concern for many Americans in recent months. Democrats have criticised the Trump administration over affordability issues, while Republicans have backed the president’s tax legislation as delivering relief.In an X post on December 4, the White House said, Largest tax refund season in American history.Thanks to extended tax cuts and retroactive tax relief provided by the Working Family Tax Cuts.Representative Brendan Boyle, a Pennsylvanian Democrat, said in a December 9 X post, Trump called the cost-of-living crisis a ‘con,’ but now he’s in Pennsylvania claiming he’s lowering costs. His empty promises are the real con — and Pennsylvanians aren’t buying it. This is the same guy raising prices with his tariff taxes and taking health care from Americans.House Speaker Mike Johnson said in a December 10 X post, This is a LIFE-CHANGING boost for America’s children. And remember: Nearly EVERY Democrat voted to block this from happening.Taxes are due on April 15-2026. Americans typically receive their tax refunds within weeks of filing.","White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said that 2026 tax refunds are “projected to be the largest ever thanks to President [Donald] Trump’s passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill.” She said refunds “could be about one-third larger than usual, or roughly an extra $1,000 per filer”","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125923620,imgsize-892020,width-400,resizemode-4/pic-22.jpg"

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market, other asset classes or personal finance management tips given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)

Gold futures on MCX witnessed a sharp rally overnight, touching highs near ₹1,32,610 before encountering resistance and slipping lower in early trade. The momentum indicators now suggest overbought conditions, and prices are showing signs of exhaustion near the upper band. This keeps the intraday bias vulnerable to a corrective move if support levels fail to hold. A sell signal activates below ₹1,32,300, with defined risk and clear downside potential.The price has extended significantly above both short-term moving averages, indicating a stretched rally. EMA 8 is steep but beginning to flatten, a common early sign of momentum cooling. A break below ₹1,32,300 would shift prices back toward the EMA cluster, reinforcing bearish pressure.Gold is trading at the upper Bollinger band after a vertical rise. This suggests price overextension, and a move below the mid-band could accelerate selling toward the lower volatility zone.RSI is at 72.7, firmly in the overbought territory. This level often precedes corrective pullbacks, especially when combined with slowing price momentum.MACD remains positive, but histogram bars are shrinking, indicating weakening bullish strength. A downward crossover in the next few sessions is possible if price slips below key support.Failure to hold ₹1,32,300 will expose the lower pivot levels, increasing the probability of a corrective slide.Gold’s intraday technical structure points toward a possible pullback from overbought levels. Bears may regain control if the price slips below ₹1,32,300, opening room toward ₹1,31,700. Traders should maintain strict risk parameters with a stop-loss at ₹1,32,750.","Jateen Trivedi, VP Research Analyst - Commodity and Currency, LKP Securities.

US President Donald Trump on Wednesday (local time) launched the ""Trump Gold Card,"" offering legal status and an eventual pathway to United States citizenship for individuals and corporations willing to make large financial contributions.Announcing the rollout on Truth Social, Trump wrote, ""The United States Government’s Trump Gold Card is here today! A direct path to citizenship for all qualified and vetted people. So exciting! Our Great American Companies can finally keep their invaluable Talent. Live Site opens in 30 minutes!""A website accepting applications went live soon after, as Trump unveiled the program in the Roosevelt Room of the White House, joined by business leaders.Trump said the funds raised through the initiative would ""go to the US government,"" adding that the program could generate ""billions"" for the Treasury Department ""where we can do positive things for the country.""""Very excitingly for me and for the country, we've just launched the Trump Gold Card. The site goes up in about 30 minutes, and all funds go to the United States government.... It's a gift to get somebody great coming into our country, because we think there will be some tremendous people who otherwise wouldn't have been allowed to stay.They graduate from college, they have to go back to India or China or France... The companies will be very happy. The other thing is it'll take in, we think, probably billions of dollars that will go to the Treasury of the United States... Many billions of dollars, even,"" he told reporters further talking about the initiative.The Trump Gold Card is a new US visa-residency programme that costs $1 million for individual applicants. The Trump Gold Card programme effectively provides a pathway to permanent legal residency, similar to a green card but, as Trump claims, ""with big advantages.""""It's somewhat like a green card, but with big advantages over a green card. Companies will be able to go to any school, buy a card, and keep that person in the United States…"" Trump added.It is intended to replace the existing EB-5 investor visa programme, subject to vetting by the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS).The card resembles a luxury credit card, featuring a gold background along with Donald Trump’s portrait, the Statue of Liberty, and the US flag, with ""Trump Gold Card"" embossed on the left.The Trump Corporate Gold Card allows companies to sponsor one or more foreign employees. Corporations must pay a non-refundable $15,000 DHS fee per employee, and the programme requires a $2 million gift per sponsored employee after vetting is completed.Companies can apply for multiple employees simultaneously.A notable benefit of the corporate version is that companies may stop sponsoring one employee and use the same previously paid $2 million contribution to sponsor a new employee without paying another gift amount.""The Trump Corporate Gold Card is subject to a small, 1% annual maintenance fee and a 5% transfer fee, which includes the cost of a new DHS background check. Small additional fees to the US Department of State may also apply depending on each employee’s circumstances, the website noted.Individual applicants must make a one-time, non-refundable $1 million gift, whereas corporate sponsors pay $2 million per employee. Both require the same DHS processing fee of $15,000.Applicants must first pay a non-refundable $15,000 DHS processing fee. Once the vetting process is complete, the required $1 million ""gift"" from an individual (or $2 million for a corporation per applicant) serves as proof that the applicant will ""substantially benefit the United States.""Additional small fees may be charged by the US Department of State depending on individual circumstances. Once an applicant’s processing fee is received, the process for petition approval and visa adjudication will take place on an expedited basis, assuming applicants submit any additional documents or fees in a timely manner.The $15,000 processing fee can be paid by credit card or ACH (US accounts only). The $1 million or $2 million contribution must be sent via ACH debit or SWIFT wire transfer after vetting.For Visa-related fees - The applicant will receive information directly from the US Department of State on how to submit the visa application fee and payments for the required medical examination.Like other American permanent residents and citizens, Trump Gold Card holders are required to pay US taxes, including on income earned outside the United States.Applicants must be eligible for lawful permanent resident status, admissible to the United States, and have a visa available under the EB-1 or EB-2 categories.Yes. Spouses and unmarried children under 21 can be included in the initial application. Each family member must pay an additional $15,000 DHS fee and a $1 million gift, with the same expedited processing benefits.""This will ensure that these family members receive all of the privileges conferred by the Gold Card Program, including expedited processing,"" the website said.Yes. Since the Trump Gold Card functions as a visa, it can be revoked on grounds of national security concerns or significant criminal activity.Here is the simplified step-by-step process, based on the details provided on the Gold Card website:The programme promises an expedited timeline, with processing expected to take a few weeks, provided applicants respond promptly to interview requests and document submissions, the website said.The upcoming Trump Platinum Card will allow individuals to live in the US for up to 270 days a year without paying US tax on non-US income, eliminating the need for additional travel visas.It is priced at $5 million, plus the $15,000 DHS fee, and has not yet been launched. A waitlist has opened, and applicants are being encouraged to secure their place early.The design for the Trump Platinum Card has not yet been revealed, but the website encourages users to join a waitlist, with applications processed on a first-come, first-served basis.The website warns that the $5 million Platinum Card contribution ""may not remain"" at the current price, leading many to join the waitlist early.""Foreign nationals can sign up now and secure their places on the waiting list for the Trump Platinum Card. When launched, and upon receipt of a $15,000 DHS processing fee and $5 million contribution, they will have the ability to spend up to 270 days in the United States without being subject to US taxes on non-US income,"" the website added.The Platinum Card cannot be obtained by anyone who has previously been subject to US tax on foreign income, such as ""US citizens or resident aliens,"" they said.The Trump Gold Card comes with several limitations that raise questions about its accessibility and long-term impact. Unlike the EB-5 system it replaces, the new programme has no job-creation requirement for investors or employers.Trump’s announcement also made no mention of annual caps, leaving uncertainty around oversight, scalability and how the scheme fits into broader US immigration policy.For businesses, the card does not guarantee lower costs. Each corporate card applies to only one employee, meaning expenses rise with every additional hire. Companies needing to retain multiple foreign-born graduates may end up paying millions.This makes the programme more suitable for wealthy individuals or well-funded corporations, offering little relief to smaller firms facing talent shortages.","US President Donald Trump on Wednesday (local time) launched the ""Trump Gold Card,"" offering legal status and an eventual pathway to United States citizenship.

Rupee hits new record low: Currency weakens to 90.46 versus US dollar; RBI likely intervened to stem fall,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/rupee-hits-new-record-low-currency-weakens-to-90-46-versus-us-dollar-rbi-intervention-likely/articleshow/125907270.cms,"Rupee versus dollar (AI image)



RBI Slashes Rates After Rupee Fall, Boosts Liquidity And Lifts India’s GDP Forecast To 7.3%

The Indian rupee tanked to a fresh record low on Thursday, going past the 90 mark versus the US dollar again. The rupee has been depreciating sharply this year, influenced by ongoing challenges on the India-US trade deal front and increased corporate dollar demands.The rupee declined to 90.4675 versus the US dollar, surpassing its previous historic low of 90.42 recorded on December 4.The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) reportedly stepped in on Thursday to prevent further depreciation of the rupee's value, five traders were quoted as saying by Reuters.The rupee has declined over 5% against the dollar in 2025, ranking as the third-poorest performer amongst 31 primary currencies, with only the Turkish lira and Argentina's peso showing greater losses. This downward trend is significant, coming at a time when the dollar's strength measure has reduced by more than 7%.Several elements contribute to the rupee's negative performance, including growing trade deficits, hefty 50% US tariffs on Indian goods, and outward foreign capital movement. The lack of successful negotiations with the Donald Trump administration has further weakened the currency's position.The currency continues to experience pressure after falling past the crucial 90 mark, which is 50% of its 2011 value.This situation creates additional difficulties for RBI governor Sajay Malhotra and central bank officials in their efforts to maintain balance between rupee flexibility and market steadiness, while steering clear of past financial issues.India's capital controls restrict the rupee's convertibility, requiring RBI's participation in both domestic and international markets for intervention. In global markets, rupee trading occurs primarily through non-deliverable forwards (NDFs), which are derivatives contracts setting exchange rates with dollar settlements.The RBI implements interventions via the Bank for International Settlements, working alongside selected major banks as trading partners in continuous markets operating across Singapore, Dubai and London.","The Indian rupee tanked to a fresh record low on Thursday, going past the 90 mark versus the US dollar again.

Benchmark indices traded in a range with corrective bias and is currently placed around 25,900 levels as domestic markets tracked the global risk-off tone, pressured by persistent FII selling, a softer rupee, and ongoing uncertainty around US–India trade talks. In the short term, market direction will hinge on central bank commentary and clarity on trade-related developments.In the near term, market trajectory is likely to be dictated by currency stabilization dynamics, especially whether the rupee can find a durable floor. Moreover, clarity on evolving India–US trade negotiations could influence sector-specific outlooks, particularly in export-linked and tariff-sensitive industries.Nifty has key support placed at 25,700–25,800, which aligns with the bullish gap from November 12, the 50-day EMA, and a key retracement zone of the prior uptrend. Sustaining this band will be crucial for continuing the positive momentum of the last 3 months.We expect the Nifty to consolidate in the range of 25,700–26,200. A clear breakout or breakdown will determine the next directional move.A close below the key support area of 25,700 will signal extension of the corrective decline towards the 100 days EMA placed around 25400 levels.On the higher side, a move above the recent swing high of 26,200 will signal extension of the rally towards 26,500 levels in the coming weeks.Bank Nifty traded in a range, digesting its recent strong gains. The index consolidated in a 700-points range oscillating in a positive and negative territory.We expect the index to extend consolidation and form a base in the range of 58500-60100 in the coming sessions.A follow-through strength above recent high 60,100 will open further upside towards 61,000 levels in the coming weeks.The entire up move of the last 2 months is well channelled signaling sustained demand at elevated levels. Key support is placed at 58,300-58,600 levels being the confluence of the last two weeks lows and recent breakout area. Holding above the support area will keep the short-term bias positive.Eternal has been in a corrective phase over the past two to three months and is now consolidating around a major demand zone. This technical setup points to a favorable risk-reward profile, suggesting the potential for a bullish reversal and a rebound from its current oversold levels.The current corrective phase seems to be losing momentum, with price action hinting at a possible rebound toward the ₹323 area in the coming months. This zone aligns with the 50% Fibonacci retracement of the entire drop from ₹368 to ₹280 and also matches the November 2025 high, strengthening its significance as a major resistance level.The stock is at the cusp of generating a breakout above a falling channel signaling resumption of up move thus offers fresh entry opportunity.The stock has already taken 6 weeks to retrace just 50% of its preceding 5 weeks rally (5636-6904). A shallow retracement signals a higher base formation and an overall positive structure.We expect the stock to head towards 6850 levels being the trendline resistance joining the highs of July and November 2025.","According to Bajaj Broking Research, the top stocks to buy for December 12, 2025 are Eternal, and Divi's Laboratories.

China's economic strain: November retail sales growth drops to three year low; factory output misses estimates,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/chinas-economic-strain-retail-sales-growth-drops-to-three-year-low-factory-output-also-fails-to-meet-forecasts/articleshow/125969050.cms,"China’s November economic data pointed to a continued strain as retail sales fell to a three-year low and both consumer spending and investment weakened.Figures released on Monday by the National Bureau of Statistics showed that retail sales increased by only 1.3% from a year earlier, marking the slowest growth since the Covid period and falling well short of expectations. The figures missed Bloomberg's estimate, that had projected sales growth to hold steady at 2.9%, similar to October.Factory output also softened, with industrial production expanding 4.8% in November, missing Reuter's estimate of a 5% rise. A month earlier, the figures stood at 4.9%.Investment activity also remained under pressure, as fixed-asset investment declined 2.6% in the first 11 months of the year amid a continued collapse in property investment, according to Bloomberg. The urban unemployment rate was unchanged at 5.1%, indicating little improvement in labour market conditions.Annual car sales also plunged to 8.5% in November, marking the steepest decline in 10 months. The figures came as a disappointment to an industry that usually sees a strong sales in the last two months of a year, Reuters reported. It further added that even after the Singles' Day Shopping festival stretched across five weeks this year, failed to woo customers.China’s difficulty in reviving domestic consumption is making the economy more exposed to external risks. In recent months, growth has relied largely on overseas demand, even as the tariff war launched by US President Donald Trump continues to reshape global trade.At home, weak demand from consumers and businesses has dragged on the world’s second-largest economy for years, leading to deflation that has hit profits and wages. Recent trends, according to Bloomberg, point towards further headwinds, with loan growth slowing and investment registering a sharp and unexplained drop in recent months.These concerns were reflected in last week’s high-level economic meetings, where China’s leadership placed the expansion of domestic demand at the top of the agenda for the year ahead, citing uncertainty in foreign trade. While officials reaffirmed their intention to keep growth-supportive policies in place, they stopped short of signalling any immediate, forceful intervention.","Retail sales increased by only 1.3% from a year earlier, marking the slowest growth since the Covid period.

Morgan Stanley has an overweight rating on Adani Power with a target price Rs 185. Analysts said the company expects to achieve 100% tie up for 23.7GW under construction capacity by next year. The company targets to reduce current united capacity from 10% to 3-4%. Analysts said that at current tariffs, they expect earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) to be Rs 3.7/unit for new bids. They said the company's current capex is between Rs 95-100 million/MW, compared to peers' Rs 150 million/MW due to advance equipment ordering and faster execution.CLSA maintained outperform rating on Dixon Technologies with the target price at Rs 18,800. Analysts said that the stock corrected on concerns around FY27 earnings per share (EPS).

Professional CEOs crowd million-dollar-salary club,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/professional-ceos-crowd-million-dollar-salary-club/articleshow/125968702.cms,"Mumbai: With uncertainty becoming the new normal in global business, India Inc is increasingly leaning on professional CEOs to steer companies and handing them million dollar pay cheques as they power growth in the era of the unknown.Among CEOs taking home a million dollars (over Rs 8 crore) or more across BSE 200 companies, the count of professional leaders has surged nearly 71% to 145 in FY25 from 85 five years ago (see graphic). The promoter CEO count has largely remained flat in the same period, going up to 65 from 60, data shared by global executive search firm Stanton Chase with TOI showed.“Five years ago, promoter-led companies dominated many sectors. Today, professional CEOs are leading most of India’s large businesses and earning a premium. Boards want leaders who bring independence, experience across cycles, and the ability to manage complex global expectations. This trend is a sign of India Inc becoming more institutional and future-focused,” said Amit Agarwal, MD, India & Singapore at Stanton Chase.The IT/ITes space leads the million-dollar CEO cohort — the sector recorded the biggest jump in compensation in the last five years followed by manufacturing at 34%.Former Wipro CEO Thierry Delaporte tops the list with Rs 168-crore compensation in FY25, followed by Persistent Systems CEO Sandeep Kalra with Rs 148-crore pay. Among promoter CEOs, Pawan Munjal, CMD at Hero MotoCorp leads with Rs 109-crore compensation, the study showed.Professional CEOs are increasingly replacing promoter-led leadership not because promoters are disengaging, but because the needs of modern businesses have evolved, said Vibhav Dhawan, partner at Positive Moves. A once-in-a-generation pandemic and wars aside, trade protectionism and rising geopolitical uncertainties have upended corporate India’s rule book and go-to strategies.“India is getting integrated with the global economy very well. This was not the case 10 years back. Businesses are becoming far more complex and multi-functional which is why there’s a rise in professional CEOs,” said Anshuman Das, CEO and founder at Longhouse. Besides, private equity investors are joining the cap table of large businesses, driving some changes in the way companies operate and overhauling governance structures, said Das.The million dollar pay cheques, however, are not coming easy. Instead of increasing fixed salaries, boards have shifted to performance-linked pay, increasing the burden of accountability. Fixed compensation declined to about 31% in FY25 from 35% in FY21.“More of a CEO’s earnings now depend on actual outcomes, including profits, cash flow and resilience. It’s a much more accountability-driven model than before,” said Mala Chawla, MD, India at Stanton Chase.The average CEO compensation grew to Rs 10 crore in FY25 from Rs 9.3 crore in FY21 with the total compensation jumping to Rs 4,700 crore from Rs 2,700 crore in the same period. The growth in the million-dollar club has to do more with Indian companies becoming bigger and more profitable, not because compensation is being aggressively inflated, said Chawla.","Among CEOs taking home a million dollars (over Rs 8 crore) or more across BSE 200 companies, the count of professional leaders has surged nearly 71% to 145 in FY25.

Integration complexities await IDBI Bank bidders,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/integration-complexities-await-idbi-bank-bidders/articleshow/125968531.cms,",

Mumbai: With less than a fortnight left for bids for IDBI Bank to close, the field has narrowed to Prem Watsa's Fairfax Holdings and Kotak Mahindra Bank.The absence of a broader bidding war reflects not a lack of capital, but the complexity of integrating technology, HR culture and branch networks.Both bidders face material integration challenges. For Kotak, the issue is largely operational. IDBI's branch-heavy network would need rationalisation, adding to the already demanding task of technology integration. More importantly, IDBI's credit-deposit ratio of about 87% makes it less attractive to a private bank that is primarily hunting for low-cost deposits rather than incremental loan assets.Fairfax's challenges are deeper and more structural. The Canadian investor already controls CSB Bank, a smaller private-sector lender that runs on a different core banking system- Oracle's Flexcube. Absorbing IDBI would force Fairfax into difficult choices.","The absence of a broader bidding war reflects not a lack of capital, but the complexity of integrating technology, HR culture and branch networks.

The bill was referred to a select committee of Parliament, which is looking at the provisions. Officials said that ministries will be suggesting amendments to the panel and a high-level committee headed by former cabinet secretary has also made several suggestions, which will be shared with the select committee of Parliament.“The idea is to make life simpler for businesses as they often spend years running to legal forum fighting to get their names cleared and avoid jail sentences for minor offences,” said an official. In some cases, officials said, the nature of violations have changed but the laws have not kept pace with the changes.TOI has learnt that the road transport ministry has identified over a dozen additional provisions under the Motor Vehicles Act and National Highways Act to decriminalise them, in addition to the over 50 provisions that have been included in the Jan Vishswas Bill 2.0.Sources said these were also shared with the Parliamentary panel. For example, the provision of jail for withholding any information or giving false information would be replaced with Rs 500-Rs 2,000 penalty. Similarly, the provision of up to six months jail for driver for failing to secure medical aid, give accident details and insurer after an accident would be replaced with Rs 5,000-Rs 10,000 penalty. The provision of up to jail and Rs 25,000 fine for guardian or owner for juvenile committing offence would be replaced with only a penalty.For driving a vehicle without insurance, the current provision of jail and fine would be replaced with three-to-five times increase in premium. In hit and run cases, the current provision of two-year jail or Rs 25,000 fine or both, it would be changed to Rs 1 lakh fine.Similarly, the provision of up to five years jail or fine for intentionally damaging an NH stretch would be replaced with a high penalty.Sources said provisions of fine and jail for offences under the Metro Railways Operation and Maintenance Act would be replaced with penalty. These include jail and fine for drunkenness or nuisance on metro railway, unlawfully entering or remaining upon metro railway or walking on metro track.","Ministries and departments are working overtime to push for decriminalising 300-400 provisions across laws.

India ranks 3rd in Stanford AI Vibrancy index,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/india-ranks-3rd-in-stanford-ai-vibrancy-index/articleshow/125968330.cms,".

NEW DELHI: As the world moves towards AI-led transformation across industries, govt and the broader society, India has been ranked third in ‘AI Vibrancy’ index in a study conducted by Stanford University. The US and China lead the pack.The 2025 version of Stanford’s ‘Global AI Vibrancy Tool’ works with data coverage through 2024 across a set of parameters, which measure the preparedness of countries when it comes to AI.The framework comprises seven pillars of AI vibrancy: Research and development, responsible AI, economy; talent, policy and governance, public opinion, and infrastructure. The tool ranks 36 countries, while expanding indicator-level data coverage to 67 countries for selected indicators in the AI Metrics Over Time category. On India, the Stanford report says that the country has received a score of 21.59 in the 2024 Global Vibrancy Index, and is ahead of South Korea (17.24) and the UK (16.64).“India made a notable leap from seventh place in 2023 to third, while the UK rose one spot from sixth to fifth. Both countries have recently renewed major initiatives to strengthen their positions in the global AI ecosystem,” it says. India also scored strongly in the Innovation Index assessment, as well as economic competitiveness.The US continues to lead the 2024 Global Vibrancy Index by a wide margin, with a total weighted score of 78.6, with many of the global AI models coming out from the country. It tops nearly all pillars of the index, except for those measuring talent and public opinion. “The country’s strength is especially concentrated in the research and development, economy, and infrastructure pillars. Many of the leading AI models released in 2024, such as Gemini 2.0 Pro, o1, and Llama 3.1, were developed by US-based companies,” the report says.","India has been ranked third in ‘AI Vibrancy’ index in a study conducted by Stanford University.

Mukesh Ambani vs. Gautam Adani: Which Indian business tycoon has a more impressive education background?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/education/news/mukesh-ambani-vs-gautam-adani-which-indian-business-tycoon-has-a-more-impressive-education-background/articleshow/125931766.cms,"Mukesh Ambani and Gautam Adani

Mukesh Ambani: School and college

Gautam Adani: Learning by doing

Two ways to reach the top

Who has a better education background?

Lessons for young professionals

When we talk about business in India, Mukesh Ambani and Gautam Adani come up in every conversation. Their companies touch everything from energy to ports, from telecom to infrastructure. People track their every move, their deals, their investments, and the headlines make it look like their success was inevitable. But there is one part of their story that doesn’t get much attention: how they learned to run businesses in the first place. Ambani went through formal schooling and college before stepping into the family business. Adani left school early and learned by doing, managing trade and operations from a young age. Looking at how they learned, what shaped their early decisions, and how their education, formal or practical, set the stage for their empires tells a lot about the different ways people can prepare for big challenges.Mukesh Ambani was born on April 19, 1957, in Aden, which is now part of Yemen. His family returned to India when he was still a baby. He did his primary schooling at Scindia School, Gwalior, and completed his senior secondary education at Hill Grange High School in Mumbai along with his brother Anil.After school, he went to St. Xavier’s College in Mumbai and then earned a Bachelor’s degree in Chemical Engineering from the Institute of Chemical Technology. He joined an MBA program at Stanford University, but left in 1980 to help his father with Reliance Industries . His education gave him a base in technical knowledge and exposed him to teachers and mentors who made him think about problems differently.Those lessons came in handy when he oversaw projects like the Jamnagar refinery and later, the expansion of Reliance into telecommunications and digital networks.Gautam Adani was born on June 24, 1962, in Ahmedabad, Gujarat. He went to Sheth Chimanlal Nagindas Vidyalaya school, but left at 16. College was not part of his story. He moved to Mumbai as a teenager to work as a diamond sorter, and that’s where he got his first taste of business.By 1981, he returned to Ahmedabad to manage his elder brother’s plastics business. That experience taught him how imports, exports, and supply chains worked. It also became the starting point for the Adani Group , which he founded in 1988. Adani learned on the job. Every decision, every risk, and every deal was a lesson. There were no books or classrooms. The challenges themselves became the school, and the lessons stuck.Ambani and Adani took very different paths, but both led to the same destination: running massive businesses with influence across industries. Ambani’s education was structured, giving him knowledge, guidance, and a way to approach problems. Adani’s learning was direct and hands-on. He had to figure things out while they were happening.Formal education gives frameworks and networks. Experiential learning builds judgment and the ability to adapt quickly. Ambani combined both. Adani relied entirely on experience. Both worked, and both created businesses that dominate their sectors.It depends on how you look at it. Ambani’s education is impressive in a traditional sense—engineering from a top institute, exposure to an international MBA program, and structured learning. Adani’s is impressive in a different way—he learned fast, took responsibility, and built a business empire without formal training. Their stories show there is no single route to success.Ambani and Adani show two sides of the same coin. Ambani highlights the value of structured education and mentorship. Adani highlights the value of initiative and learning by doing. Both show that knowledge is important, but what matters more is how you use it. Students and young professionals can take one clear message from their journeys: learning never stops, and opportunities to learn come in many forms.","Mukesh Ambani went through formal schooling and college before stepping into the family business.

Inside The Buzz In Washington

Does it fit Trump's plan?



NEW DELHI: Only a few months back, Donald Trump had said that the US had lost India and Russia to the ""deepest darkest China"". Now, reports indicate he wants the States to join a new grouping with those very countries, and even bring Japan into it. However, no official confirmation has been made regarding this so far.An idea circulating in Washington this week proposed forming a “Core-5” bloc that would include China and Russia, bringing long-time rivals into the same framework and offering a clear contrast to the G7, Politico reported.""Nothing around a C5 or C7 was discussed, but there were certainly conversations that the existing bodies like the G-structures or the UN Security Council weren’t fit for purpose given today’s new players,"" the news outlet quoted a White House official who worked in the previous Trump administration saying.The report suggested the proposal for this group appeared in a longer, unpublished version of the National Security Strategy, referenced by Defense One, though this version couldn’t be independently confirmed by NatSec Daily. The White House firmly rejected the claim, with spokesperson Anna Kelly stating that no alternate, private, or classified version of the 33-page official strategy exists.Though such a plan once seemed unlikely, some observers say it fits Trump’s style.As the US president, he has often sought deals with rival nations, approving the sale of Nvidia’s H200 AI chips to China and sending envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner to Moscow for direct talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin.""This aligns with how we know President Trump to view the world, which is non ideologically, through an affinity for strongmen, and through a propensity of working with other great powers that maintain spheres of influence in their region,"" Politico quoted former director for European affairs on the National Security Council Torrey Taussig saying.The buzz comes at after Trump raised the tariff tensions, especially with the three nations — India, China and Russia, over trade disagreements and Ukraine war.It's not long back when he had posted a picture of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Russian President Vladimir Putin, and Chinese President Xi Jinping saying: ""Looks like we’ve lost India and Russia to deepest, darkest, China. May they have a long and prosperous future together!""The tensions seem to be easing out, but with a deadlock, as India and US are making efforts to finalise a bilateral trade deal.Moreover, PM Modi had a telephonic conversation with Trump on Thursday and the two reviewed ""bilateral relations and discussed regional and international developments.""""Had very warm and engaging conversation with President Trump. We reviewed progress in our bilateral relations and discussed regional and international developments. India and the US will continue to work together for global peace, stability and prosperity,"" PM Modi posted on X.","An idea circulating in Washington this week proposed forming a “Core-5’ bloc that would include China and Russia.

‘Anti-Sanatan’: Anurag Thakur attacks Tamil Nadu govt over Karthigai Deepam controversy; asks 'why are Hindus lathi charged'?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/anti-sanatan-anurag-thakur-attacks-tamil-nadu-govt-over-karthigai-deepam-controversy-asks-why-are-hindus-lathi-charged/articleshow/125930243.cms,"'Hindus Are Lathi-Charged': Anurag Thakur Attacks Tamil Nadu Govt Over Karthigai Deepam Row

NEW DELHI: BJP MP Anurag Thakur on Friday criticised the Tamil Nadu government over the Karthigai Deepam dispute, alleging that it has adopted what he called an ""anti Sanatan"" stance.Raising the issue in the Lok Sabha, the BJP MP said, ""I want to raise a very important issue where one state in India has become a symbol of anti-Sanatan Dharma. Their ministers are making statements against Sanatan Dharma. "" He added that devotees had been compelled to seek judicial intervention to access the temple.Thakur referred to the Madurai bench of the Madras high court, which recently pulled up the state government, accusing officials of ignoring its order on lighting the Karthigai Deepam lamp at Madurai's Thiruparankundram temple. He said, ""People were forced to approach the court to reach the temple. The Madurai bench of the Madras High Court came down strongly on the Tamil Nadu government, accusing officials of deliberately ignoring its order on lighting the Karthigai Deepam lamp at Madurai's Thiruparankundram temple. ""The minister further alleged that devotees faced police action during the episode. ""Hindus are lathi-charged... Why are Hindus stopped?..."" he asked, pressing the government over the treatment of worshippers at the temple.The Karthigai Deepam row escalated sharply lastweek as the Tamil Nadu government again declined to comply with a Madras High Court order permitting the lighting of the ceremonial lamp at the Deepathoon stone pillar atop Thiruparankundram hills. This marked the second consecutive day of defiance, even as a division bench rejected the state’s appeal against contempt proceedings initiated for non-compliance.Tensions rose on the ground, with BJP state chief Nainar Nagendran and several party workers detained in Madurai during protests against the state government. Over 1,000 police personnel were deployed as security forces stopped petitioners and supporters from reaching the hilltop despite the court’s direction.Earlier, a bench of Justices G Jayachandran and K K Ramakrishnan dismissed the state government’s appeal, calling it an attempt to pre-empt contempt action. The bench upheld single-judge Justice G R Swaminathan’s order allowing petitioners to light the lamp at Deepathoon under CISF protection. The single bench had initiated contempt proceedings after officials facilitated lighting the lamp at Uchi Pillaiyar Temple instead of at Deepathoon as directed on December 1.Following the dismissal of the appeal, Justice Swaminathan resumed contempt hearings, set aside the prohibitory orders issued by the Madurai district administration, and again permitted the lighting of the lamp at the hilltop, this time under the protection of Madurai city police. The judge warned that if officials continued to ignore the order, “harsh consequences will ensue.” Officials again blocked access, citing public order concerns.Meanwhile, the Tamil Nadu government approached the Supreme Court seeking an urgent hearing on its appeal against the High Court’s orders. When mentioned before a bench led by Chief Justice Surya Kant, the court declined to provide an immediate listing, saying it would consider the request as soon as possible. The state argued that it had exclusive authority over temple rituals and customs under the Tamil Nadu Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Act of 1959, and said the High Court could not use contempt jurisdiction to intervene in matters of religious practice.Appearing for a caveator, advocate P V Yogeswaran criticised the state’s approach. He said the government was “repeatedly defying the HC’s orders” and “creating a drama” by filing an appeal to stall contempt proceedings. The High Court has maintained that its directions do not affect the rights of the adjacent dargah and has upheld the petitioners’ right to perform the ritual at the designated Deepathoon site.The state’s appeal in the Supreme Court describes the issue as raising broader questions about the limits of contempt jurisdiction, the autonomy of temple management, and the interplay between judicial orders and executive enforcement powers. It pointed to the district administration’s prohibitory orders issued around 6pm on December 3, at the same time Justice Swaminathan had directed that the petitioner be allowed access to the hilltop. The High Court division bench earlier observed that executive orders under Section 162 of the BNSS cannot override judicial directions and described the timing of the prohibitory orders as indicative of a “well-designed act” to avoid compliance.The division bench will hear related appeals from the Madurai district collector and temple authorities on December 5. Justice Swaminathan had earlier permitted petitioners, including Rama Ravikumar, to light the lamp at Deepathoon after dismissing the state government’s objections about the site’s proximity to a dargah and claims that the ritual had long been conducted at Uchi Pillaiyar Temple.","BJP MP Anurag Thakur criticises Tamil Nadu government over the Karthigai Deepam dispute.

Wall Street ahead! Market looks beyond big tech; goes old school for growth in 2026,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/wall-street-ahead-market-looks-beyond-big-tech-goes-old-school-for-growth-in-2026/articleshow/125958140.cms,"Rotation away from big tech?

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market and other asset classes given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)

As the new year approaches, a clear theme is emerging on Wall Street, the technology giants that powered the bull market may no longer dominate market gains.Strategists at firms such as Bank of America and Morgan Stanley are advising clients to look beyond the so-called Magnificent Seven, a group that includes Nvidia and Amazon and shift toward less popular sectors. Health care, industrials and energy are now among the preferred picks for 2026, Bloomberg reported.For years, Big Tech stocks were seen as a safe bet, backed by strong balance sheets and robust profits. But doubts are growing over whether the sector can continue to justify its high valuations and heavy spending on artificial intelligence.Tech stocks have surged nearly 300% since the bull market began three years ago, but recent earnings from AI-linked firms Oracle and Broadcom, which fell short of lofty expectations, have added to investor unease.At the same time, optimism around the broader US economy is building, encouraging investors to rotate into lagging segments of the S&P 500 at the expense of megacap tech. ""I’m hearing about people taking money out of the Magnificent Seven trade, and they’re going elsewhere in the market,"" Craig Johnson, chief market technician at Piper Sandler & Co told Bloomberg.""They’re not just going to be chasing the Microsofts and Amazons anymore, they’re going to be broadening this trade out,"" Johnson added.Signs of this shift are already visible. Investors are moving into undervalued cyclical stocks, small caps and economically sensitive sectors.Since US equities hit a near-term low on November 20, the small-cap Russell 2000 Index has risen 11%, while a Bloomberg gauge of the Magnificent Seven has gained roughly half that amount. Over the same period, the S&P 500 Equal Weight Index has outperformed the traditional, market-cap-weighted index.Strategas Asset Management expects this trend to continue. Chairman Jason De Sena Trennert said the firm sees a ""great sector rotation"" into this year’s underperformers, such as financials and consumer discretionary stocks, in 2026. Morgan Stanley’s research team echoed that view in its year-ahead outlook.""We think Big Tech can still do OK but will lag these new areas, most notably consumer discretionary, especially goods and small- and mid-caps,"" Michael Wilson, Morgan Stanley’s chief US equity strategist and chief investment officer told Bloomberg.Wilson said the broadening of market leadership could be supported by an ""early-cycle backdrop,"" following an economic trough in April. Such phases typically benefit cyclical sectors like financials and industrials.Bank of America’s Michael Hartnett said markets are already positioning for a ""run-it-hot"" strategy in 2026, rotating into "" Main Street"" mid caps, small caps and micro caps from Wall Street megacaps.Fundamentals appear to support the case for a broader rally. Earnings growth for the S&P 493, the index excluding the seven largest companies, is expected to rise to 9% in 2026 from 7% this year. Meanwhile, the earnings share of the top seven firms is projected to fall to 46% from 50%, according to Goldman Sachs.Still, some investors want more proof. Michael Bailey, director of research at FBB Capital Partners, said investors will look for confirmation that the S&P 493 can meet or beat earnings expectations.""If jobs and inflation data remain status quo and the Federal Reserve is still easing, we could see a bullish move in the 493 next year,"" he said. The Federal Reserve cut interest rates for the third straight time this week and signaled another reduction next year.","Investors are moving into undervalued cyclical stocks, small caps and economically sensitive sectors. Since US equities hit a near-term low on November 20, the small-cap Russell 2000 Index has risen 11%.

Chinese demand for foreign luxury cars is waning as customers opt for more affordable Chinese brand models, often sold at big discounts, catering to their taste for fancy electronics and comfort.That is bad news for European carmakers like Porsche, Aston Martin, Mercedes-Benz and BMW that have long dominated the upper reaches of the world's largest auto market.A slowing economy hits the luxury market A prolonged property downturn in China has left many consumers with little appetite for big purchases. Meanwhile, the well-to-do are becoming increasingly shy about publicly displaying their wealth, said Paul Gong, UBS head of China Automotive Industry Research.Many car buyers have been swayed by a 20,000 yuan ($2,830) trade-in subsidy offered by the Chinese government for purchasing electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles. People tended to purchase cheaper, entry-level cars where the discount will count more and those cars are mostly Chinese made, Gong said.""Slowing economic growth is one key driver behind weaker demand for premium cars,"" said Claire Yuan, director of corporate ratings for China autos at S&P Global Ratings, referring to a segment that typically counts car brands such as Mercedes-Benz and BMW.The market share of premium car sales in China, usually priced above 300,000 yuan ($42,400), more than doubled between 2017 and 2023 to about 15% of total sales, S&P said.That trend is now reversing. The share of premium cars sales fell to 14% in 2024 and to 13% in the first nine months of 2025, S&P said.Chinese automakers take a bigger bite While luxury auto sales have slowed, Chinese manufacturers, including electric vehicle maker BYD, have become more aggressive than many Western brands in technological innovation, frequently rolling out new electric vehicles and hybrids at cheaper prices, including premium vehicles, analysts said.""Their (Chinese carmakers') products are more competitive and more affordable even in the premium segment,"" Yuan said. ""That's why these foreign brands are gradually losing momentum.""The Chinese brands' share of passenger car sales climbed to almost 70% in the first 11 months of this year, according to China Association of Automobile Manufacturers. It reported Thursday that German brands held a 12% share, Japanese brands around 10% and U.S. brands nearly 6%.BYD already has overtaken Volkswagen as the biggest car seller in China in recent years. BYD is so far the best selling car brand this year in China for ""new energy vehicles,"" which include electric vehicles and hybrids, according to the China Passenger Car Association. BYD had cut prices of its electric and plug-in hybrid models by up to 34%, putting pressure on major rivals like Geely and Leapmotor.Mercedes-Benz's sales by units in China fell 27% from a year earlier in the July-September quarter, according to its latest earning report. The number of BMWs and its subsidiary-brand Minis sold in China dropped 11.2% year-on-year in the first nine months of 2025. Porsche and Aston Martin also cited pressure from weaker demand in China.Italian luxury carmaker Ferrari reported a 13% year-on-year drop in car shipments to mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan in January-September. It was the only region where sales declined during that time.Ola Kallenius, CEO of Mercedes-Benz, told investors in late October that ""hyper-competition in China is not going away anytime soon.""The ""market situation in the premium and luxury segment in China remained tense,"" the carmaker said.Used luxury cars going for cheaper The downturn in interest in luxury vehicles is hitting dealerships hard.Li Yi, a salesperson in charge of second-hand cars at a Beijing Porsche center, said a 2024 Panamera 2.9T with a mileage of about 20,000 kilometers (12,400 miles) was priced at 950,000 yuan ($134,300). The previous owner bought it for about 1.4 million yuan ($198,454).""It's mainly due to the sluggish economic situation,"" Li said. ""(It's) not only Porsche. Benz, BMW, Bentley and Rolls-Royce all face the same situation."" Porsche and Bentley are part of the Volkswagen group.At a used-car market in Beijing, four other car dealership representatives who spoke to The Associated Press described a similarly grim situation, with premium cars selling at significantly lower prices over the past year.China's monthly auto production in November surpassed a record of 3.5 million units for the first time, the CAAM reported Thursday, but domestic auto sales dropped 4% year-on-year under fading demand as some trade-in subsidies were halted in some regions.""Who still has money these days? People's pockets are cleaner than their faces,"" joked one used car salesperson who identified herself as Hao.Prices have been sliding for two years and she offers bigger discounts, said the salesperson, who did not give her full name as she was not authorized by her company to speak to the media.""Now they think hard before they spend,"" she said.","Chinese demand for foreign luxury cars waning as customers opt for more affordable Chinese brand models.

In a light-filled workshop in eastern China, a robotic arm moved a partially assembled autonomous vehicle as workers calibrated its cameras, typical of the incremental automation being adopted even across smaller factories in the world's manufacturing powerhouse.China is already the world's largest market for industrial robots, and the government is pouring billions of dollars into robotics and artificial intelligence to boost its presence in the sector.The first essentially humanlessfactoriesare already in operation, even as widespread automation raises questions about job losses as well as the cost and difficulty of transition for smaller and medium-sized companies.The answer for many is a hybrid approach, experts and factory owners told AFP.At the autonomous vehicle workshop, manager Liu Jingyao told AFP that humans are still a crucial part of even technologically advanced manufacturing.""Many decisions require human judgement,"" said Liu, whose company Neolix produces small van-like vehicles that transport parcels across Chinese cities.""These decisions involve certain skill-based elements that still need to be handled by people.""At the Neolix factory, 300 kilometres (186 miles) north of Shanghai, newly built driverless vehicles zoomed around a testing track simulating obstacles including puddles and bridges.In a closed-off room, workers assembled vehicles' ""brains"", testing their cameras and computer chips.""Automation... primarily serve(s) to assist humans, reducing labour intensity rather than replacing them,"" Liu said.But Ni Jun, a mechanical engineering expert at Shanghai's Jiaotong University, said China's strategy of focusing on industrial applications for AI means full automation is already feasible in many sectors.Among others, tech giant Xiaomi operates a ""dark factory"" -- where the absence of people means no need for lights -- with robotic arms and sensors able to make smartphones without humans.- Digital divide -Ni described a ""digital divide"" between larger companies with the funds to invest heavily in modernisation, and smaller businesses struggling to keep up.For Zhu Yefeng's Far East Precision Printing Company, part of China's vast network of small independent factories employing up to a few dozen people each, full automation is a distant dream.At the company just outside Shanghai, workers in small rooms fed sheets of instruction manuals into folding machines and operated equipment that printed labels for electronic devices.The company used pen and paper to track its workflow until two years ago, with managers having to run around the factory to communicate order information.""Things were, to put it bluntly, a complete mess,"" Zhu told AFP.The company has since adopted software that allows employees to scan QR codes that send updates to a factory-wide tracker.On a screen in his office, Zhu can see detailed charts breaking down each order's completion level and individual employees' productivity statistics.""This is a start,"" Zhu told AFP. ""We will move toward more advanced technology like automation, in order to receive even bigger orders from clients.""Financial constraints are a major barrier though.""As a small company, we can't afford certain expenses,"" said Zhu.His team is trying to develop its own robotic quality testing machine, but for now humans continue to check final products.- Employment pressures -The potential unemployment caused by widespread automation will be a challenge, said Jacob Gunter from the Berlin-based Mercator Institute for China Studies.""Companies will be quite happy to decrease their headcount... but the government will not like that and will be under a lot of pressure to navigate this,"" Gunter told AFP.Beijing's push to develop industrial robots will ""intersect with the need for maintaining high employment at a time when employment pressure is considerable"", he added.Going forward, manufacturers must strike a balance ""between the technical feasibility, social responsibility, and business necessity"", Jiaotong University's Ni told AFP.Zhou Yuxiang, the CEO of Black Lake Technologies -- the start-up that provided the software for Zhu's factory -- told AFP he thought factories would ""always be hybrid"".""If you ask every owner of a factory, is a dark factory the goal? No, that's just a superficial description,"" Zhou said. ""The goal for factories is to optimise production, deliver things that their end customers want, and also make money.""",China is already the world's largest market for industrial robots.

Venezuela's oil exports shrivel as US seizes tanker off its coast,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/venezuelas-oil-exports-shrivel-as-us-seizes-tanker-off-its-coast/articleshow/125951065.cms,"China, Russia SLAM Trump After U.S. Military 'HIJACKS' Oil Vessel Off Venezuela

CARACAS: Venezuela's oil exports have plummeted since the US seized an oil tanker off the country's coast this week and imposed new sanctions on shipping companies doing business with the embattled Latin American country, Al Jazeera reported.Oil tanker movements into and out of Venezuelan waters have almost come to a standstill, Al Jazeera's sources stated, after the US announced that it would seize more vessels as part of its military pressure on Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro.The seizure on Wednesday of the Skipper tanker marked the first US capture of Venezuelan oil cargo since Washington imposed sanctions on Caracas in 2019. It also comes amid a US military build-up in the Caribbean, which appears designed to remove Maduro from power.Threats of more seizures have now left tankers - loaded with about 11 million barrels of oil and fuel - stuck in Venezuelan waters and fearing to venture further, according to data and documents cited by Al Jazeera's sources.Only tankers chartered by US oil giant Chevron have left ports and sailed into international waters carrying Venezuelan crude since the seizure of the Skipper, according to Reuters. Chevron has US government authorisation to operate in Venezuela through joint ventures with state-run oil company PDVSA and can export its oil to the US.Chevron confirmed this week that it was operating in Venezuela ""without disruption and in full compliance with laws and regulations applicable,"" and had exported two cargoes of Venezuelan heavy crude to the US since the seizure of the Skipper.As the Skipper was taken to Houston, Texas, on Friday for the unloading of its confiscated fuel cargo, Trump reiterated that the US military will start carrying out strikes on land against drug trafficking targets in Latin America, as per Al Jazeera.Speaking at the White House, Trump said that US forces - which have been attacking vessels in the Caribbean Sea and Pacific Ocean for weeks, killing some 90 people - had stopped 96 percent of drugs trafficked to the US by water.The US also claims it is attacking drug trafficking vessels but has provided no evidence, while international law experts say the attacks amount to extrajudicial killings by Washington in international waters.","Venezuela's oil exports have plummeted since the US seized an oil tanker off the country's coast this week.

Commodities market: Copper prices surge 35% this year — What led the rally?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/commodities-market-copper-prices-surge-35-this-year-what-led-the-rally/articleshow/125947411.cms,"Copper markets are witnessing a sharp rally as the red metal edges closer to the $12,000-a-metric-ton level, driven by rising demand from AI-led data infrastructure and growing concerns over supply constraints beyond the United States.So far this year, prices have surged 35%, putting the metal on course for its strongest annual performance since 2009. Earlier on Friday, the metal briefly climbed to $11,952 a ton, buoyed by disruptions in mining output and a wave of stockpiling in the US.Appeal for copper’s lies in its unmatched electrical conductivity, making it indispensable for power grids that support data centres, electric vehicles and clean energy infrastructure. Billions of dollars are being poured globally into modernising electricity networks, with data centres and renewable energy projects requiring massive and sustained power supply, Reuters reported.Investor appetite has also grown as artificial intelligence reshaped commodity strategies. “Investors who want a broad basket of AI interests will also buy into financial products which include hard assets that feed into data centres,” said Benchmark Mineral Intelligence analyst Daan de Jonge.“Investors will buy copper-related assets such as ETFs.”That shift has been reflected in new investment vehicles. Canada’s Sprott Asset Management rolled out the world’s first physically backed exchange-traded copper fund in mid-2024. The fund, which holds close to 10,000 tons of physical copper, has jumped nearly 46% this year, trading at almost 14 Canadian dollars per unit.Supply pressures remain a key concern. A survey by Reuters indicated that copper market will run a deficit of 124,000 tons this year, expanding to 150,000 tons in 2026.Production setbacks have further added to the strain, including an accident at Freeport McMoRan’s Grasberg mine in Indonesia in September. Major miners such as Glencore have also lowered their production guidance for 2026.Despite rising supply concerns, copper inventories across global exchanges have increased. Combined stocks held at the London Metal Exchange, Comex in the US and the Shanghai Futures Exchange are up 54% this year at 661,021 tons. Much of that metal has been funnelled into the US, where higher prices on Comex have drawn shipments since March ahead of planned import tariffs announced by US President Donald Trump, Reuters reported.Comex inventories have reached a record 405,782 tons, now accounting for 61% of total exchange-held copper, compared with just 20% at the start of 2025. “It feels incredibly tight because all of this material is going to the US,” de Jonge said.Refined copper was excluded from the 50% import tariffs that took effect on August 1, though US duties on the metal remain are still subjected to review, and an update is expected by June.Meanwhile, the outlook remains firm on the demand front. Global energy transition, including wind and solar technologies, is also expected to significantly lift copper consumption. Macquarie estimates global demand will reach 27 million tons this year, up 2.7% from 2024. Demand in China is projected to grow 3.7%, while consumption outside China is forecast to rise 3% next year.“Bullish sentiment is being driven by the narrative around tight supply, supported by macro news flows,” said Macquarie analyst Alice Fox.","So far this year, prices have surged 35%, putting the metal on course for its strongest annual performance since 2009.

‘Trillions incoming’





Government stakes and market gains



'The richest country'

Trump’s work in US promise



Why do numbers fail to add up?





A messaging gap in the ‘windchill economy’





US President Donald Trump has often pointed to rising government revenues and sweeping investment pledges as proof that his economic strategy is working. However, many Americans, struggling with rising bills, have failed to see this growth materialising.Critics have also argued that the president is talking past households dealing with day-to-day affordability pressures, CNN reported.The disconnect is most visible in what economists describe as a “windchill economy,” a period where headline growth looks healthy, but personal finances feel strained. In the US, while Trump has emphasised strong numbers and future gains, the immediate cost-of-living squeeze remains unresolved for millions.At the heart of Trump’s economic pitch are two claims he repeats frequently: that trillions are flowing into the US because of the ‘tariffs’ and that major corporations have committed trillions of dollars in investment to the American economy.“Let me tell you about the real economy,” Trump told Politico, earlier this week, when asked about affordability.“We’ve got $18 trillion coming into our country.Biden had less than $1 trillion in four years.”Although the president’s figures are widely regarded as overstated, tariff collections have risen by more than $200 billion during Trump’s term compared with the previous administration. At the same time, several companies and foreign governments have announced short- and long-term investment plans in the US, with the total value of pledges running into the trillions of dollars.Trump has also highlighted the launch of a new $1 million “Gold Card” visa programme this week, which he says will bring billions of dollars into the country. Commerce secretary Howard Lutnick has said the scheme could raise up to $1 trillion for the US Treasury.Beyond tariffs and visas, Trump has pointed to direct government investments in companies deemed critical to national security. His administration has committed billions of taxpayer dollars to such firms, arguing that the strategy strengthens both the economy and national interests.Because of stock market gains, Trump has said those investments are already increasing in value. Referring to the administration’s 10% stake in Intel, he said, “The price went through the roof. I made $40 million dollars. Nobody talks about that.”The administration’s broader argument is that rising and promised revenues could finance major policy initiatives, including Trump’s proposed $2,000 stimulus cheques and the large tax cut passed earlier this year. Trump has also claimed that tariff revenue could eventually replace income taxes altogether.Officials have gone further, suggesting that sustained tariff income could help pay down the national debt. The US paid $1.2 trillion last year simply to service its debt, which now stands at about $38 trillion, more than the country’s total economic output, according to CNN. Lowering the debt, the administration argues, would reduce interest costs and free up funds for programmes that support affordability.Trump has cited the recent $12 billion bailout for farmers as proof of concept. “We’ve taken in so much money with the tariffs now that it’s such a pleasure,” he said, as cited by CNN. “Without it, we wouldn’t be able to help you. We’re the richest country in the world now.”Trump has also linked investment pledges and tariffs to job creation, particularly in manufacturing and artificial intelligence. He has argued that higher trade barriers are encouraging companies to bring factories and workers back to the US.“Car companies are moving back that left us years ago. AI is coming in at levels never seen before. Factories are opening up all over the country,” Trump told Politico. “Ultimately, you know what it reduces itself to? Jobs. You’re going to have jobs like you’ve never seen in the United States.”Economists and critics say the financial reality does not support the scale of Trump’s claims. While an extra $200 billion in tariff revenue is substantial, it represents a small share of a $30 trillion economy. It is not enough to fund nationwide stimulus payments, eliminate income taxes or significantly reduce a $38 trillion debt.Investment pledges, meanwhile, are not binding. Companies have a history of announcing high-profile projects alongside presidents only to later scale them back or abandon them altogether. Much of the headline investment value also includes commitments that pre-date Trump’s involvement, according to CNN.Even if all the promised projects move forward, factories across the US are already struggling to find workers, and automation has played a major role in the long-term decline of manufacturing jobs.There is also evidence that tariffs are adding to, rather than easing, cost pressures. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said on Wednesday that Trump’s tariffs are solely responsible for inflation running above the Fed’s 2% long-term target this year.That reality undercuts the administration’s argument that tariffs will improve affordability in the near term, especially for households already squeezed by higher prices.The political challenge for Trump lies in the gap between strong economic indicators and lived experience. While he can point to growth and consumer spending, those figures carry little weight for people who struggle to pay their bills at the end of the month.By focusing on future gains and dismissing the affordability squeeze as a “con job” or a “scam”, Trump has made his task harder. His language reflects that of a business executive, where rising revenue signals success.But for many Americans, the economy is not about balance sheets or long-term projections, it is about whether they can afford to live right now.","US President Donald Trump has often pointed to rising government revenues and sweeping investment pledges as proof that his economic strategy is working.

The agreement aims to assess the feasibility of digitising Pakistan’s assets — including government bonds, treasury bills, commodity reserves and other federally owned holdings — through blockchain platforms.According to the ministry, the proposed collaboration seeks to “enhance liquidity, transparency and international market accessibility,” with any move subject to Pakistani laws, policies and regulatory approvals. The MoU is non-binding, sets no exclusivity, and does not amount to a procurement commitment. Definitive agreements, if pursued, will be negotiated within six months.Officials said the arrangement could allow Binance and its affiliates to provide technical expertise, advisory support, training and capacity building to help Pakistan evaluate compliant blockchain infrastructure that can attract global investors while ensuring full sovereign control.Calling the MoU a major signal of the government’s reform direction, Aurangzeb said, “This is a very strong message — not only for Pakistan, but for the entire world. What we have signed today reflects a long-term partnership… The next step for us is execution, and we are fully committed to delivering results with speed and quality.”Advisor to the Pakistan Crypto Council Changpeng Zhao, who was present at the signing, termed the development “a landmark” for Pakistan’s financial future. “This is a great signal for the global blockchain industry and for Pakistan… now we can move towards full deployment and execution,” he said, expressing confidence that the collaboration would have “positive and lasting outcomes for the economy.”The ministry added that the initiative marks a key milestone in aligning Pakistan’s financial ecosystem with global best practices at a time when tokenisation is gaining traction worldwide.Separately, the Pakistan Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (PVARA) said it has issued No Objection Certificates to Binance and HTX, launching a phased, FATF-aligned route toward full licensing. “Strong governance, AML and CFT compliance remain central as Pakistan builds a trusted digital asset ecosystem,” PVARA said on X.The authority said Pakistan has taken a “decisive step” toward a regulated digital-asset framework by entering formal arrangements with Binance and HTX.","Pakistan signs MoU with global crypto exchange Binance to explore tokenisation of sovereign and real-world assets of up to $2 billion.

US compliance alert: New York warned of $73M fund loss; federal audit flags improper immigrant commercial licences,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-compliance-alert-new-york-warned-of-73m-fund-loss-federal-audit-flags-improper-immigrant-commercial-licences/articleshow/125937827.cms,"Photo credit- AP

The US Transportation Department has warned New York that it could lose $73 million in federal highway funds after an audit found thousands of immigrant commercial driver’s licences (CDLs) were allegedly issued without proper verification, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said on Friday, AP report.Duffy said federal investigators reviewed 200 non-domiciled commercial licences and found more than half had been issued improperly, including several that defaulted to an eight-year validity period regardless of when the applicant’s work authorisation expired. He also said New York could not demonstrate immigration-status verification for roughly 32,000 active licences in this category and, in some cases, issued CDLs despite applicants’ work permits already having lapsed.“When more than half of the licences reviewed were issued illegally, it isn’t just a mistake — it is a dereliction of duty by state leadership. Gov. (Kathy) Hochul must immediately revoke these illegally issued licences,” Duffy said. New York has 30 days to respond to the findings.The New York Department of Motor Vehicles rejected the allegations. DMV spokesperson Walter McClure said: “Secretary Duffy is lying about New York State once again in a desperate attempt to distract from the failing, chaotic administration he represents.Here is the truth: Commercial Drivers Licenses are regulated by the Federal Government, and New York State DMV has, and will continue to, comply with federal rules. ”Duffy has launched a nationwide audit of immigrant CDL issuance following a fatal Florida crash involving a driver who was not authorised to be in the US. So far, only states led by Democratic governors have been warned of potential sanctions, though Duffy insisted the effort is not political and is focused on preventing unqualified drivers from operating heavy trucks and buses.The Transportation Department has already pressured California, Pennsylvania and Minnesota, where audits uncovered similar issues, prompting California to revoke 17,000 licences. A separate federal rule that sought to sharply restrict eligibility for noncitizens to obtain CDLs has been put on hold by a court.Immigrants constitute around 20% of US truck drivers, although non-domiciled licence holders account for only about 5% of CDL holders nationally.",US Transportation Department warns New York it could lose $73 million in federal highway funds.

"US rental aid update: Section 8 landlord payments resume after shutdown delay; $1,500 checks begin rolling out",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-rental-aid-update-section-8-landlord-payments-resume-after-shutdown-delay-1500-checks-begin-rolling-out/articleshow/125934567.cms,"Section 8 payments delayed but now restarting

How much landlords typically receive

FAQs

Q1. When will Section 8 landlord payments be sent out?

Q2. Why were the $1,500 landlord payments delayed?

Americans are being advised to monitor their bank accounts as landlord subsidy payments of up to $1,500 under the Section 8 rental assistance programme begin to roll out, following delays triggered by the recent federal government shutdown, according to an ET report.The payments, formally known as Housing Assistance Payments, support low-income households, seniors and people with disabilities by covering a portion of their rent, The Sun reported.Under the Housing Choice Voucher Programme, tenants typically contribute about 30% of their adjusted monthly income toward rent and utilities, while the remaining portion is paid directly to landlords by the local Public Housing Authority (PHA). Earlier this month, the US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) warned PHAs that December disbursements would be delayed due to the temporary shutdown-induced funding disruption.In New York City, the housing authority confirmed that it has now received the required December funds and will begin issuing payments. “Following notice from HUD that payments to Section 8 landlords would be delayed this month, NYCHA is happy to report that it has now received full funding from HUD and will promptly process payments,” the agency said in a statement.Created under the Housing and Community Development Act of 1978, Section 8 allows eligible low- and moderate-income families to rent homes in the private market. Tenants typically do not pay more than 40% of their adjusted monthly income toward their share of rent, as cited by The Sun. The PHA then issues the Housing Assistance Payment to the landlord, covering the gap between the tenant’s contribution and the contract rent.NYCHA said: “NYCHA’s Section 8 payments to landlords are contingent on federal funding, with the Authority serving as a pass-through for Housing Assistance Payments. It is NYCHA’s standard procedure to pay its Section 8 landlords as soon as is reasonably practicable following its receipt of funding from HUD.” The authority expects to begin sending out December’s payments on Monday, December 8.The Housing Assistance Payment varies depending on the tenant’s income, the rent level and the size of the unit. In New York, the typical subsidy ranges between $1,200 and $1,500 per month per unit, with the average at $1,466 as of November 2024 data from the New York State Comptroller. Landlords of larger or higher-rent units may receive higher amounts.While NYC landlords await their Section 8 payments, The Sun also reported that families in other states have begun receiving a one-time $750 holiday support payment. Another recent case highlighted a couple who bought a four-bedroom home using a “free money” housing grant that does not require repayment, with similar programmes available for other eligible applicants.Payments will begin going out from December 8, after HUD released the delayed funds.They were delayed due to the temporary federal government shutdown, which disrupted HUD’s December funding cycle.","Payments will begin going out from December 8, after HUD released the delayed funds.

The TerraUSD scam: South Korean entrepreneur Do Kwon faces 15 year jail time; what was the 'epic fraud'?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/the-terrausd-scam-south-korean-entrepreneur-do-kwon-faces-15-year-jail-time-what-was-the-epic-fraud/articleshow/125930611.cms,"Do Kwon, a cryptocurrency entrepreneur once celebrated for building the TerraUSD and Luna digital tokens, is now beginning a 15-year stretch in a US federal prison.But how did the South Korean businessman ended up with a jail sentence?The 34-year-old, who co-founded Singapore-based Terraform Labs and promoted his coins as stable, innovative and built for turbulent markets, returned to a Manhattan courtroom on Thursday to hear the punishment for a collapse that upended the crypto world. Prosecutors said he repeatedly misled investors, concealed the real mechanisms supporting his projects, and set off a chain reaction of losses across the industry.US district judge Paul A Engelmayer, sentencing him in New York, delivered a scathing assessment of the damage left behind. “This was a fraud on an epic, generational scale. In the history of federal prosecutions, there are few frauds that have caused as much harm as you have, Mr. Kwon,” he told the packed courtroom, further describing the crime as an ""epic fraud.""Kwon, dressed in yellow prison clothes, acknowledged the weight of the letters submitted by hundreds of investors who described losing their savings, futures and financial security when TerraUSD and Luna imploded. “All of their stories were harrowing and reminded me again of the great losses that I’ve caused. I want to tell these victims that I am sorry,” he said, as cited by Reuters.One of those victims, Ayyildiz Attila, said he had lost between $400,000 and $500,000. “My savings, my future, and the results of years of sacrifice disappeared. I struggled to keep up with payments and responsibilities, and everything I had worked for was erased,” Attila wrote.Kwon had earlier pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud and wire fraud, admitting that he misled investors about how TerraUSD regained its $1 peg in 2021. “I made false and misleading statements about why it regained its peg by failing to disclose a trading firm's role in restoring that peg,” he said at the time. “What I did was wrong.”Prosecutors said the restoration of the peg was not due to the “Terra Protocol”, the algorithm Kwon publicly cited, but through secret purchases by a high-frequency trading firm that had been arranged behind the scenes. They had urged the court to impose at least 12 years in prison, arguing that the crash triggered billions in losses and stirred turmoil across the crypto market. His lawyers had asked for no more than five so he could eventually return to South Korea, where he also faces charges.The January indictment listed nine criminal counts, including securities fraud, commodities fraud, wire fraud and money laundering conspiracy. In 2024, Kwon and Terraform also agreed to a $4.55 billion settlement with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, requiring him to pay an $80 million civil fine and barring him from crypto activity, Reuters reported.After the sentencing, his lawyer Sean Hecker said his client had spoken “from the heart”, expressed genuine remorse and hoped to continue making amends. US attorney Jay Clayton called Kwon’s conduct a calculated effort: he “devised elaborate schemes” to inflate token values and “fled accountability when his crimes caught up to him”.Under Kwon’s plea agreement, prosecutors will not oppose his request to be transferred abroad after serving half of his US sentence, but for now, the former crypto star faces a long spell behind bars.","Do Kwon, 34, sentenced to 15 years in a US federal prison.

Trump sanctions hit! Russia records lowest oil exports since Ukraine conflict; revenue falls to $11 billion,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/trump-eu-sanctions-hit-russia-records-lowest-oil-exports-since-ukraine-conflict-revenue-falls-to-11-billion/articleshow/125929247.cms,"Trump Turns Up Heat On Zelensky, Warns Of WW3; 'Give Me Security,' Demands Ukraine President

Urals crude prices plunge



Impact of Ukrainian strikes and Russia’s “shadow fleet”



Russia’s budget under strain



US escalates pressure with tariffs and sanctions



Global supply slips

Outlook — What will happen in the oil sector?



Russia’s oil exports crashed to their lowest point since the Ukraine war began, weighed down by buyers moving away from Moscow amid tightened US sanctions and Kyiv’s escalating attacks. In its latest assessment, the International Energy Agency (IEA) noted that Russian oil exports declined by 420 kb/d in November, pulling total shipments down to 6.9 mb/d.The drop in volumes and weakening prices pushed Moscow’s oil revenue down to $11 billion, which is $3.6 billion less than the same month last year. The IEA added that both export volumes and prices have dropped, “dragging export revenues to their lowest since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.”As exports dragged down, Urals crude prices also tumbled by $8.2/bbl to $43.52/bbl (one barrel is about 159 litres). This marked the lowest level since the start of the Ukraine conflict in February 2022.According to the IEA, this downturn pushed export revenues to their lowest monthly level since the invasion began.The IEA said Ukrainian attacks on Russia’s sanctions-busting “shadow fleet” and marine oil facilities cut almost half of Russia’s November seaborne exports through the Black Sea.The pressure on shipments and prices comes as Russia struggles with meagre economic growth, the accumulated impact of sanctions and Ukrainian strikes on its energy infrastructure.Ukraine intensified strikes on Russian refineries over the summer and early autumn, causing domestic petrol prices to spike and prompting some Russian regions to introduce fuel rationing.""After weathering significant unplanned refinery outages in November, tightness in refined product markets has eased, but sanctions in 1Q26 will provide fresh challenges,"" the IEA said.The Russian finance ministry reported that oil and gas revenues for the first nine months of the year were down 22% to $88 billion.A combination of high military spending, entrenched inflation and falling oil income has stretched Moscow’s budget. Russia is expected to post a $50 billion deficit this year, around three percent of GDP, and plans to raise taxes on consumers and businesses next year to narrow the gap.The United States has warned several countries that they may face additional tariffs and punitive trade measures if they continue buying Russian oil. The EU hasWashington recently imposed an additional 25% tariff on imports from India, citing its continued purchases of Russian crude. This was on top of the 25% tariff previously announced by US President Trump.In October, the US unveiled some of its toughest measures yet on Russia’s energy sector by sanctioning Rosneft and Lukoil, the country’s two biggest oil producers, in an effort to pressure Moscow to end the nearly four-year war in Ukraine.Global oil supply fell by 610 kb/d in November, extending cumulative declines from September’s record high of 109 mb/d to 1.5 mb/d, the IEA said.OPEC+ accounted for more than three-quarters of the overall drop, driven mainly by sanctions-hit Russia and Venezuela. The group contributed 80% of the supply decline over the past two months, reflecting major unplanned outages in Kuwait and Kazakhstan, alongside continued contractions in Russia and Venezuela.Among non-OPEC+ producers, the United States, Brazil and biofuels were also contributors to the global supply decline.Despite recent market tightness, the IEA projects global oil supply to grow by 3 mb/d in 2025 and a further 2.4 mb/d in 2026. However, the agency revised its supply growth forecasts downward, by 100 kb/d for 2025 and 20 kb/d for 2026 — to 106.2 mb/d and 108.6 mb/d respectively.On the demand front, world oil consumption is expected to rise by 830 kb/d in 2025, supported by improved macroeconomic and trade conditions. The IEA has also upgraded its 2026 demand outlook to 860 kb/d, an increase of 90 kb/d from earlier estimates.Gasoil and jet/kerosene are projected to account for half of this year’s demand growth, while fuel oil continues to lose ground due to substitution by natural gas and solar in power generation.","IEA: Russian oil exports declined by 420 kb/d in November, pulling total shipments down to 6.9 mb/d.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume.

Startups will play important role in helping India become 3rd largest economy: CEA Nageswaran,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/startups-will-play-important-role-in-helping-india-become-3rd-largest-economy-cea-nageswaran/articleshow/105332523.cms,"Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran





THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor (CEA) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran Udaan until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.Udaan built an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business still accounts for a very small part of India’s overall retail market but can balloon to $150 billion in sales and yield a 100% return on capital invested in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co. estimates published in the Mint newspaper.Bengaluru-based Udaan has also ventured into financing through its fintech unit which helps shopkeepers get working capital loans to buy inventory. That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says.

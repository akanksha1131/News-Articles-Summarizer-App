Stock market today: Indian equity benchmark indices, Nifty50 and BSE Sensex , ended in green on Tuesday after a volatile trading session. The NSE Nifty 50 index settled at 25,522.50, registering an increase of 61.20 points or 0.24 per cent after subdued trading. The BSE Sensex concluded Tuesday's trading session with a gain of 270 points, driven by late purchases in banking and select IT shares, alongside positive trends in Asian markets.The markets traded within a confined range for most of the session until value buying emerged near closing.

While sentiment remains cautiously optimistic about a potential deal, the lack of formal confirmation has restrained fresh buying activity.""Moreover, the US decision to extend the deadline for implementing 25% tariffs on key trading partners has led investors to adopt a more defensive approach,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Investments Limited, said.European markets displayed mixed trends, whilst US markets closed lower on Monday.Brent crude, the global oil benchmark, decreased by 0.59 per cent to USD 69.17 per barrel.According to exchange data, Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) purchased equities worth Rs 321.16 crore on Monday, while Domestic Institutional Investors (DIIs) acquired stocks valued at Rs 1,853.39 crore.","The NSE Nifty 50 index settled at 25,522.50, registering an increase of 61.20 points or 0.24 per cent after subdued trading.

Gold Price Outlook

Gold Price Weekly View: Sideways to Downside

Spot Gold could broadly trade in a narrow range of $ 3350 – 3270/oz (CMP $ 3310) till next week as most trade related uncertainties are seen easing now while US macro cues could remain in focus ahead.

On MCX this could translate to a trading range of Rs 97,650 – 95,230 / 10 gm in Aug futures contract.(CMP Rs 96,460 / 10 gm)

Gold price prediction today: Gold rates may continue to be range-bound as geopolitical tensions ease and optimism mounts on possible US trade deals with countries on the extension of tariff deadline to August 1, 2025. Over the next few days silver may be the preferred option compared to gold, say experts.Gold price continued to face hurdles near $3350 since last week after the precious metal edged lower since last week as the US June Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) report altered the US Federal Reserve (Fed) policy expectations.The US NFP came in stronger than expected, rising by 147,000 jobs in June from 144,000 in May (revised from 139,000). Additionally, the Unemployment Rate held steady at 4.1% in June. These reports indicated continued labor market resilience, reducing the possibility of the Fed’s near-term monetary accommodation. This, in turn, underpins the US Dollar (USD) and exerts some selling pressure on the non-yielding assets like Gold.On the other hand, renewed geopolitics saw Israel military attacking Houthi targets at three ports and a power plant in Yemen. Defence Minister Israel Katz confirmed the attack, saying they were carried out due to repeated attacks by the Iranian-backed rebel group on Israel. However the same failed to bring in additional upside in prices.Traders brace for the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) Minutes later on Wednesday for fresh impetus. Gold traders could also closely monitor the developments surrounding tariff policies amid renewed geopolitical tensions seen in the Middle East.Many major US trading partners are seen hurrying to secure deals, with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick telling reporters on Sunday that country-by-country tariffs will take effect August 1. While an interim accord with India was also expected to be reached, trade related uncertainties are seen easing in weeks ahead.US President Donald Trump’s consistent tariff threats have temporarily muted demand for the yellow metal while supporting the demand for the Greenback. The president has announced new tariffs on countries, with Japan at 25% and South Korea at 30% standing out. He has also given a new deadline, August 1, instead of July 9.Overall broad trend could remain sideways to cautious at higher levels amid Fed meeting minutes due Wednesday night could remain the next major trigger which may also provide clues on timing of rate cuts with most members seen to favor rate cuts starting September.On the other hand, Silver could remain a preferred bet for coming month as compared to gold as Silver-backed ETFs now stand at the highest since mid-2022, after enjoying net inflows for the past eight weeks witnessing the longest run in almost a half-decade","Spot Gold could broadly trade in a narrow range of $ 3350 – 3270/oz (CMP $ 3310) till next week.

Putin Gives Dollar Shock To Trump; Big Announcement On Ditching U.S. Currency In BRICS Speech

ANI

Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman held a series of high-level bilateral meetings with counterparts from Russia, China, Brazil and Indonesia in Rio de Janeiro, reaffirming India's commitment to strengthening cooperation with fellow Brics nations and key emerging economies.The discussions took place on the sidelines of the Brics finance ministers and Central Bank governors meeting.In her meeting with Russian finance minister Anton Siluanov, Sitharaman expressed gratitude for the support extended by President Vladimir Putin after the recent terror attack in Pahalgam.Both leaders reaffirmed the strength of the India-Russia partnership, with Sitharaman describing the relationship as one of ""exemplary mutual trust and understanding.""They reviewed bilateral financial sector cooperation and matters related to the New Development Bank (NDB).Sitharaman also met her Chinese counterpart, Lan Fo’an, where both sides discussed strengthening collaboration across sectors, rooted in shared civilisational links and expanding economic clout.According to the finance ministry's post on X, the two ministers recalled their last interaction in Samarkand in 2024 and agreed that India and China are “uniquely positioned to drive inclusive global growth and innovation.”Sitharaman emphasised that deeper engagement could amplify the voice of developing economies and help shape narratives aligned with the priorities of the Global South.In her discussion with Thomas Djiwandono, vice finance minister of Indonesia, Sitharaman reiterated India’s eagerness to host the next India-Indonesia Economic and Financial Dialogue.She thanked Indonesia for their solidarity following the Pahalgam attack and engaged on topics including Brics, UPI, RuPay, G20, FinTech, and financial markets,reported.During her meeting with Brazilian finance minister Fernando Haddad, Sitharaman discussed bilateral issues such as climate finance, COP30, and collaborative efforts in global institutions like the United Nations, WTO, Brics and G20.She appreciated Brazil’s leadership during its Brics Chairship and reaffirmed India's support for Brazil’s multipolar world agenda. India is set to take over the Brics Chairship in January 2026.The finance ministry said the two leaders emphasised furthering South-South cooperation and acknowledged the warm ties between India and Brazil. Sitharaman noted that the two countries are “strategic partners” collaborating across sectors.Earlier, Sitharaman also addressed the board of governors of the New Development Bank (NDB), where she underlined the importance of collective and decisive action by the Global South amid global fiscal and geopolitical uncertainties.She said multilateral development banks (MDBs) like the NDB have a vital role in tackling emerging challenges by offering “technical expertise, concessional financing, and effective risk mitigation tools.”The minister concluded that India's growing global role, especially within multilateral frameworks like Brics and the NDB, will continue to focus on pragmatic cooperation and inclusive development, particularly for the Global South.","Nirmala Sitharaman held a series of high-level bilateral meetings with counterparts from Russia, China, Brazil and Indonesia.

US trade deal: Donald Trump says more announcements coming Wednesday; 14 nations notified so far,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/trade-war-donald-trump-says-more-tariff-letters-coming-wednesday-14-nations-notified-so-far/articleshow/122330791.cms,"Donald Trump (File photo)

US President Donald Trump on Monday said his administration will release at least seven more tariff letters to trading partners on Wednesday morning, followed by more in the afternoon (local time), escalating tensions ahead of the looming August 1 deadline for a new round of reciprocal tariffs.In a post on Truth Social, Trump wrote, “We will be releasing a minimum of 7 Countries having to do with trade, tomorrow morning, with an additional number of Countries being released in the afternoon. Thank you for your attention to this matter!""The announcement follows Monday’s release of letters notifying 14 countries- including Japan, South Korea, and South Africa- of steep import duties, ranging from 25 per cent to 40 per cent. So far, Trump has posted letters targeting Japan (25 per cent), South Korea (25 per cent), Myanmar (40 per cent), Laos (40 per cent), South Africa (30 per cent), Kazakhstan (25 per cent), and Malaysia (25 per cent). Other countries named in the administration’s tariff strategy include Tunisia, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Cambodia, Bosnia & Herzegovina, Serbia, and Thailand- with tariffs ranging between 25 per cent and 36 per cent.In the letters, Trump accused several governments of maintaining “non-reciprocal” trade practices and warned that any retaliatory tariff hikes would prompt even steeper US duties. “Whatever the number you choose to raise them by will be added onto the 25 per cent we charge,” he wrote in similar messages to Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and South Korean President Lee Jae-myung.The president, however, signaled willingness to reconsider rates if countries offer improved trade terms. “These tariffs may be modified, upward or downward, depending on our relationship with your Country,” he noted.Trump's aggressive tariff campaign has drawn comparisons to his earlier trade war with China but differs in its broader sweep—covering nearly every region. While the administration touts this as a move to correct longstanding trade imbalances and boost US manufacturing, critics warn it could destabilize global supply chains and strain alliances.The policy has already stirred sharp reactions. Japanese Prime Minister Ishiba had said over the weekend that he “won’t easily compromise” on trade terms, signaling potential resistance from key allies.Back in April, Trump rolled out a sweeping 10 per cent tariff on most imports, branding it ""Liberation Day."" But following market jitters, he paused enforcement for 90 days to allow deal-making. So far, only Britain, Vietnam, and—tentatively—China have reached limited arrangements with Washington.The coming days are expected to be pivotal. Trump has promised that by July 9, most countries will have either received official correspondence or finalized agreements.","US President Donald Trump on Monday said his administration will release at least seven more tariff letters to trading partners on Wednesday.

MUMBAI: IPL, cricket's annual showpiece event, has seen its business value jump 13% in a year to $18.5 billion - nearly Rs 1.6 lakh crore.At the same time, its brand value has risen 14% to nearly $4 billion (about Rs 33,000 crore), a report by NYSE-listed investment bank Houlihan Lokey, which has valued several sports franchises around the world, showed.The year also saw 2025 IPL winner Royal Challengers Bengaluru taking the top slot in terms of brand value among the 10 teams that compete in the league. The first-time winner in the league's 18-year history has a brand value of $269 million.In the brand valuation table, RCB is followed by Mumbai Indians at $242 million, Chennai Super Kings at $235 million and Kolkata Knight Riders at $227 million.""IPL continues to redefine sports commercialisation - not just in terms of cricketing excellence but through record auctions, landmark sponsorships, technological advancements, and an ever-expanding international footprint,"" the report said about the league's recent expansions and business growth.Calling IPL ""a global phenomenon"" that is at the intersection of sport, entertainment, and commerce, the report said that the league's ""influence now extends far beyond the cricketing fraternity, reshaping fan engagement, commercial models, and the structure of the sport itself"".The report pointed out that IPL's success has also catalysed a proliferation of short-format leagues across continents, ""redefining the modern cricketing calendar and embedding itself as a cornerstone of contemporary popular culture"".The report by Houlihan Lokey also estimated that the advertising revenue during the 2025 IPL had jumped a massive 50% to about $600 million (about Rs 5,000 crore). And in terms of viewership, the final match between RCB and Punjab Kings recorded over 678 million views, a number that was higher than the India-Pakistan clash during the ICC Championship in Feb this year, the report said.On IPL's revenue model, the report said that it represented ""a near-perfect blend of predictable cash flows and cost discipline, a rarity in the global sports asset universe. ""Revenues are underwritten by BCCI's long-term, well-negotiated media rights contracts and front-loaded sponsorship deals, creating annuity-like cash flows.""For top franchisees, almost 80% of the costs are secured even before the tournament begins. ""On the cost side, the presence of a salary cap (Rs 120 crore per team) functions as an embedded margin protector, preventing wage inflation (a major concern for global sports teams) and ensuring competitive parity among teams.""In terms of costs and revenue models, IPL is seen to be superior to the English Premier League (EPL) of the UK and the National Basketball Association (NBA) of the US, the report noted. ""For institutional investors, this makes the IPL not just a sports league but a high-growth compounder in the entertainment space, catering to a fast-growing fan base with rising disposable income and a strong appetite for premium digital experiences.

A key emphasis was also placed on the necessity for e-commerce entities to disclose comprehensive details of all warehouses and storage facilities linked to their operations on the FoSCoS (Food Safety Compliance System) portal,"" FSSAI said in a statement. The possibility of displaying the date of expiry/use by for food products at the consumer interface was also discussed.The development comes at a time when quick commerce platforms have come under scrutiny over food safety violations. Last month, the Maharashtra Food & Drug Administration (FDA) department suspended food business licenses of Zepto's Dharavi dark store and another managed by Blinkit in Pune's Balewadi area over food safety lapses and regulatory non-compliance. The licences were reinstated following inspection by authorities and adherence to compliance by the platforms. Several brands have started tightening their terms of contract with platforms and are renegotiating clauses related to storage, handling, and hygiene with them following the instances, TOI had reported.","Food regulator FSSAI warned e-commerce platforms of ""severe action"" if they fail to comply with food safety protocols.

Electronics Manufacturing Scheme

Shift From China To Taiwan, South Korea

Indian electronics component manufacturers are fast shifting away from China’s firms. As applications for the electronics component manufacturing scheme approach their deadline, domestic contract manufacturers including Epack Durable, Micromax's Bhagwati Products, Dixon Technologies, PG Electroplast, Amber Enterprises and Optiemus are finalising their proposals, but with a catch!The firms are partnering with South Korean, Taiwanese and Japanese companies as equity stakeholders instead of Chinese firms, according to the CEOs of these Indian companies.This shift is notable because China previously dominated as the primary market for products, parts and business collaborations.

Such clearances will take a lot of time, impact our plans and incentive payout under the scheme,"" said a CEO of one of the largest players in the industry.In cases where technology is available from Taiwan and South Korea, it would be utilised, whilst Chinese dependency remains for other components. Negotiations are underway for technical partnerships or minor equity stakes, a source told the financial daily.Dixon Technologies, the country's leading smartphone contract manufacturer, is currently finalising partnership terms with South Korean and Taiwanese enterprises, according to Managing Director Atul Lall.

The initiative, allocated Rs 22,919 crore, spans across six years with an initial gestation period of one year.The programme seeks to establish a robust component ecosystem by drawing substantial investments, enhancing domestic value addition from its current 20% average, and facilitating the integration of Indian firms into global value chains.Official projections indicate anticipated investments of Rs 59,350 crore to generate products worth Rs 4,56,500 crore, creating 91,600 direct jobs and numerous indirect employment opportunities during its duration.

"Market watch: Asian stocks retreat as Donald Trump tariffs unsettle markets; oil slips amid supply, demand worries",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/market-watch-asian-stocks-retreat-as-donald-trump-tariffs-unsettle-markets-oil-slips-amid-supply-demand-worries/articleshow/122332020.cms,"Representative image (Picture credit: AP)

Asian equity markets slipped on Wednesday as rising global trade tensions, driven by fresh tariff threats from US President Donald Trump, dampened investor sentiment and triggered a cautious pullback from risk assets.A regional index declined for the third time in four sessions, led by sharp losses in Hong Kong, while copper and oil markets reflected the broader market unease.Hong Kong stocks fell as much as 1.2%, dragging the regional gauge down 0.3%. According to Bloomberg, shares in Japan rose modestly while Australian equities edged lower.Wall Street futures were also under pressure, with S&P 500 index futures down 0.1% after a muted Tuesday session.The latest market jitters stemmed from Trump’s renewed determination to impose a 50% tariff on copper imports and a looming threat to expand levies on pharmaceuticals and semiconductors. The US President made it clear that the August 1 deadline for reciprocal tariffs was final, saying, “No extensions will be granted.”Benchmark copper futures fell 1.7% in London, paring back Tuesday’s record rally on the Comex, where contracts had surged 17% after Trump’s announcement.The premium between New York and London prices ballooned to nearly 24%, highlighting supply dislocation fears. “The market’s response… has been one of indifference,” said IG Australia analyst Tony Sycamore as quoted by Bloomberg, warning that traders may only react sharply if hard economic data weakens or inflation accelerates.Oil markets also softened. Brent crude slipped 0.3% to $69.95 a barrel, while US West Texas Intermediate lost 0.4% to trade at $68.12.According to news agency Reuters, investors are trying to assess the impact of Trump’s trade policies on global demand. A record number of Americans, over 72 million, were expected to travel during the July 4 weekend, offering some hope for fuel demand.Supply-side developments also weighed on sentiment. The US Energy Information Administration cut its 2025 output forecast to 13.37 million barrels per day, down from 13.42 million bpd, citing reduced drilling activity.Meanwhile, OPEC+ is expected to greenlight a 548,000 bpd output boost for September.However, actual increases have fallen short so far, with Saudi Arabia shouldering most of the additions.Geopolitical risks added another layer of uncertainty. As per Reuters, four crew members on a Liberian-flagged bulk carrier were killed in an attack off Yemen, marking a second maritime security incident in a single day.With rising tariffs, mixed data from China, where factory deflation persisted and consumer prices unexpectedly rose, and inflation concerns in focus, analysts say volatility is likely to persist across global markets.UBS’s Ulrike Hoffmann-Burchardi was quoted by Bloomberg as saying that while tariffs are likely to stay elevated, they are not expected to trigger a recession. She advises investors to “phase into global equities or diversified portfolios” to ride out the turbulence.","Hong Kong stocks fell as much as 1.2%, dragging the regional gauge down 0.3%.

NEW DELHI: US President Donald Trump 's latest tariff announcements have resulted in fresh uncertainty, with buyers expected to go slow on new orders.While textiles exporters seem to have got an advantage over Bangladesh, which has been slapped with 35% duty by Trump, industry is keeping close tabs on India's bilateral trade deal with the US as the American president has claimed the agreement with Vietnam allows him to impose a 20% tariff, although there may be product-specific concessions.In any case, the final word is not out on where tariffs settle in the coming weeks, with countries, including Bangladesh, once again rushing to Washington to rebalance the equations.""We need to watch how tariffs move. Buyers are a little confused at the moment,"" said V Elangovan, managing director of Tirupur-based SNQS International. What is adding to the complications is China. ""Retailers have to fill their shelves. Last week, our merchandisers were in Shanghai, we could not compete because the Chinese were quoting better prices this year than last year. It is not clear how they can do so when the tariff for them is higher. We need more hand-holding from govt,"" he added.Govt and industry has been pushing for zero duty for garments and home textiles, where Indian products are competitive, although it is unlikely even if a trade deal is worked out as the Trump administration has refused to remove the 10% baseline tariff applicable on all countries.At 10%, Indian exporters are seen to be better off than rivals, provided subsidies are not doled out to Chinese manufacturers.In natural garments, where India has traditional strength, the cost disadvantage is relatively small, 3-4%. However, in synthetic garments, the gap widens to 10-11% due to higher production costs, Apparel Export Promotion Council (AEPC) said.""India, even with the existing reciprocal tariff rate (26% announced in April), will gain in export competitiveness vis-a-vis major garment exporting competing countries. Besides, we are quite hopeful of India striking a favourable trade deal which will further improve the competitiveness of India's apparel exports in all important US market... even a moderate reduction in the reciprocal tariff to around 15% could significantly improve our competitiveness across both natural and synthetic garment categories, thereby opening infinite export possibilities for India amid shifting global sourcing trends,"" said AEPC CEO Mithileshwar Thakur.With current tariff levels - India at 26%, Vietnam at 20%, and Bangladesh at 35% - India is seen to be competitive against Bangladesh in natural garments but faces pressure in the synthetics segment. ""It is looking good for us and a trade deal will help,"" said K M Subramani, president of Tirupur Exporters' Association.The big question is the ability of Indian garment makers to manufacture on a scale, especially given their reluctance to invest in capacity addition.","Textiles exporters seem to have got an advantage over Bangladesh, which has been slapped with 35% duty by Trump.

The United States has already collected $100 billion in tariffs this year, and the figure could triple to $300 billion by December, US treasury secretary Scott Bessent said on Tuesday during a Cabinet meeting chaired by President Donald Trump Trump, nodding in agreement, reiterated the administration’s firm stance, declaring that the real flow of tariff revenue would begin in earnest from August 1. “Money from tariffs to start coming in August 1,” Trump said. “Everyone has to pay, if they want to deal in the US,” he added.He also acknowledged the country’s existing trade imbalances.“We have trade deficit with a lot of countries,” ET quoted Trump.His comments came just an hour after announcing that no further extensions would be granted for the “Liberation Day” tariffs, which had initially been suspended in April, giving a 90-day halt, till July 9.“As per letters sent to various countries yesterday, in addition to letters that will be sent today, tomorrow, and for the next short period of time, TARIFFS WILL START BEING PAID ON AUGUST 1, 2025.There has been no change to this date, and there will be no change. In other words, all money will be due and payable starting AUGUST 1, 2025 — No extensions will be granted,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.Trump had previously hinted at some room for negotiations.Speaking at a dinner with Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu last week, he said, “I would say firm, but not 100 percent firm,” when asked whether the August 1 deadline was final. “I would say final, but if they call with a different offer, and I like it, then we'll do it.”However, by Tuesday, the tone had shifted. Trump confirmed that letters had gone out to over a dozen nations, warning that suspended tariffs would return at even higher rates.The new letters imposed 25% duties on Japan and South Korea, with up to 40% on other countries. Indonesia was told to expect 32% tariffs, Bangladesh 35%, and Thailand 36%. Several African and Southeast Asian nations also received notices, though countries like Laos and Cambodia saw lower-than-expected rates.Trump defended the tough measures, calling current trading arrangements “unfortunately, far from Reciprocal.” He warned that any countermeasures would lead to “further escalation.”The tariff push comes amid mounting pressure on Trump to deliver on his “90 deals in 90 days” pledge. So far, only two firm agreements, with Britain and Vietnam, have been confirmed, along with a limited easing of tariffs with China.He also threatened an additional 10% tariff on countries aligning with the Brics bloc, accusing them of pursuing “Anti-American policies” after the group criticised US protectionism at its 2025 summit.Diplomatic efforts appear to be ongoing, with the European Commission confirming that EU chief Ursula von der Leyen had a “good exchange” with Trump during a phone call on Sunday, indicating that behind-the-scenes talks may still be in motion despite the president’s tough public stance.","The United States has already collected $100 billion in tariffs this year, and the figure could triple to $300 billion by December.

Strong performance across key areas

Policy reforms fuel growth

A growing global workforce

The United Arab Emirates has been ranked the second most attractive destination for digital nomads in 2025, according to the latest VisaGuide Digital Nomad Visa Index, as reported by The Economic Times. The UAE moved up from fourth place in 2023, now surpassing countries like Montenegro, the Bahamas, and Hungary, with only Spain ahead on the list.The index evaluates countries based on criteria such as internet quality, tax environment, cost of living, healthcare, and safety, areas where the UAE continues to perform well. The rise reflects not just better amenities, but also a long-term national strategy focused on remote work, innovation, and infrastructure.The UAE’s improved ranking is attributed in part to its early adoption of remote work policies. In March 2021, the country introduced a remote work visa, allowing foreign professionals to live in the UAE while working for overseas employers. This initiative led to further programs, including Dubai’s Remote Work Visa and Abu Dhabi’s Virtual Working Programme.The digital nomad lifestyle has grown rapidly since the pandemic, with around 40 million people now identifying as location-independent workers.The global remote work economy is valued at $800 billion, and projections suggest that by 2035, up to one billion people could join the digital nomad workforce.According to experts, including Arab Digital Nomads platform founder Mohammad Alard, the UAE could strengthen its leadership by expanding affordable housing, promoting cultural assets, and building ties with global nomad communities, reported ET.","The United Arab Emirates has been ranked the second most attractive destination for digital nomads in 2025.

It’s unclear if that proposal is still active. Trump Media declined to respond to inquiries about the status of the earlier offering.The move comes as the SEC, under the Trump administration, unveiled updated guidelines last week aimed at easing the path for crypto ETFs. The regulator has also scaled back several enforcement actions against digital asset firms, part of a broader policy shift to position the US as a global hub for crypto innovation.Trump, once an outspoken critic of bitcoin, has pivoted sharply, receiving substantial financial backing from crypto firms. Ripple, whose token features in the proposed ETF, was among the top donors to Trump’s inaugural fund.This growing relationship has drawn sharp criticism from Democrats, who allege conflicts of interest and accuse Trump of using regulatory power to benefit family-linked ventures. Some crypto insiders, too, fear the close political ties could undermine efforts to legitimize the sector.At a recent press conference, Trump brushed off concerns, saying, “If we didn’t have it, China would,” and claimed credit for making the US “the world capital for crypto.”","Donald Trump's media company has filed for a new exchange-traded fund focused on five major cryptocurrencies.

A growing, assertive luxury market





A symbolic gesture





As Prada continues to face criticism over its Kolhapuri chappal-inspired sandals, the broader fashion world is grappling with how to engage with Indian aesthetics without falling into appropriation. The Italian label was called out on social media and by industry insiders for using a design closely resembling India’s traditional Kolhapuri footwear, without crediting the original artisans or cultural roots. The backlash has reignited long-standing concerns over luxury brands profiting from Indian heritage while erasing its origin stories.In sharp contrast, Louis Vuitton’s recent Spring/Summer 2026 men’s show in Paris is being hailed as a masterclass in how to collaborate with, rather than co-opt, Indian culture. As reported by The Economic Times, Pharrell Williams , LV’s Men’s Creative Director, drew deeply from his week, long trip to India in March, which took him to New Delhi, Mumbai and Jaipur. The result was an immersive runway experience at the Centre Pompidou on June 24, titled Paris to India.The show’s references were deliberate and credited. The Snakes & Ladders-themed runway was conceptualised by Indian architect Bijoy Jain. The music was scored by Oscar-winning composer AR Rahman. The collection incorporated Indian textiles and traditional silhouettes, presented with transparency about their sources.The timing is not coincidental. India’s luxury market is rapidly expanding, it’s valued at $17 billion and projected to hit $85 billion by 2030. Luxury houses including Dior, Gucci, and Valentino have already started designing India, specific collections or staging shows in the country. Dior’s 2023 pre-fall show in Mumbai, in partnership with the Chanakya School of Craft, was another notable example of this shift.Pharrell closed the show in a simple gesture that resonated with many. He walked the runway in track shorts, folded his hands in a namaste, and bowed. The collection itself reflected India’s diverse palette, with colours named turmeric, cinnamon, and ‘coffee indigo’. As Pharrell said backstage to fashion journal WWD, the collection was inspired by “the multifaceted sensibilities of present-day Indian sartorialism. ”","Luxury brands are grappling with how to engage with Indian aesthetics without falling into appropriation.

Minerals at the heart of the trade war

The price China still sets

Not a complete win for China

Deals, diplomacy, and control

US President Trump on Monday imposed a 25% tariff on imports from Japan and South Korea, while also announcing steep tariff rates for more than a dozen other countries. At the same time, he extended the deadline for implementing reciprocal tariffs on most trade partners until 1 August.Unlike other countries, China was not granted a tariff delay until 1 August. Instead, it has until 12 August to reach an agreement or face further import restrictions. The average US tariff on Chinese goods now stands at 51.1%, while China’s duties on US exports average 32.6%. Beijing has labelled the tariffs “bullying,” vowing to defend its interests.But as Washington attempts to reset its global trade strategy, experts say these measures cannot change a fundamental geopolitical reality: China continues to dominate the production, processing, and pricing of the critical minerals that power everything from electric vehicles to missile systems.Much of Trump's global economic strategy now hinges on a critical battleground: minerals. These resources from rare earths to cobalt and lithium are essential to everything from smartphones and batteries to missile guidance systems and jet engines.According to the South China Morning Post, the US relies on China for about 70% of its rare earth imports, making Beijing’s dominance in these materials one of its most potent forms of leverage.Economist Wang Xiaosong from Renmin University told SCMP that the strategic importance of these materials likely played a decisive role in pushing Washington to agree to a temporary tariff rollback in early May.China had retaliated to earlier US tariffs by placing more than a dozen strategic minerals under export control, effectively weaponising its dominance in the sector. “China will continue holding the cards for quite a while,” said analyst Vivek Y, as quoted by SCMP.Despite US efforts to diversify including projects in Brazil, Kazakhstan, and Greenland the reality remains stark: China processes 90% of the world’s rare earths and controls nearly 70% of their production.Even as Trump declares a ""national energy emergency"" to ramp up domestic mining, China retains a crucial edge in price-setting power.As The Atlantic reported, “When financiers determine the price for a ton of lithium, they turn to where those prices are set, which—thanks to China’s dominance—is typically in Asia.” In effect, even deals between companies in Texas and Quebec are often priced based on Chinese sales elsewhere.While Trump’s administration has encouraged partnerships with friendly nations like Australia, Canada and Brazil, efforts to create an integrated, alternative market have been inconsistent. “We’ve pissed everyone off,” said analyst Datta to The Atlantic, referring to how several allies are now hedging away from the US due to erratic tariff and trade moves.Meanwhile, China’s internal moves to expand mineral subsidies and exploration have only reinforced its long-term grip on the global market. At least half of China’s 34 provincial governments, including resource-rich Xinjiang, have increased mineral incentives, according to the Financial Times.Beijing’s export controls have not come without cost. As Times of India had earlier reported, the restrictions imposed in April in retaliation to US tariffs triggered a 75% plunge in Chinese rare earth magnet exports over two months. Global automakers were forced to pause production, and inventories piled up in Inner Mongolia’s Baotou exchange, which labelled the situation a “crisis”.Still, despite revenue declines and layoffs among smaller Chinese producers, China’s strategic calculus remains intact. Analysts suggest Beijing might even welcome a consolidation of its fragmented magnet sector. “I do not know if Beijing sees that as a bad thing, because further consolidation is helpful for controlling and understanding where materials go,” said David Abraham, professor at Boise State University, to Reuters.Ellie Saklatvala of Argus noted that “they have temporarily lost an important part of their customer base, with no certainty about when they will regain it.”In one of the more geopolitically significant moves, the Trump administration recently helped broker a peace agreement between the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda. While couched in diplomatic language, The Atlantic Council’s Tressa Guenov noted that “the deal hinges on what is by now a familiar theme with the Trump administration: access to critical minerals.”The DRC is a major source of tantalum, tungsten and coltan minerals vital to defence and tech industries and an area where China already holds major stakes. Any renewed US involvement will inevitably face competition, not just from Beijing but also from Russia, which has long sought influence in the region.",Much of Trump's global economic strategy now hinges on a critical battleground: minerals.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume.

Startups will play important role in helping India become 3rd largest economy: CEA Nageswaran,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/startups-will-play-important-role-in-helping-india-become-3rd-largest-economy-cea-nageswaran/articleshow/105332523.cms,"Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor ( CEA ) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran Udaan until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.Udaan built an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business still accounts for a very small part of India’s overall retail market but can balloon to $150 billion in sales and yield a 100% return on capital invested in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co. estimates published in the Mint newspaper.Bengaluru-based Udaan has also ventured into financing through its fintech unit which helps shopkeepers get working capital loans to buy inventory. That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says.

SAR imagery provides much higher resolution than other forms of remote sensing technology such as hyperspectral and multispectral. SAR is a critical technology for strategic reconnaissance and planning as well as for disaster management.According to Misra, winning the challenge in just over a year of floating the company is a major booster.He said L and P band SAR have an advantage over other frequencies (like X band) when it comes to penetration capabilities through rain, clouds, foliage and vegetation in a tropical country like India, and underground penetration capabilities in dry terrain.Continuing further, he said the L band SAR will provide 1 metre resolution, spotlight resolution in Stripmap mode. The current industry standard is 5-10 metre in L band. Misra said both the L and P band will operate simultaneously from a satellite borne SAR.

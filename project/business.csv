Gold Performance:

Spot gold traded between $3405 (August 11) and $3329 (August 14) in the week ending August 15. The metal was down 1.76% for the week, the first weekly loss after two straight weeks of weekly gain.

On August 18, spot gold fell nearly 0.1% to close at $3331 as investors monitored the high-stakes meetings in the US over the Ukraine war.

Trump-Zelensky, Trump-Europe meetings:

The Trump-Zelensky meeting at the Oval Office was concluded overnight. Talks centred around providing security guarantee to Ukraine. Later on, the US president Trump met with seven European leaders (Macron, Starmer, Meloni, Merz, von der Leyen, Stubb, and Rutte) who put forth a ceasefire as the first step towards achieving a lasting peace deal in Ukraine. They also insisted on a security guarantee to Ukraine. Trump has confirmed that there would be a trilateral meeting between Ukraine, Russia and the US. It is being reported that the Kremlin has agreed to the proposed meeting, but the date is not confirmed. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio will work with European allies and non-European countries on security guarantees for Ukraine.

US Dollar Index and yields:

The US Dollar Index swung between 97.62 (August 13) and 99.32 (August 11) in the week ending August 15. It registered its second straight weekly loss as it closed at 97.85 on Friday, down 0.30% for the week. At the time of writing, the Index was seen at 98.20, up around 0.03%% on the day as the Index gained upward traction ahead of the US FOMC minutes release to close around 0.3% higher at 98.17 on August 18.

US 10-year yields edged higher by 3 bps to 4.32% in the last week as 2-year yields fell by 1 bps to 3.75%, which steepened the yield curve. Ten-year yields were noted at 4.32% at the time of writing.

CFTC:

As per weekly CFTC data, money managers decreased their bullish gold bets by 7,585 net-long positions to 154,226 in the week ending August 12.

Fed Watch:

The Fed’s Bostic said after a 3-day tour of the Southeastern US he found that tariff strains were real and high borrowing costs were squeezing business profits. He is inclined towards reducing rates.

According to Financial Secretary Paul Chan of Hong Kong, the city plans to unveil a plan to develop an international gold trading centre which would include supporting physical delivery as the City’s plans to build a commodity trading system ecosystem progresses ahead.

Data roundup:

NAHB Housing Market Index (August) released on Monday came in at 32 Vs the forecast of 34.

Upcoming data and events:

Gold ETF:

Notwithstanding a 1.8% weekly decline in gold prices, total known global gold ETF holdings surged to a fresh 2-year high of 92.66 MOz on August 15. Gold ETF holdings are up 11.84% YTD. It is to be noted that ETF holdings reached a record high of 111.25 MOz on October 15, 2020, during Covid days on safe haven demand and fiscal and monetary stimulus measures taken by global central banks and governments.

USDINR:

USDINR fell as Trump held back on his further tariff threats. In addition, proposed changes by the Indian government in the GST structure, as announced on August 15, are also being seen as reducing tariff impact to some extent. The proposed changes will see the number of GST categories reduced from four to two, with most goods that were taxed at 12% and 28% now taxed at the lower rate of 5% and 18%, respectively.

Gold outlook:

In the very short-term, investors’ focus will be primarily on two factors: Geopolitical developments concerning Ukraine and Jackson Hole Symposium. The presence of seven European leaders at the meeting with Trump has lent some additional support to the cause of Ukraine. The proposed trilateral meeting may further alleviate geopolitical tensions to some extent in the very short-term; however, the mechanism of security guarantee and the stances of the major actors Viz Ukraine, Russia and Europe concerning each other remain sticky points. The Russian President Putin has clearly laid down the conditions of a ceasefire that include recognition of Eastern Ukraine’s Donbas regions won by Russia as Russian territories and demilitarization of Ukraine. Ukraine has maintained that it won’t cede its regions. Security guarantees by NATO may further complicate the situation in the region.

Thus, while gold, in ultra short-term, can test the support around $3307 ( MCX Gold October Rs 98,600)/$3290 (Rs 98,100) , downside is limited unless we see some significant and long-lasting positive developments in the Ukrainian war. Worsening US and global economies and rate cut expectations would cushion the fall in gold prices. Resistance is at $3350 (Rs 100,000)/$3375 (Rs 100,700).

India’s SHOCK Reply To Trump’s 50% Tariffs; Fires ‘Will PROTECT National Interests’ Warning

How India is looking to counter impact of US tariffs

Distress call from exporters

As India faces the threat of 50% US tariffs from August 27, the government is looking at sector-specific measures to cushion impact on exporters and small and medium enterprises. Indian goods exported to the US have been facing 25% tariffs from August 7, with an additional 25% penalty for India’s crude oil trade with Russia expected to be effective from August 27.These actions are vital due to the uncertainty surrounding the proposed bilateral trade agreement (BTA) negotiations. American trade negotiators have delayed their trip to Delhi for the sixth round of talks, initially set for August 25-29, despite both parties previously expressing their goal to finalize the first part of the BTA by autumn.The United States continues to be India's biggest trading partner. From April to July, India's exports to the US reached $33.53 billion, marking a 17.8% increase from $27.57 billion during the same period the previous year.Also Read | Trump’s 25% additional tariffs loom: Indian refiners delay orders for Russian crude oil; take cautious approach Officials have indicated that the government is considering targeted measures for specific industries instead of implementing a broad loan guarantee scheme to support export-oriented units and small and medium enterprises affected by US tariffs.This decision follows requests from exporters for an emergency credit line guarantee scheme (ECLGS) that would provide collateral-free working capital and government-backed risk coverage to mitigate the impact of the tariffs on Indian exports.“There have been cases where smaller firms, like in the textile sector, are not able to fully benefit from overarching schemes. That is why we are looking at targeted measures like sector-specific credit lines with relaxed collateral,” an official was quoted as saying.Additional measures under consideration include integrating lending infrastructure with the PM Vishwakarma scheme and the BharatNet project.Also Read | ‘Stop buying Russian crude oil’: Trump adviser says India should ‘start acting’ as strategic partner of US; ‘…it’s cozying up to Russia, China’ The PM Vishwakarma scheme offers collateral-free credit and skill training to artisans and craftspeople, along with other support measures.BharatNet is among the largest rural telecom initiatives globally, aimed at delivering high-speed broadband access to gram panchayats nationwide.""We are in discussions with banks and insurers about the potential to establish cluster-based working capital funds and reduce insurance premiums,"" the official stated.Also Read | GST rates to come down drastically! 99% of items in 12% bracket may move to 5%; here’s how you will benefit The Federation of Indian Export Organisations (FIEO) has advocated for credit assistance, risk management, and cost reduction to handle the challenges posed by the significant 50% tariffs announced by the US. They have also recommended a one-year moratorium on loan repayments, as the high tariffs might lead to decreased orders or extended payment periods, putting pressure on exporters' cash flows.The commerce and industry ministry is communicating with exporters and export promotion councils to evaluate the effects of the existing 25% tariff.FIEO has recommended reducing insurance premiums to make them more affordable for small and medium-sized exporters. Additionally, they have advocated for an automatic increase in credit limits by up to 30%, as exporters might require more working capital to remain competitive with international competitors.Also Read | Trump sees a ‘dead economy’ - but US-based S&P Global upgrades India’s credit rating - here’s why",The government is looking at sector-specific measures to cushion impact on exporters.

Air Canada strike: Restart plan suspended as union defies return-to-work order; prolonged standoff deepens travel chaos,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/air-canada-strike-government-ends-flight-attendants-walkout-services-to-resume-but-cancellations-linger/articleshow/123345627.cms,"Air Canada suspended its planned restart of operations on Sunday after flight attendants refused to comply with a government back-to-work order that they called “unconstitutional. ” The order had required them to return to duty by 2 p.m. ET (1800 GMT), but the union vowed to continue its strike, prolonging widespread cancellations and travel disruptions.Earlier today, Air Canada announced that it will restart flights on Sunday evening after the Canadian government intervened to end a strike by its 10,000 flight attendants that left more than 100,000 travellers stranded during the peak summer season.The airline, Canada’s largest, said it will take several days before operations return to normal and warned that some flights would remain cancelled over the next seven to 10 days until schedules stabilise.Federal Jobs Minister Patty Hajdu ordered attendants back to work less than 12 hours after they walked off the job at 1 a.m. on Saturday, citing the broader economic impact, AP reported.“Now is not the time to take risks with the economy,” Hajdu said, pointing to the unprecedented tariffs the US has imposed on Canada.The dispute has been referred to the Canada Industrial Relations Board, which extended the current collective agreement until a new one is decided by arbitration.The walkout had paralysed operations of the carrier, which runs nearly 700 flights daily. The shutdown was affecting about 130,000 passengers a day. Aviation analytics firm Cirium said Air Canada had cancelled 671 flights by Saturday afternoon, following 199 cancellations on Friday. Another 96 flights scheduled for Sunday were already suspended.The union had rejected Air Canada’s earlier request for government-directed arbitration, escalating the conflict. The government previously forced two major railroads into arbitration during a strike last year, a move unions challenged in court, arguing it weakened labour’s bargaining power. In this case, the Canadian Chamber of Commerce welcomed Ottawa’s intervention, and the Business Council of Canada had also urged binding arbitration.Hajdu stressed that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s Liberal government is “not anti-union,” but added it was clear both sides were at an impasse.Air Canada announced that passengers affected by cancellations would be eligible for full refunds through its website or mobile app. It also promised to arrange alternative travel with other Canadian and foreign airlines “where possible,” but cautioned that immediate rebooking could not be guaranteed as flights on other carriers were already full during the busy summer season.The airline and the Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE) have been negotiating for nearly eight months without success. Pay remains the most contentious issue. Air Canada said its latest proposal offered a 38% increase in overall compensation, including benefits and pensions, over four years, a package that “would have made our flight attendants the best compensated in Canada.”The union disagreed, arguing that the proposed 8% raise in the first year fell short of addressing inflation and raised concerns about the unpaid work flight attendants perform when aircraft are not in the air.","Air Canada flight attendants refused to comply with a government back-to-work order that they called “unconstitutional” The order had required them to return to duty by 2 p.m. ET (1800 GMT), but the union vowed to continue its strike, prolonging widespread cancellations and travel disruptions.

Union Minister Nitin Gadkari on Tuesday said the government’s aim is to make India’s automobile industry the number one in the world within the next five years.Launching a report prepared by The Express Industry Council of India (EICI) and KPMG, Gadkari said the outlook for the express industry is also promising.“The size of Indian automobile industry is now Rs 22 lakh crore... my aim is to make India’s automobile industry number one in the world in the next five years,” Gadkari said.The minister added that when he took charge of the transport ministry in 2014, the size of the sector was Rs 7.5 lakh crore, which has now grown to Rs 22 lakh crore. Currently, the US automobile industry is valued at Rs 78 lakh crore, followed by China at Rs 47 lakh crore and India at Rs 22 lakh crore.Gadkari said Prime Minister Narendra Modi ’s vision is to make India the world’s third largest economy, and the logistics sector will be key in achieving this goal. He noted that until recently, logistics costs in India were about 16% of GDP.“I want to share that, according to a joint IIM-IIT survey, we have brought this (logistics cost) down to 10 per cent. That is a major milestone and we are aiming to bring logistics cost down to single-digit soon,” Gadkari said.The minister attributed the reduction in logistics costs to significant investments in expressways and economic corridors.According to the report titled Powering India’s Economy, Connecting Business and Markets, the express industry contributes $1-1.5 billion in GST and $650 million in customs revenue annually.“The size of express industry sector is projected to double from $9 billion in FY25 to $18-22 billion by 2030, creating 6.5-7.5 million jobs,” it said.The report also noted that the express industry has evolved from being a logistics facility to becoming an essential service provider.

""By end of the year, we expect at least 10 distributors in each district of these states and at least 20 by next year,"" said Chalasani. Besides, tie-ups with leading academic institutions are in the offing to ""train the trainers"".AMFI has already partnered the department of posts to address legacy issues related to KYC of individuals, who did not have Aadhaar numbers seeded. The plan is now to extend it to training postmen as India Post revamps its operations, focusing on turning each of its verticals into a profit centre. If the move goes through, postmen will be like relationship managers in banks, who hawk savings products.For mutual funds nearly 45% of the investments are now coming from the bottom 30 towns, although overall 65% of the share is from the top 30 cities.Annually around 30,000 new distributors join the mutual fund industry but net additions hover around the 10,000-mark. While changing savings habits and online platforms have seen a surge in new investors into mutual funds, especially through systematic investor plans (SIPs), new distributors are seen to be critical in expanding the footprint to smaller towns and rural areas.There is a boom in mutual fund investments in the last few years resulting in the number of folios jumping from 2.1 crore in 2019 to 5.6 crore now. Chalasani said the target is to double it in the next few years.""Our campaign has created tremendous awareness and we will see a massive growth as there is a huge potential,"" he said, pointing to 80 crore bank accounts in the country.Currently, the assets under management in India are to the tune of 21% of GDP, compared to more than 100% in developed countries and 65% being the global average.",The Association of Mutual Funds of India (Amfi) is working with India Post to train nearly one lakh postmen as distributors.

NEW DELHI: Govt has waived customs duty on raw cotton imports for 40 days, seeking to cool prices and ease pressure on textile mills grappling with rising input costs due to the tariffs.The exemption, effective Aug 19 to Sept 30, removes the 5% basic customs duty and the 5% agriculture infrastructure and development cess. Govt said the idea was to enhance the availability of raw cotton in the domestic market and support export competitiveness of Indian textile products by lowering production costs.According to GTRI, India's cotton imports more than doubled in the previous financial year, surging 107% to $1.2 billion, compared with $579 million a year before.","The exemption, effective Aug 19 to Sept 30, removes the 5% basic customs duty and 5% agriculture infrastructure and development cess.

Optimistic rise

MUMBAI: The rupee recorded its biggest daily gain in a month, regaining the 86 level, with the domestic unit firming up 40 paise to close at 86.95 on Tuesday, up from 87.35 on Monday.The rally came on optimism that the U.S. may ease its stance on additional 25% tariffs after talks between Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelenskiy, raising hopes of a peace deal that could also reduce the likelihood of fresh sanctions on India's Russian oil imports.Domestic drivers also supported the currency, including stronger consumption trends and the government's plan to cut goods and services tax (GST) rates - the biggest such reform in eight years. Economists said the move could lift near-term growth momentum, improve sentiment and help revive foreign portfolio flows that had recently turned negative.The rupee further drew strength from a recent credit rating outlook upgrade for India, which has bolstered confidence in the economy. According to Jateen Trivedi of LKP Securities, the upgrade, along with reduced selling pressure from foreign investors and positive signals from India-Japan ties ahead of the Prime Minister's visit to Tokyo later this month, has helped improve sentiment, with the rupee expected to trade in a range of 86.60-87.25.Dilip Parmar of HDFC Securities noted that the Indian rupee outperformed Asian currencies due to risk-on sentiment, supported by growth-focused policies, renewed foreign fund inflows and a technical pullback. He added that the spot USD/INR rate is likely to find support at 86.80 and face resistance near 87.20 in the near term.","The rupee recorded its biggest daily gain in a month, regaining the 86 level.

Analysts divided over impact of GST overhaul,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/analysts-divided-over-impact-of-gst-overhaul/articleshow/123397722.cms,"Representational Image

Mixed signals

MUMBAI: The government's planned GST overhaul has drawn mixed assessments from HSBC, S&P and SBI, with estimates of a potential revenue gap ranging from Rs 60,000 crore to Rs 1.43 lakh crore, though the actual fiscal impact remains uncertain.HSBC warned of a $16 bn (Rs 1.43 lakh crore, or 0.4% of GDP) shortfall if products are shifted into lower tax slabs, while SBI projected a smaller average loss of Rs 85,000 crore, with Rs 45,000 crore in FY26, that could be largely offset through the compensation cess. S&P, meanwhile, noted it was too early to gauge the precise impact, adding that reforms were unlikely to be pushed to the extent of significantly weakening government revenues.HSBC's analysis suggested the revenue burden would be equally split between the Centre and states, but pointed out that states may find it harder to manage under FRBM deficit caps without cutting capital expenditure. If the Centre were to compensate them, it would need fresh resources, though raising taxes on luxury goods would dilute the intent of simplifying slabs. Still, HSBC highlighted two benefits from the move - a near-term demand boost and long-term efficiency gains from a simpler, more predictable system.SBI's assessment was more sanguine, arguing that the immediate revenue loss can be absorbed using the cess buffer.Even if it isn't, it estimated that a consumption boost of Rs 5.5 lakh crore could generate around Rs 52,000 crore in additional GST collections. The proposed reform would collapse the four current GST slabs - 5%, 12%, 18% and 28% - into two (5% and 18%), with a 40% rate for luxury and sin goods.","HSBC warned of a $16 bn shortfall if products are shifted into lower tax slabs.

What's so rare about rare earth magnets,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/whats-so-rare-about-rare-earth-magnets/articleshow/123397640.cms,"What’s so rare about rare earth magnets

What's the meaning of rare earth magnets?

What's the China angle to rare earth magnets?

Mining of rare earth ores

Separation and refining of rare earth elements (a complex and environmentally sensitive process)

Alloy production and magnet manufacturing

Auto industry has been hit the most by curbs imposed by China

India's plans to achieve self-sustainability

Long-term plan

NEW DELHI: China has decided to lift the curbs on export of rare earth magnets to India, in a relief to industries, such as automobiles (especially electric vehicles manufacturing), renewable energy (wind turbines), consumer electronics, defence and aerospace, and healthcare.Rare earth magnets are the strongest type of permanent magnets commercially available. Their high magnetic strength and resistance to demagnetisation make them indispensable in a range of applications, especially where weight and space are constraints. According to experts, these magnets are made primarily from rare earth elements like neodymium, praseodymium, and dysprosium - materials that allow for powerful magnetic properties essential in miniaturised and energy-efficient devices. They are typically made from alloys that contain rare earth elements.The most commonly used rare earth magnet is the neodymium-iron-boron (NdFeB) magnet.China is estimated to account for about 70% of global rare earth metals mining and holds nearly 90% of the world's rare earth magnet production. Widespread usage of these rare earth magnets has started over the past six-to-eight years, owing to factors, such as their compact size, weight, high effectiveness and high thermal resistance in comparison to normal ferrite/traditional magnets.One of the biggest reasons that China dominates the global rare earth magnet industry is its control over the entire supply chain, including:In the Indian auto industry, about 870 tonnes of rare-earth magnets are required to be imported in 2025-26 out of the country's estimated overall requirement of 3,600 tonnes.Component suppliers in India have been importing these magnets as raw materials to manufacture components/sub- assemblies domestically for automotive applications. Such rare earth magnets are used across applications both for Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) vehicles and Electric Vehicles (EVs) for components like speedometer, electric motors, e-axle, electric water pump, automatic transmission kits, speakers, sensors and ignition coils in engines. As China placed restrictions and mandated a highly structured process for importing them (which no company could clear), most of the companies raised the red flag - saying that production will need to be stopped and launches will be delayed. The relaxation by China will bring massive relief to the industry, especially with high-demand festive season around.Till the time local mining, ore and magnets production arrangements are done, companies are requesting govt to facilitate import from non-China-based sources, such as from Vietnam, Brazil, and Russia.To become self-reliant in the production of rare earth magnets over a three-to-five year period, India needs to establish a complete domestic value chain. Financial incentives, linked to production and policy support, are required to encourage companies to invest in high-technology areas. Govt needs to encourage local mining and production of magnets for reducing dependence on China through incentives. Financial and policy support may be provided to encourage public-private partnerships in setting up rare earth processing facilities and magnet production clusters across the country.",China has decided to lift the curbs on export of rare earth magnets to India.

Gaming In Numbers

NEW DELHI: The Indian gaming industry, which till just a few years back was seen as a sunrise sector, was shell-shocked by govt's proposed move to ban ""online money game"", claiming it would sound the death knell for firms.Industry experts pointed out that the measure would put 4 lakh companies, 2 lakh jobs, investments of Rs 25,000 crore and annual GST of Rs 20,000 crore at risk. As draft copies of the Bill started circulating online, gaming executives said they would ""need to wind down operations with no plausible source of revenue in sight"" in case the law is enacted. ""We will fold up if this becomes a reality,"" a top official said.“We will fold up if this becomes a reality,” a top official at one of the biggest gaming companies in India said. “What is surprising is that, while govt regularly consulted us on most of the issues, there was virtually no discussion this time around on a proposal that has the capacity to decimate us,” the official — whose company is big in fantasy gaming, where again real-money transactions are popular — told TOI.There will be a downstream impact to domestic sports as fantasy sponsorship keeps most non-top T20 leagues afloat, with state and city leagues likely to be hit, weakening the talent pipeline, industry players said.Most companies insisted that large Indian gaming players, with regulatory structures and strong funding, including FDI, were “not engaging in any illegal activities” such as betting, money laundering, terror financing or gambling. Dream11 , Games 24x7, MPL, Gameskraft, Nazara Technologies, Zupee and WinZO are among the big players in this space.“Our operations were broadly focused on skill-based real-money games. These have been the source of most of our revenues, which has seen us build valuations, provide jobs to engineers and graphic designers, gain global recognition and FDI funding and provide GST and tax to govt,” another founder of a top company said.Industry sources said there is also a risk of some the platforms moving offshore or other apps taking advantage of the gap, with weak KYC and anti-money laundering provisions and in turn, impacting tax collections.Countries such as the UK, the US and Australia regulate and licence the business with strict KYC, and advertising rules and enforcement, instead of a ban, and industry players suggested that even in India this should be the preferred model to regulate and monetise the industry. The 2023 framework, which is sought to be junked, had created rules and a self-regulatory organisation path for “permissible” real-money games, which should be strengthened, they suggested.Besides, the bill leaves several gaps as there is no transition plan. If a law is legislated, there is a need for wind-down, ensuring user balance refunds and employee protections to avoid a cliff-edge shock, said experts.A balanced outcome can be achieved by licensing onshore operators, setting deposit and loss limits, along with affordability checks, localising data, and blocking illegal offshore sites aggressively, they added.","Indian gaming industry was shell-shocked by govt's proposed move to ban ""online money game"" Industry experts pointed out that the measure would put 4 lakh companies, 2 lakh jobs, investments of Rs 25,000 crore and annual GST of Rs 20,000 crores at risk.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123396285,imgsize-16806,width-400,resizemode-4/123396285.jpg"

In which direction is Hurricane Erin headed?







Hurricane Erin strengthened into a category 5 hurricane, the US National Hurricane Center (NHC) said on Saturday.Erin is about 160 miles (255 kilometers) north of Anguilla, as the NHC warned of possible flooding and landslides.Tropical storm watches have been issued for Anguilla, Barbuda, St. Martin, St. Barts, Saba, St. Eustatius and St. Maarten while heavy rains are expected in Antigua and Barbuda, the US and British Virgin Islands and southern and eastern Puerto Rico. Up to 4 inches (10 centimeters) of rain is anticipated, with isolated totals of up to 6 inches (15 centimeters), according to the NHC.The NHC said Eric could create powerful rip currents off parts of the US East Coast later in the week, even if its eye forecast remains far offshore.Hurricane expert Michael Lowry said Erin is forecast to eventually take a sharp turn northeast that would put it on a route between the US and Bermuda.""All of our best consensus aids show Erin turning safely east of the United States next week, but it'll be a much closer call for Bermuda, which could land on the stronger eastern side of Erin,"" he said.Erin is the Atlantic season's first hurricane and is expected to become a major Category 3 storm late this weekend, passing around 200 miles north of Puerto Rico.","Erin is about 160 miles (255 kilometers) north of Anguilla, as the NHC warned of possible flooding and landslides.

Powell’s term ends in May 2026, AP reported.Speaking to CNBC, Bessent said, “I’m going to be meeting with them, probably right before, right after Labor Day, and to start bringing down the list to present to President Trump.” He described the pool as “an incredible group” of candidates from within the Fed, former Fed members, and private sector professionals.While he did not specify the names, media reports have listed Fed governors Michelle Bowman and Christopher Waller, former Fed governor Kevin Warsh, and National Economic Council director Kevin Hassett as being in the running.

Air Canada said Tuesday it will gradually restart operations after reaching an agreement with the union representing 10,000 flight attendants to end a strike that had disrupted travel for about 130,000 passengers daily at the peak of the summer season.The deal was announced by the Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE) early Tuesday after both sides returned to the negotiating table late Monday for the first time since the walkout began over the weekend, AP reported.The union said the agreement guarantees pay for work performed while planes are on the ground, one of the key issues behind the strike. “Unpaid work is over. We have reclaimed our voice and our power,"" it said in a statement. “When our rights were taken away, we stood strong, we fought back — and we secured a tentative agreement that our members can vote on.”Air Canada chief executive Michael Rousseau called restarting operations a complex process and said it could take seven to ten days for full service to resume. “Full restoration may require a week or more, so we ask for our customers' patience and understanding over the coming days,” Rousseau said in a statement.The airline confirmed that flights would begin resuming Tuesday evening but warned some cancellations would continue until schedules stabilise. Mediation talks, it said, were based on the union’s commitment that flight attendants would immediately return to work.The deal came hours after the union had defied back-to-work directives, calling them unconstitutional. The Canada Industrial Relations Board had declared the strike illegal on Monday and ordered attendants to return to duty, but the union resisted. Leaders had also ignored an earlier weekend order to enter binding arbitration.The board, an independent tribunal, was directed by the government to intervene. Labour leaders have criticised Ottawa for repeatedly using laws to curb the right to strike, pointing out that similar measures had been imposed on port and railway workers in recent years. “Your right to vote on your wages was preserved,” the union said in an online post.Air Canada, which runs around 700 flights daily, had estimated that nearly 500,000 passengers were affected by cancellations since last Thursday. Aviation analytics firm Cirium said that by Monday afternoon the carrier had cancelled at least 1,219 domestic and 1,339 international flights.Toronto’s Pearson International Airport, the country’s largest, said it would deploy extra staff to assist travellers as operations resume.

AU$90 million penalty: Qantas Airways fined for illegal sackings during Covid pandemic; judge questions lack of remorse,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/au90-million-penalty-qantas-airways-fined-for-illegal-sackings-during-covid-pandemic-judge-slams-lack-of-remorse/articleshow/123360283.cms,"Representative image

A judge in Australia fined Qantas Airways 90 million Australian dollars ($59 million) for unlawfully dismissing more than 1,800 ground staff during the early stages of the Covid-19 pandemic. The penalty is in addition to the AU$120 million ($78 million) compensation the airline had already agreed to pay dismissed employees.Justice Michael Lee of the Australian Federal Court ruled that the dismissal of 1,820 baggage handlers and cleaners at airports in late 2020 was the most serious breach of Australian labour laws in their 120-year history, according to the Associated Press.After Qantas’s appeal was unanimously rejected by seven High Court judges last December, the airline confirmed its wrongdoing and agreed to pay AU$120 million in compensation. The Transport Workers Union (TWU), which initiated the case, had sought the maximum penalty of AU$121 million.Justice Lee determined that AU$90 million was the minimum deterrent, noting Qantas executives had expected annual savings of AU$125 million through outsourcing. He also questioned the airline’s remorse, highlighting its subsequent unsuccessful attempt to avoid paying compensation.""If any further evidence was needed of the unrelenting and aggressive litigation strategy adopted in this case by Qantas, it is provided by this effort directed to denying any compensation whatsoever to those in respect of whom Qantas was publicly professing regret for their misfortune,"" Lee said.""I do think that the people in charge of Qantas now have some genuine regret, but this more likely reflects the damage that this case has done to the company rather than remorse for the damage done to the affected workers,"" he added.Following the ruling, Qantas CEO Vanessa Hudson, who was CFO at the time of the redundancies, issued an apology: ""We sincerely apologize to each and every one of the 1,820 ground handling employees and to their families who suffered as a result. The decision to outsource five years ago, particularly during such an uncertain time, caused genuine hardship for many of our former team and their families.

Rubio sets the record straight on where Trump stands with Putin's demands

US State Secretary Marco Rubio cautioned on Monday about potential energy price increases if the United States enforces secondary sanctions on China for processing Russian oil.The US secretary was asked, ""is Europe still buying Russian oil?""""Well, if you look at the oil that’s going to China and being refined, a lot of that is then being sold back into Europe. Europe’s also buying natural gas still. Now, there are countries trying to wean themselves off it, but there’s more Europe can do with regard to their own sanctions,"" Rubio responded during an interview with Fox Business on Sunday.The statement comes amid objections over the US's selective approach- imposing a 25% additional tariff on India (taking total to 50%) for Russian oil purchases while taking no comparable measures against China.Rubio was further asked about sanctions on Europe for continuing to purchase Russia oil. ""Wouldn't that be a major lever to pull to put sanctions on Europe or or punish Europe for continuing to buy oil and gas from Russia? Is that something on the table?"" asked Fox News' 'Sunday Morning Futures' anchor Maria Bartiromo.In response Rubio added, ""Well, I don't know about on Europe directly obviously, but certainly there are implications to secondary sanctions.If you put secondary sanctions on a country – let's say you were to go after the oil sales of Russian oil to China. Well, China just refines that oil. That oil is then sold into the global marketplace, and anyone who's buying that oil would be paying more for it or, if it doesn't exist, would have to find an alternative source for it,"" Rubio said further during the interview.""So we have heard, when you talk about the Senate bill that was being proposed where there was a hundred percent tariffs on China and India, we did hear from a number of European countries – not in press releases but we heard from them – some concern about what that could mean. But look, I don't want to get into a tit for tat with Europeans on this."" he further added.Currently, China leads Russian oil purchases at approximately 2 million barrels daily, with India and Turkey following.The sanctions discussion has resurfaced following Trump's notable meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska on August 15. Despite the summit failing to achieve a Ukraine ceasefire agreement, Trump described the talks as productive, giving them a ""10 out of 10.""Previously, the US president had suggested that India-targeted tariffs for Russian oil purchases influenced Moscow's decision to seek dialogue with Washington, citing Russia's loss of its ""second largest customer"".In his Fox News interview on Thursday, Trump had said, ""I think everything has an impact,"" adding that when he informed India ""we're going to charge you, because you're dealing with Russia and oil purchases"", it ""essentially took them out of buying oil from Russia"".However, India recently confirmed its continuation of Russian oil purchases despite US presidential tariff threats, maintaining its focus on economic factors.",US State Secretary Marco Rubio cautioned on Monday about potential energy price increases if the United States enforces secondary sanctions on China for processing Russian oil.

Contract talks break down

Travellers left in limbo

Air Canada has suspended all operations after more than 10,000 of its flight attendants walked off the job early Saturday, plunging peak summer travel into chaos and leaving passengers stranded around the world.The strike began shortly before 1 am EDT after a deadline to reach a new contract passed, Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE) spokesman Hugh Pouliot confirmed, as per news agency AP.The airline announced soon after that it would halt flights entirely, strongly advising customers “not to go to the airport” and expressing “deep regret” over the disruption, reported news agency AFP.The complete shutdown is affecting Air Canada’s full schedule of about 700 daily flights, impacting roughly 130,000 travellers per day, including an estimated 25,000 Canadians abroad.By Friday night, the airline had already cancelled 623 flights affecting more than 100,000 passengers, according to AFP.Negotiations between Air Canada and CUPE have been ongoing for about eight months but remain deadlocked over pay and compensation for unpaid ground duties. The union has refused to enter government-directed arbitration, which would have removed its right to strike, saying it wants to bargain directly.“We’re here to bargain a deal, not to go on strike,” Pouliot said in an email cited by AP, adding that Air Canada had not countered the union’s last two proposals since Tuesday.Air Canada’s latest offer included a 38% increase in total compensation over four years, which it said would make its flight attendants the best paid in Canada.A Thursday statement from the airline detailed that, under the proposal, a senior flight attendant would earn about C$87,000 by 2027.The union has rejected the offer, calling it “below inflation and below market value”. CUPE is also seeking pay for ground duties such as boarding, which are currently uncompensated, a standard practice in the airline industry but one the union says is unfair.Rafael Gomez, director of the University of Toronto’s Centre for Industrial Relations, was quoted by AFP as saying that while unpaid pre-flight work is common globally, CUPE has successfully framed it as an issue of fairness in the public eye. “That’s a very good issue to highlight,” he said, noting that any gains here could influence other carriers.With planes grounded, travellers have been left scrambling. Montreal resident Alex Laroche, 21, said he and his girlfriend had saved since Christmas for an $8,000 European vacation — now at risk. “At this point, it’s just a waiting game,” Laroche said, as per AP.He initially resented the strike but changed his mind after learning about the wage dispute, saying, “Their wage is barely livable.”Air Canada says passengers can request full refunds via its website or app, and it will attempt to rebook travellers on other carriers where possible. However, the airline warns that alternative flights are already full due to summer demand.Canada’s federal jobs minister Patty Hajdu urged both sides to “work harder” to resolve the dispute, calling it “unacceptable that such little progress has been made”. The Business Council of Canada warned before the strike that halting Air Canada’s passenger and cargo services could cause “immediate and extensive harm” to the economy.Industry experts expect the stoppage to be short-lived. “This is peak season,” Gomez said. “The airline does not want to lose hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue… They’re almost playing chicken with the flight attendants”.","Air Canada has suspended all operations after more than 10,000 flight attendants walked off the job early Saturday.

Affordability vs returns

When Oakland resident Terrence Dwyer got a flyer advertising a solar system small enough to fit on his deck — and that plugs into a regular wall socket — he didn’t hesitate. “Absolutely, let’s do this right away,” he said.Such “plug-in” or “balcony” solar kits, long popular in Europe for their affordability and easy installation, are now gaining traction in the US, AP reported. The momentum is expected to build as President Donald Trump’s budget package ends residential rooftop solar tax credits, potentially shifting interest to cheaper, smaller alternatives.Dwyer’s $2,000 setup — two 400-watt panels, an inverter, smart meter and circuit breaker — saves him about $35 a month on power bills. “We like the environmental benefits of solar and wanted to engage with solar in some fashion,” he said. A comparable rooftop system would have cost him $20,000 plus $30,000 in roof upgrades.US adoption has been slower than Europe’s due to patchy utility rules, low awareness and limited availability. Some utilities require the same interconnection paperwork as rooftop systems, despite plug-in models being designed to prevent power flowing back into the grid.In March, Utah became the first state to pass a law exempting small plug-in systems from interconnection agreements while mandating safety certification. Republican state Rep. Raymond Ward, who sponsored the bill, said: “Europe has these things. You can go buy them and they work… there is no reason why we shouldn’t have them here.”California-based nonprofit Bright Saver, which sold Dwyer his kit, also offers a $399 model that sold out in six days. “The interest and demand have been overwhelming,” said co-founder Cora Stryker. Bright Saver and others are lobbying more states for supportive legislation.Experts say savings vary widely. UC Berkeley’s Severin Borenstein estimates a $2,000 US kit costs roughly $0.20/kWh over 25 years — viable mainly in areas with high utility rates. In Europe, where kits cost around $600, the equivalent rate is $0.05–$0.06/kWh.Baltimore engineer Craig Keenan installed a $399 Bright Saver kit on his balcony in July. “I’m interested in renewable energy because the amount of carbon emissions we produce is unsustainable,” he said. It will save him about $40 annually and took just 15 minutes to set up.Texas-based Craftstrom has sold about 2,000 kits since 2021, mostly in California, Texas and Florida. China’s EcoFlow plans to enter Utah before expanding to other states. “This is an example of technology being ahead of regulators,” said EcoFlow’s Ryan Oliver.Analysts expect demand to accelerate as rooftop solar credits expire. “Utilities prefer everyone being a predictable and generous consumer,” said UCLA’s Robert Cudd. “Plug-in solar changes that.”","'plug-in' or 'balcony' solar kits are now gaining traction in the US. momentum is expected to build as President Donald Trump’s budget package ends residential rooftop solar tax credits.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 141 points, or 0.3%, while the Nasdaq composite slipped 0.1%, according to AP.Investor optimism has grown on expectations of a September rate cut, which could boost asset prices and spur economic activity by lowering borrowing costs for US households and businesses. However, lower rates also risk fuelling inflation. A weaker-than-expected US wholesale inflation report on Thursday trimmed some of the rate-cut optimism, but traders still largely expect the Fed to act. Treasury yields have retreated sharply in recent days and were steady on Friday.Economic data released Friday painted a mixed picture: US retail sales rose as forecast in July, manufacturing in New York state unexpectedly expanded, but nationwide industrial production fell, missing expectations for modest growth.Later in the day, a consumer sentiment report on inflation and the economy was awaited.On Wall Street, UnitedHealth Group soared 10.3% after Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway disclosed the purchase of nearly 5 million shares in the insurer during the spring, valued at $1.57 billion. Berkshire Hathaway shares gained 0.2%.Applied Materials fell 12.5% despite posting quarterly results above analyst forecasts, as its revenue guidance for the current quarter disappointed investors. CEO Gary Dickerson cited a “dynamic macroeconomic and policy environment” creating uncertainty, particularly for the company’s China business. Sandisk dropped 4.9% after its upbeat quarterly profit was overshadowed by a weaker-than-expected profit outlook.In Asia, Japan’s Nikkei 225 rose 1.7% on stronger-than-expected GDP growth, while Shanghai gained 0.8% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng shed 1% after data showed China’s economy slowed across key indicators in July, prompting calls for more policy support.ING Economics noted, “Chinese economic activity slowed across the board in July, with retail sales, fixed asset investment, and value added of industry growth all reaching the lowest levels of the year.

Shoppers in the US kept up a healthy pace of spending in July, particularly at auto dealerships, even as President Donald Trump's tariffs began taking a toll on jobs and pushed some prices higher.Retail sales rose 0.5% last month, slowing from a revised 0.9% in June, according to the Commerce Department’s report released Friday. The July pace matched economists’ estimates. June’s figure had been revised upward, AP reported.The gains came after two straight months of declines — a 0.1% dip in April and a 0.9% fall in May. Excluding auto sales, which have been volatile since Trump imposed tariffs on many foreign-made cars, sales rose 0.3%. Auto sales jumped 1.6%, returning to more normal spending levels after a March-April surge, when buyers rushed to beat Trump’s 25% duty on imported cars and parts, followed by a slump. Samuel Tombs, chief US economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the pattern reflected that early rush and subsequent slowdown.The report showed broad-based spending gains. Clothing store sales climbed 0.7%, online retailers gained 0.8%, and home furnishings and furniture stores rose 1.4%.Electronics store sales fell 0.6%, while restaurants — the lone services component in the Census Bureau report and a key discretionary spending gauge — slipped 0.4% as more shoppers opted to eat at home to cut costs.Spending resilience comes even as Trump’s tariffs slow hiring and raise prices. Earlier this month, the Labor Department reported US employers added just 73,000 jobs in July, far below the 115,000 expected, as trade policies rattled businesses and dented economic outlook.A separate government report Tuesday showed inflation was unchanged in July, with rising prices for some imports offset by cheaper gas and groceries. Consumer prices rose 2.7% from a year earlier, matching June’s pace and up from a post-pandemic low of 2.3% in April. Core prices, excluding food and energy, rose 3.1%, up from 2.9% in June — both above the Federal Reserve’s 2% target.On a monthly basis, prices rose 0.2% in July, down from 0.3% in June, while core prices ticked up 0.3% from 0.2%. Slower rent increases and lower fuel prices appear to be offsetting some tariff effects. Many companies are still absorbing much of the added costs from Trump’s 10% universal tariff imposed in April and higher duties on countries including China and Canada.That could soon change. The Labor Department said Thursday its producer price index — measuring inflation before it reaches consumers — jumped 0.9% from June, the biggest monthly gain in over three years. Wholesale prices were up 3.3% from a year earlier, both figures exceeding forecasts.The data come as major retailers such as Walmart and Target prepare to release fiscal second-quarter earnings next week. Analysts will look for signs of how much of the tariff costs are being passed on to consumers and assess consumer sentiment ahead of the fall and winter shopping seasons.In May, Walmart warned that banana prices from Costa Rica had risen from 50 cents to 54 cents a pound and that more significant price impacts would emerge in June and July. Chief financial officer John David Rainey told The Associated Press he expected car seats from China priced at $350 could cost customers an extra $100.Several other companies, including Procter & Gamble, e.l.f. Cosmetics, Black & Decker, and Ralph Lauren, have told investors they have raised or plan to raise prices. Eyewear retailer Warby Parker is taking a selective approach, lifting prices only on premium products to offset tariff costs.Warby Parker has been reducing its reliance on China, targeting a year-end goal of keeping the share of goods sourced there under 15%. Still, the company faces higher tariffs from other countries.Executives said they plan to keep the $95 option but will increase prices for certain lens types, focusing more on older customers who need progressive lenses. Progressives, trifocals, and bifocals account for about 40% of prescription sales industrywide, but only 23% of Warby Parker’s business. These lenses are the company’s most expensive offerings and carry the highest margins.“We were able to quickly roll out select strategic price increases that have benefited our growth,” said Neil Blumenthal, co-chairman, co-founder, and co-CEO of Warby Parker.","Retail sales rose 0.5% last month, slowing from a revised 0.9% in June.

Asian stock markets showed a mixed performance on Friday, with strong Japanese growth figures offset by weaker Chinese data, while oil prices slipped ahead of a high-stakes US-Russia summit on Ukraine.As per news agency AFP, Japan’s economy expanded by 0.3% in the April-June quarter, surpassing forecasts, while the previous quarter’s output was revised upwards, helping the world’s fourth-largest economy avoid a technical recession.The growth came despite tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump on Japanese imports, including cars, an industry that provides around 8% of Japan’s jobs. The Nikkei 225 rose nearly 1% in morning trade, while markets in Shanghai, Seoul, and Sydney also edged higher.However, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index dropped for a second straight session after China’s July retail sales and industrial production grew at a slower pace than expected.Reuters noted that the CSI 300 index erased early gains, reflecting ongoing concerns about China’s prolonged real estate slump, high youth unemployment, and weak consumer sentiment, pressures worsened by the US-China trade war.On Wall Street, stocks ended largely flat on Thursday after strong US producer price inflation dampened hopes of a larger interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve next month.“What it did was to get rid of all the chat about a 50 basis point cut,” said Mike Houlahan of Electus Financial, as quoted by Reuters.Markets are now pricing in a 92% chance of a quarter-point cut, with no expectations of a half-point move.Oil prices eased in Asian trade, reversing Thursday’s gains. According to AFP, traders are cautious ahead of Friday’s Alaska summit between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Stephen Schork of the Schork Group warned that a failed meeting could lead to “stronger sanctions on Russian oil, making it much more difficult for this oil to get to the market.”Key regional indices at 0230 GMT showed Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 up 0.9% at 43,036.46, Shanghai Composite up 0.3% at 3,675.05, Hang Seng down 1.1% at 25,236.62, and Brent crude slipping 0.1% to $66.76 per barrel.","Japan's economy expanded by 0.3% in the April-June quarter, surpassing forecasts.

Japan recorded modest economic growth in the April–June quarter, overcoming the pressure of steep US tariffs, official figures showed on Friday.Preliminary data from the Cabinet Office indicated that gross domestic product (GDP) grew 0.3% from the previous quarter, outpacing market expectations of 0.1%. The January–March reading was also revised up to 0.1% growth from a previous estimate of contraction, avoiding what could have been a technical recession.On an annualised basis, the economy expanded 1%, higher than forecasts of 0.4% and following 0.6% growth in the prior quarter, reported news agency AFP.Economists polled by Reuters had anticipated a weaker performance, but robust exports, which contributed 0.3 percentage points to GDP after a sharp drop in Q1, helped support the uptick, according to CNBC. Japan’s trade deficit also narrowed in the second quarter.The improvement offers some relief to Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, whose political future has been under strain after his coalition lost its majority in the upper house in July.“This is a welcome sign, but the economy still faces many downside risks,” said Yoshiki Shinke of Dai-ichi Life Research Institute, as quoted by AFP, cautioning that export volumes could come under pressure if automakers adjust pricing to offset tariffs.Japan’s auto sector, a key employer and export driver, has been hit by US duties of up to 27.5%. A recent trade agreement reduced the rate on cars to 15%, but the change has not yet taken effect. Toyota has warned of a $9.5 billion tariff impact this year, while Honda and Sony have scaled back their earlier loss projections.The Bank of Japan recently upgraded its 2025 fiscal growth forecast to 0.6% but warned that global trade tensions and weakening overseas economies could weigh on corporate profits.Analysts, including Marcel Thieliant of Capital Economics, expect growth to slow in the coming quarters, with inflation pressures likely prompting the BoJ to resume tightening in October.","Japan recorded modest economic growth in the April–June quarter.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.","Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain.

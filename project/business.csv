What should you do with defence stocks?

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market and other asset classes given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)

Defence stocks in India rallied between 5% to 11.5% on April 28, due to growing India-Pakistan tensions and the anticipated announcement of the Rafale-M fighter aircraft agreement.Several defence-related companies, including Paras Defence , Garden Reach Shipbuilders, Data Patterns, Cochin Shipyard, Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders, and Hindustan Aeronautics , registered substantial gains. The increase coincides with ongoing tensions at the Line of Control (LoC) after the Pahalgam terror incident, with multiple ceasefire breaches reported during the weekend.India has implemented various countermeasures, including the suspension of the Indus Water Treaty, cessation of Wagah Border activities, and instructions for Pakistani citizens to depart.Defence stocks have gained additional attention as India and France prepare to officially confirm the Rs 63,000 crore agreement for 26 Rafale-M fighter jets . Initial deliveries are anticipated in roughly three-and-a-half years, with the entire contract completion planned within six-and-a-half years.Paras Defence led the Nifty India Defence index with an 11.5% increase. Data Patterns, Cochin Shipyard, and Bharat Dynamics showed gains of 9.6%, 7%, and 6% respectively. Hindustan Aeronautics increased by 5%. The Nifty India Defence index demonstrated an overall increase exceeding 4%.Experts indicate that firms demonstrating sound financial health, effective implementation capabilities and compatibility with India's defence priorities are positioned for success, according to an ET report.""We believe that a government effort to indigenous defence manufacturing is likely to bear fruits for the domestic companies over medium to long term,"" said Atish Matlawala, Sr Fundamental Analyst at SSJ Finance & Securities.""We like BEL, Mazagon dock and shipbuilders and Bharat Dynamics Ltd as these companies have strong orderbook, reasonable valuations and more importantly does not depend on foreign collaboration for technology transfer as in the case of HAL,"" he said.Experts indicate that Pakistan-related tensions are short-lived without substantial changes warranting immediate investment. Existing investors may retain holdings, whilst prospective investors should await better entry opportunities or clearer developments say experts, according to the ET report.For long-term investments, Matlawala recommends BEL, Mazagon Dock and Shipbuilders, and Bharat Dynamics, citing their robust order books, fair valuations and independence from foreign technology transfers, unlike HAL.BEL maintains leadership in defence electronics and radar systems, benefitting from increased investments in surveillance, communication and electronic warfare systems. The company currently shows a P/E ratio of 43x with EV/EBITDA of 30x.Paras Defence contributes significantly to force multiplication and threat reduction in counter-terrorism and cross-border operations through enhanced situational awareness and intelligence capabilities. The company presently trades at P/E of 84x with EV/EBITDA of 48x.Atul Parakh, CEO of Bigul offers an alternative perspective: ""Current valuations appear more reasonable after the correction, with the sector trading at a slight discount to its recent premium levels.""","Defence stocks in India rallied between 5% to 11.5% on April 28, due to growing India-Pakistan tensions and the anticipated announcement of the Rafale-M fighter aircraft agreement.

Indus Waters Treaty suspended: Modi government looks to expedite five major J&K hydroelectric power projects,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/infrastructure/with-indus-waters-treaty-suspended-modi-government-looks-to-expedite-five-major-jk-hydroelectric-power-projects/articleshow/120687824.cms,"Modi government is considering moving forward with several hydroelectric initiatives.

India is looking to expedite five significant hydroelectric power projects in Jammu & Kashmir , following its decision to keep the Indus Waters Treaty suspended. These projects can progress more rapidly without the previously required Indus Waters Treaty approval process.Sources told ET that the government is considering moving forward with several hydroelectric initiatives: the 800 MW Bursar plant, 260 MW Dulhasti II, 1856 MW Swalkote HEP, 240 MW Uri Stage II, and 930 MW Kirthai II.The Narendra Modi government’s initiative to accelerate these projects serves two primary objectives: addressing J&K's power needs whilst strengthening India's position regarding western river water resources, currently limited by the Indus Waters Treaty. Collectively, these developments could generate 4000MW for power-deficient J&K. While Uri Stage II is situated on the Jhelum River in Baramulla district, the remaining projects are planned within the Chenab valley.The projects are likely to be completed in 3-5 years after they were prioritised following recent high-level discussions after the Pahalgam terror attack . They are integral to India's strategy regarding Indus Waters Treaty suspension.Apart from Uri-II, which recently received Indus Waters Treaty approval, the other projects await clearance under the Indus Waters Treaty framework.The largest among these initiatives is Swalkote, situated in Ramban district, featuring a 192.5-metre dam, whilst Dulhasti Stage-II will be established in Kishtwar district with an underground powerhouse (2x130 MW).The Bursar hydroelectric project , planned in Kishtwar district, serves as a storage facility that will regulate water flow, benefiting all downstream projects during periods of reduced flow.Present IWT regulations permit India to construct hydroelectric projects on the western river systems of Jhelum, Chenab and Indus exclusively through run-of-the-river systems.These projects must comply with specific design and operational requirements as stipulated by the IWT. The treaty additionally grants Pakistan the authority to contest design elements of Indian hydroelectric projects, as seen in 2021 with the 1000MW Pakal Dul in Kishtwar, Lower Kalnai project in Doda district, and the Durbuk Shyok and Nimu Chilling projects.Following the suspension of Article 370, Pakistan requested details about various projects in J&K and Ladakh, causing delays. Pakistan's objections regarding Kishanganga and Ratle projects have necessitated 'neutral expert' intervention for dispute resolution, significantly impeding progress-a major concern for India.Uri-II experienced delays since 2010 due to Pakistan's design-related objections. With India's decision to suspend the Indus Waters Treaty, it aims to bypass this consultation process entirely. This approach could particularly benefit projects that have secured necessary domestic approvals, including technical and environmental clearances, and are solely awaiting IWT authorisation, which applies to most of the five identified projects.Various governmental bodies have begun consultations on this subject, including deliberations between the Central Water Commission, Central Electricity Authority, NHPC and the J&K Power Development Corporation.",India is looking to expedite five significant hydroelectric power projects in Jammu & Kashmir.

IndusInd Bank's deputy CEO quits over accounting lapses,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/indusind-banks-deputy-ceo-quits-over-accounting-lapses/articleshow/120713184.cms,"IndusInd Bank

Mumbai: IndusInd Bank 's deputy CEO Arun Khurana has resigned with immediate effect, taking responsibility for a nearly Rs 2,000-crore impact due to derivative trade accounting lapses . The bank disclosed Khurana's resignation, who was executive director and deputy CEO, in a filing on Monday.Last month, RBI approved a one-year extension for the bank's MD and CEO, Sumant Kathpalia, as opposed to the three years approved by the board.Khurana's resignation comes a day after the bank informed the stock exchanges that it would hold staff accountable for the hit of close to Rs 2,000 crore that the bank will take. An independent investigation, commissioned in March 2025, confirmed an adverse accounting impact of Rs 1,960 crore as of March 31. The report was submitted on Saturday and taken up by the board, which met for the purpose on April 26-27.In his resignation letter, Khurana cited the recent discovery of an adverse accounting impact on the bank's profit & loss statement, resulting from incorrect accounting for internal derivative trades, as the reason for his decision. ""I, having oversight of the treasury front office function, as the whole-time director, deputy CEO, and a part of the senior management of the bank, hereby resign, effective immediately.I would like to offer my assistance, as deemed appropriate, in transitioning my responsibilities to ensure a smooth handover,"" he said in his resignation letter.The discrepancies stemmed from internal derivative trades between the asset-liability management desk and the treasury, which used accrual accounting, while external counterparties' trades were marked to market. This mismatch allowed IndusInd Bank to defer losses internally while prematurely booking gains externally, overstating earnings.","IndusInd Bank's deputy CEO Arun Khurana has resigned with immediate effect.

Had you listened to your grandmother and bought gold on Akshaya Tritiya , your investment would have earned handsome returns. Rising geopolitical tensions and widespread economic uncertainty have pushed gold prices to almost Rs 10,000 per gram. Gold bought on this auspicious day has delivered double-digit returns in the past 25 years.A substantial portion of these returns is attributable to the dramatic rise in gold prices in the past four years. Gold prices have more than doubled from Rs 47,452 per 10 grams in April 2021 to Rs 98,955 now. Investments in the yellow metal since 2021 have yielded more than 20 per cent returns. That’s more than what equity funds have delivered in the past four years.However, though gold prices have moved up smartly, the yellow metal has also witnessed extended periods of muted returns. Between 2014 and 2018, the annualised return from gold was less than 2 per cent. Gold could not even beat the 4.8 per cent annual consumer inflation during that period.Many financial advisors consider gold a dead investment that doesn’t generate any income or pay dividends. While that is true to some extent, gold is an excellent diversification tool because its price is not linked with other asset classes.During a geopolitical crisis or periods of high inflation, equities tend to do poorly. But these conditions are good for gold. The negative correlation reduces the portfolio risk. Gold is also a very liquid asset and can be bought and sold across global markets.Experts forecast a further upside in 2025. Geopolitical tensions have only increased, and the new occupant in the White House has triggered a worldwide tariff war.Even so, don’t look at gold as a speculative bet. Rather, treat it as a wealth preservation tool and portfolio diversifier. Experts advise that investors should not put more than 15-20 per cent of their overall portfolio in the yellow metal.With gold hitting Rs 1 lakh per 10 grams, many investors may be thinking of booking profits. With the removal of the indexation benefit in 2023, gains from gold are now added to the income of the investor and taxed at normal rates.But Sovereign Gold Bonds (SGBs) offer a unique tax advantage to investors. SGBs are issued by the RBI, and their prices are linked to the price of gold. Investors get 2.5 per cent interest every year, which is fully taxable. But if SGBs are held till maturity, the capital gains from the investment are tax-free.","Gold bought on this auspicious day has delivered double-digit returns in the past 25 years.

Sebi bans broker over Rs 3cr 'spoofing' gains,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sebi-bans-broker-over-rs-3cr-spoofing-gains/articleshow/120713134.cms,"Sebi

MUMBAI: Markets regulator Sebi has detected a unique case of stock price manipulation where a broker, Patel Wealth Advisors , and its four directors used the ' spoofing ' technique to make illegal gains worth Rs 3.2 crore over more than three years. Sebi ordered disgorgement of the illegal gains through an interim order. The regulator also banned the five entities from the market until its investigation is over and a further order is passed.Spoofing is an illegal technique where the perpetrator, the spoofer, places a huge order (buy/sell) for a stock at a substantially higher or lower price than the prevailing market price. The spoofing order is an open order, meaning the order size and the price are visible to everyone looking at the order book, which shows how many shares are up for buying and how many for selling.Subsequent to the first order, the spoofer also places an order for a substantially smaller volume on the opposite side of the original order at a price closer to the market price. By executing the second order, the spoofer makes a profit by playing on the psychology of the market players. Under Sebi rules, spoofing is an attempt to manipulate stock prices and an illegal act.The investigation by the regulator found that over three years, people at Patel Wealth Advisors attempted spoofing in 193 stocks with a combined 292 attempts. In one of those cases, the broker put in 548 buy orders, of which 543 were spoofing orders for nearly 5.4 crore shares of Coffee Day at an average of 20-26% below the market order. These were fully disclosed. It executed just five orders aggregating about 52,000 shares at prices very close to the then prevailing market price.

NEW DELHI: Industrial output growth improved marginally in March, led by the electricity and manufacturing sectors, but mining remained a drag while the overall number for the crucial data remained sluggish.Data released by the National Statistical Office (NSO) on Monday showed the index of industrial production (IIP) rose an annual 3% in March compared to the downwardly revised six-month low of 2.7% in Feb and below the 5.5% in March last year. For the full fiscal year (2024-25), IIP growth was at 4% compared to the 5.9% in the previous fiscal year.The electricity sector grew by 6.3% in March compared with the 3.6% in Feb but below the 8.6% in March last year. The manufacturing sector rose by 3% in March, marginally above the 2.8% in Feb but below the 5.9% in March last year.The mining sector remained sluggish, growing 0.4% in March compared to 1.6% in Feb and below the 1.3% in March last year.

MUMBAI: RBI has announced a fresh round of bond purchases to support liquidity in the banking system. In May, it will buy Rs 1.25 lakh crore of govt securities through open market operations (OMOs). The programme, to be conducted in four tranches, begins with a Rs 50,000-crore auction on May 6, followed by three smaller auctions of Rs 25,000 crore each later in the month.The move extends liquidity-easing efforts launched in April, when RBI conducted a Rs 40,000-crore OMO and a Rs 1.5-lakh-crore variable rate repo operation, alongside two smaller OMOs. The central bank said the decision reflected its assessment of ""current and evolving liquidity conditions"". While RBI's language was cautious, the scale and sequencing of its interventions suggest an intent to maintain banking system liquidity at a comfortable level, possibly near the 1% of banks' net demand and time liabilities as stated by governor Sanjay Malhotra in his post-policy conference this month.","In May, it will buy Rs 1.25 lakh crore of govt securities through open market operations (OMOs) The programme, to be conducted in four tranches, begins with a Rs 50,000-crore auction on May 6.

Govt reviews cargo hit from shut Pak airspace,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/govt-reviews-cargo-hit-from-shut-pak-airspace/articleshow/120712954.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: Govt is assessing the impact of Pakistan's airspace closure on air cargo from India that is headed to the Gulf, Europe, and the US. Exporters suggest that the impact is not going to be significant. While most of the cargo moves by sea, around 3-4% of garments are exported on aircraft, either on passenger planes or freighters, with some gems and jewellery also taking that route. Similarly, some electronics are moved by planes, as are some perishables. However, exporters said the quantity is not significant enough to cause any major disruption.Govt's decision to ban the transshipment of cargo from Bangladesh will also help soften prices in India. Some pressure is expected towards the end of May, when some shipments will be front-loaded ahead of the July 9 deadline for reciprocal tariffs to kick in. When Trump announced tariffs at the start of April, companies rushed to ship goods to beat the deadline, with Apple shipping five plane-loads of products. Garment buyers and gems and jewellery exporters also saw large quantities of goods being shipped from India by air.The pressure on freight reduced after US President Donald Trump paused reciprocal tariffs for 90 days, along with a sharp fall in shipments from China. The Drewry WCI composite index fell 2% to $2,157 for 40-foot containers during the week ended April 24, with the rates from China seeing the sharpest fall in the wake of the tariff war. On a year-on-year basis, New York-Rotterdam rates have risen 32% but are down 36% for Rotterdam-Shanghai and 24% for Shanghai-Rotterdam. Freight rates from Shanghai to New York decreased 3% or $95 to $3,611 per 40ft container during the week ended April 24. Those from Shanghai to Los Angeles and Rotterdam to Shanghai fell 2% to $2,617 and $481 per 40ft container, respectively. However, rates for containers from New York to Rotterdam rose 1% to $825, while costs on Shanghai-Genoa and Los Angeles-Shanghai routes remained stable.""Drewry expects rates to continue to decline in the coming week due to uncertainty stemming from reciprocal tariffs,"" the maritime research and consulting firm said.","Govt is assessing the impact of Pakistan's airspace closure on air cargo from India.

US-China trade war: Why Xi Jinping is 'ghosting' Donald Trump,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-china-trade-war-why-is-xi-jinping-ghosting-trump/articleshow/120699528.cms,"AI image for representation only.

Why it matters

The ""ghosting"" of President Donald Trump by Xi Jinping isn't just a diplomatic snub - it’s a flashing warning light for the global economy and for Trump’s own high-risk strategy.

Without direct leader-to-leader dialogue, there’s no clear pathway to de-escalating the intensifying tariff war that now threatens to spill over into broader economic and geopolitical instability.

Trump’s tariffs, now reaching up to 145% on Chinese goods, are beginning to bite US businesses, consumers, and markets - and China’s refusal to engage suggests it’s ready to absorb the pain longer than Washington anticipated.

Moreover, Trump’s credibility is under fire: repeated claims of private talks with Xi - now publicly denied by Beijing and questioned even by his own treasury secretary Scott Bessent - raise doubts about the administration's messaging and negotiating leverage.

The lack of direct communication raises risks that miscalculations, nationalist sentiment, and political pressures on both sides could drive the two largest economies into a full-blown economic war - without an off-ramp or diplomatic buffer.

In short: If Trump can't get Xi on the phone, he may not be able to get a deal at all - and the fallout could be devastating not just for the US and China, but for the entire global economy.

I have great respect for President Xi. He’s been a friend of mine for a long period of time, and I think that we’ll end up working out something that’s very good for both countries Donald Trump

The big picture

What they're saying

""It basically means that it signals weaknesses and vulnerability to possible political opponents,"" Sun said.

""I don't think the two have communicated directly with each other since January 17,"" added Kennedy.

Bethany Allen of the Australian Strategic Policy Institute put it bluntly: ""Trump is known for off-handed comments that may be somewhat less than precise.""

“They make up bargaining chips out of thin air, bully and go back on their words, which makes everyone see one thing more and more clearly, that is the so-called ‘reciprocal tariffs’ severely go against historical trends and economic laws, impact international trade rules and order and seriously impair the legitimate rights and interests of countries,” said Zhao Chenxin, deputy director of the National Development and Reform Commission, China’s main economic planning agency.

We'll see what happens with China. It's important. I think it's unsustainable from the Chinese side. So maybe they'll call me one day. US treasury secretary Scott Bessent

Between the lines

Xi ""fears being treated like Zelenskyy,""

Zoom in

What's next?

The bottom line

China on Monday firmly denied that President Xi Jinping has recently spoken to Donald Trump, directly contradicting the US president's public assertions that tariff talks are underway.""As far as I know, there has been no phone call between the two heads of state recently,"" Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun told reporters in Beijing. ""China and the United States are not conducting consultations or negotiations on tariff issues.""The Chinese Embassy in Washington doubled down: “China and the US are NOT having any consultation or negotiation on #tariffs. The US should stop creating confusion.”Trump, speaking to Time magazine, claimed Xi had ""called"" him to discuss tariffs, implying progress in talks. He repeated that assertion at the White House while leaving for Pope Francis’s funeral in Rome.China immediately shot down the claim, and analysts quickly piled on skepticism.Treasury secretary Scott Bessent said on ABC’s “This Week” that he was unaware of any Xi-Trump conversation, despite maintaining that they ""have a very good relationship.""As per ABC news, multiple China watchers - including Xin Sun at King's College London and Scott Kennedy at the Center for Strategic and International Studies - agreed it’s ""highly unlikely"" Xi would make such a call, arguing that doing so under pressure would ""signal weakness"" and could endanger Xi’s political standing at home.Trump’s go-to diplomatic playbook - escalate conflict, then pivot to a man-to-man leader summit - has run aground with Xi.Ryan Hass of the Brookings Institution told the New York Times: ""China’s leaders do not view tit-for-tat tariffs as an isolated trade issue that lends itself to a negotiated resolution.""Instead, Beijing is choosing strategic patience: absorbing the economic shock, projecting strength, and waiting for Trump's political hand to weaken.Yun Sun at the Stimson Center noted thatreferencing a disastrous Trump-Zelenskyy press conference earlier this year that left Ukraine’s leader humiliated. ""The mess about the call is a total contest of egos,"" she told the NYT.As per a Reuters report, the trade war between the world’s two largest economies risks pushing the US into a recession, with global consequences. Meanwhile, China is trying to revive its growth after pandemic-related job losses and economic shocks.Economists at the International Monetary Fund and several investment firms have lowered their growth forecasts for China this year to around 4%. Millions of export-focused jobs could be affected.Despite this, Chinese officials say they are confident the economy can meet its target of about 5% growth this year, matching the pace of 2024.Yu Jiadong, a vice minister of Human Resources and Social Security, told reporters in Beijing that a full and objective analysis shows China's “employment policy toolbox is sufficient.”The government plans to boost support for businesses to retain workers and promote entrepreneurship among the unemployed, Yu said.China can also handle losing US energy imports, according to Zhao, the deputy director of the NDRC.“Enterprises reducing or even stopping energy imports from the United States will have no impact on our country’s energy supply,” he said.China’s Politburo last week opted against new deficit spending, aiming to maintain ""composure"" rather than react rashly to Trump's tariffs.Growth risks are real. Analysts estimate China may still need a 2 trillion yuan stimulus injection if growth falters further.Yet officials insist new stimulus measures are ""ready but not rushed,"" according to policy insiders speaking anonymously to Reuters.Larry Hu, chief China economist at Macquarie, said: ""It's much easier for Trump to walk back his tariff threat than it is for Beijing to walk back a stimulus announcement.""China appears to be betting that the political and economic pain from high tariffs will cause Trump to blink first.Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley and other banks expect Beijing to roll out 1–1.5 trillion yuan in fresh stimulus in the second half of the year if necessary, though they caution that even that may not fully offset the damage from US tariffs.In Washington, the Trump administration is divided: Peter Navarro, Trump’s longtime China hawk, is content with frozen talks and even favors a slow-motion economic decoupling. Treasury aecretary Scott Bessent and commerce secretary Howard Lutnick urge cautious engagement, believing ""a lot of confidence"" exists between Trump and Xi personally.Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, weighed in this week: “It doesn’t have to wait a year. It could start tomorrow.”Xi’s cold shoulder to Trump reflects not just a tactical delay but a fundamental shift: China believes it can ride out the trade war without making immediate concessions.As per the NYT, Trump’s dream of a personal ""bromance"" with Xi is slipping away, leaving the US economy exposed to escalating tariffs without an easy diplomatic off-ramp.(With inputs from agencies)","China denies that President Xi Jinping has recently spoken to Donald Trump. China's refusal to engage suggests it's ready to absorb the pain longer than Washington anticipated. If Trump can't get Xi on the phone, he may not be able to get a deal at all.

US markets opened modestly higher Monday morning as investors entered a busy week filled with major corporate earnings and crucial economic indicators. Despite lingering concerns over global trade and macroeconomic uncertainty, early gains suggested a cautiously optimistic tone on Wall Street As of 1.04 pm EDT, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) plunged 132.11 points, or 0.33%, to 39,981.39. The S&P 500 was down 41.94 points or 0.76%, to trade at 5,483.03.

Oil prices edged slightly lower, with US crude slipping 7 cents to $62.95 per barrel, down 0.11%.Bond yields ticked up, with the US 10-year Treasury yield rising 1.6 basis points to 4.282%, reflecting cautious optimism about the economic outlook.

Domino's referred to the current global macroeconomic environment as “challenging.”Trump's on-again-off-again tariffs may have pushed households and businesses to alter their spending and freeze plans for long-term investment because of how quickly conditions could change, seemingly by the hour.Despite a market rally last week, as talk of Trump firing Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell receded and hints emerged of a selective softening of his stance on tariffs, not much had changed, Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management said.“But let’s not kid ourselves: this wasn’t a clean pivot,"" Innes said. ""It was hope and narrative management, plain and simple. What was really driving the bounce wasn’t hard policy action — it was the perception of de-escalation.""Trump had said he was on a path to cut several new trade deals in a few weeks, but had also suggested it was “physically impossible” to hold all the needed meetings.The hope was that if Trump rolled back some of his stiff tariffs, he could avert a recession that many investors saw as otherwise likely because of his trade war.Shares of Deliveroo, the food delivery service based in London, had hit three-year highs after it received a $3.6 billion takeover offer from DoorDash.

Donald Trump’s tariff hit: How Chinese firms are looking at Indian exporters to maintain their US clientele,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/donald-trumps-tariff-hit-how-chinese-firms-are-looking-at-indian-exporters-to-maintain-their-us-clientele/articleshow/120693812.cms,"AI-generated image (Credit: Bing image creator)

NEW DELHI: China-based enterprises, impacted by escalating US tariffs imposed under Donald Trump administration, are seeking assistance from Indian exporters to maintain their American clientele amid significant disruptions in global trade.During the recently concluded Canton Fair in Guangzhou (May 5), several Chinese firms approached Indian companies to help fulfil US customer orders, according to Ajay Sahai, Director General of the Federation of Indian Export Organizations (FIEO), as reported by Bloomberg. Indian firms are expected to receive commissions for facilitating these transactions.The US has imposed tariffs of up to 145 per cent on Chinese exports, while Indian goods currently face a 10 per cent levy, scheduled to rise to 26 per cent in July if President Donald Trump implements reciprocal tariffs after a 90-day pause.Previously, Chinese exporters had established operations in Vietnam or routed goods through Thailand to reach US markets. However, Trump’s imposition of 46 per cent tariffs on Vietnam has limited these alternatives, potentially opening up more opportunities for Indian exporters.Due to India's restrictions on Chinese investments, Chinese firms cannot establish operations or use India as a mere transit point.Instead, Chinese companies at the Canton Fair proposed that Indian firms supply goods under Chinese brands or through co-branding arrangements, Sahai said.Enquiries primarily came from sectors such as hand tools, electronics, and home appliances. Sahai noted that direct negotiations between US customers and Indian suppliers are also likely, with commission structures for Chinese firms determined during buyer-supplier discussions.""Some four to five companies have approached us,"" said Siddhant Aggarwal, export officer at Jalandhar-based OayKay Tools, a manufacturer of drop forge hammers and cold stamp machines. ""They have a brand name to maintain, so they need to service their customers.""India’s growing export opportunities coincide with advancing trade discussions with the Trump administration. During a recent visit to India, US Vice President JD Vance reaffirmed prospects for a bilateral trade deal, targeted for completion by autumn.Meanwhile, US-China tensions over tariffs remain high. Beijing has dismissed the high levies as ""meaningless,"" while Trump claims negotiations are ongoing. However, China denies any active discussions, reiterating demands for the removal of unilateral tariffs.While American attendance was relatively low at the start of the Canton Fair, tariff concerns dominated discussions. Many Chinese firms, facing the 90-day grace period, accelerated investments in Southeast Asia to bypass US restrictions.Jalandhar-based Victor Forgings, established in 1954, is optimistic about growth amid the evolving trade landscape. Managing Partner Ashwani Kumar said the company has been approached by both Chinese suppliers and US firms with Chinese operations seeking alternatives due to supply chain disruptions . Kumar also revealed plans to set up two new manufacturing units to meet rising demand, noting that American firms are willing to share technical expertise to help Indian manufacturers expand capacity.Meanwhile, in its trade war with US, China asserted on Monday that it maintained a righteous position in its ongoing trade dispute with the United States. The US levied a substantial 145 percent duty on its primary competitor, whilst China retaliated with a 125 percent duty on American products.During a press conference, senior Chinese economic official, Zhao Chenxin , warned that the US trade conflict would have adverse consequences. ""We firmly believe that if you are against the world and the truth, you will only isolate yourselves. Only by travelling with the world and with morality can we win the future.""According to AFP, Chenxin criticised the US for its unilateral actions and intimidation tactics, stating they created ""cards out of thin air, bully and go back on their word.""Additionally, Beijing announced enhanced measures to protect China's declining economy from the effects of this confrontation. Chenxin further declared China's commitment to persist ""to the end.""Read more: China claims it is on the ‘right side of history’ in escalating trade war with US","Several Chinese firms approached Indian companies to help fulfil US customer orders.

The revised document, seen by The Associated Press, now emphasises reducing ideological bias to enhance economic competitiveness.Technology professionals are accustomed to adapting their work to changing Washington priorities.According to the Associated Press, this transition concerns field experts, including Harvard University sociologist Ellis Monk, who previously assisted Google in developing more inclusive AI products.The technology sector had recognised issues with computer vision AI, particularly regarding image recognition.These systems showed promise commercially but reflected historical prejudices similar to earlier photographic technologies that poorly represented Black and brown individuals.Google implemented Monk's colour scale, improving AI image tools' representation of diverse skin tones, replacing an older standard designed for white dermatology patients.""Consumers definitely had a huge positive response to the changes,"" he said. Monk considers the future of such initiatives uncertain.While his Monk Skin Tone Scale remains secure within numerous products at Google and elsewhere - including camera phones, video games, AI image generators - he and colleagues worry about reduced support for future inclusive technology development.""Google wants their products to work for everybody, in India, China, Africa, et cetera. That part is kind of DEI-immune,"" Monk told the Associated Press.""But could future funding for those kinds of projects be lowered? Absolutely, when the political mood shifts and when there's a lot of pressure to get to market very quickly,"" Monk added.The Trump administration has cut hundreds of science, technology, and health funding grants related to DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) themes, though his impact on the commercial development of chatbots and other AI products has been more indirect.Meanwhile, Republican Rep.

In areas heavily frequented by tourists, local governments are being encouraged to establish immediate refund points for faster service.Speaking at a news conference, Vice Minister of Commerce Sheng Qiuping said inbound tourism spending made up only about 0.5% of China’s GDP in 2024, far below the 1%–3% range seen in other major economies—signalling room for growth. He noted that foreign tourist spending in China surged to $94.2 billion last year, marking a 77.8% increase.China’s economy grew by 5.4% year-on-year in the first quarter, buoyed by strong export activity ahead of fresh US tariffs. However, analysts expect a slowdown as tariffs of up to 145% on Chinese goods take hold.

TikTok to launch e-commerce platform in Japan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/tiktok-to-launch-e-commerce-platform-in-japan/articleshow/120661332.cms,"TikTok is preparing to launch its e-commerce platform, TikTok Shop, in Japan, allowing users to sell products via livestreams. This move follows its recent expansion into Europe and is part of TikTok's strategy to diversify its business amid regulatory challenges in the US, where its future remains uncertain due to divestiture requirements.

TikTok, the popular Chinese social media platform, is gearing up to enter Japan’s online shopping market in the coming months, according to a report by Nikkei on Sunday.The company plans to recruit sellers soon for its e-commerce arm, TikTok Shop, which will offer a platform for users to sell products ranging from sneakers to beauty items through livestreams, earning commissions on sales, Reuters reported.This expansion into Japan follows TikTok Shop’s recent moves into Europe, where it launched in France, Germany, and Italy earlier this year, continuing its global push.

"Roche could have earned over 100 times what it cost for rare disease drug, estimate activists",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/roche-could-have-earned-over-100-times-what-it-cost-for-rare-disease-drug-estimate-activists/articleshow/120624790.cms,"File photo: AP

Pharma major Roche may have earned over a hundred times what risdiplam , a drug used to treat spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), should cost to bring to market, according to calculations by public health activists.After Roche declined to share information on the cost of clinical trials, Knowledge Ecology International (KEI), a US-based non-profit working on access to affordable medicines, calculated the costs and pegged them at about $50 million. Roche earned $5.8 billion from the sale of risdiplam in the 2021-2024 period, about 115 times the calculated cost.In response to the calculations sent to it by KEI, Roche stated: “Only a small fraction of projects make it ‘from bench to bedside’ and we have to absorb the cost of failing projects as well, while your calculation only addresses successful development. Similarly, our dedication to innovation extends to the continuous development of next-generation therapies—a commitment clearly reflected in our ongoing development work of new treatments in SMA. ”The three trials of risdiplam cited in the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) involved 467 participants. The four trials with a start date before FDA approval involved 120 participants. KEI estimated per patient cost of conducting the trial by combining several data sources on the cost of conducting clinical trials.The United States provides a tax credit for qualifying clinical trials for rare diseases. After calculating the cost of the clinical trials, when KEI applied the orphan drug tax credit to the trial cost, the net cost ranged from $11 million to $25 million.Clinical trials typically constitute 60-70% of drug development costs.Roche was also awarded a Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher (PRV) in August 2020. The PRV is an incentive designed to encourage development of drugs and biologics for serious or life-threatening rare diseases. The PRV allows earlier market entry and extends the effective period of the monopoly by several months. The PRV can be sold to third parties. In 2020, the market value of a PRV was roughly $100 million, more than the Roche outlays on trials, pointed out KEI.Since 2003, when it was established, the Spinal Muscular Atrophy Foundation (SMAF) has invested $100 million to develop drugs for this condition. Roche paid $30 million dollars to get an exclusive worldwide license to PTC Therapeutics' SMA programme, which it had developed in collaboration with SMAF.Roche’s costs of manufacturing the drug are not significant, with a year of treatment requiring less than 2 grams of risdiplam, which can probably be manufactured by Roche at less than $50,000 per kilo, or $50 per gram, estimated KEI. In India, the treatment with risdiplam typically costs Rs 72 lakh per adult patient per year, which is unaffordable for most.According to Roche’s response to TOI, as of October 2024, of the 168 patients receiving Roche’s treatment for SMA, 56 continued to be treated for free under the company’s Compassionate User Program (CUP), 53 were covered under various government policies -- Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS), Defence, Employee State Insurance (ESI) and Railways -- and the remaining 59 purchased the drug under Roche’s Patient Access Program, launched in 2021, “under which Roche provides free bottles of the treatment for every bottle that is purchased”.Cure SMA, a trust formed by parents of children with SMA, has 1,800 patients registered and the government portal for rare disease has 700 SMA patients registered.Lack of affordability has made patients approach courts to help bring down costs through local manufacture or through price negotiation by the government. Roche has opposed generic manufacture of the drug by an Indian company. A bottle of risdiplam costs Rs 2 lakh in India while it costs just Rs 44,700 in China and Rs 41,000 in Pakistan, according to an affidavit filed by an SMA patient in court. The Indian generic manufacturer, NATCO, has pegged the cost at Rs 15,900 per bottle with scope for further reduction if the government purchased it in bulk.“On average, it takes ten years to develop a new drug and only one out of ten drugs in early development will eventually make it to patients. And it is very complex to estimate the total cost of developing a new medicine, especially for extremely rare neurological diseases such as SMA. The cost of development goes well beyond preclinical research, clinical trials, and post-marketing studies, requiring many years of investment. There are also costs associated with ensuring safe and quality manufacturing setup and operations, and building a global and local infrastructure to ensure access around the world.,” stated Roche in its response to TOI.","Roche earned $5.8 billion from the sale of risdiplam in the 2021-2024 period, about 115 times the calculated cost.

California has overtaken Japan in terms of its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) — a milestone highlighted by Governor Gavin Newsom , who warned that President Donald Trump's tariff policies could endanger the state’s growing prosperity.According to preliminary figures from the US Bureau of Economic Analysis, California posted a nominal gross domestic product (GDP) of $4.1 trillion in 2024. This is higher than Japan’s $4.02 trillion GDP for the same period, as reported by the International Monetary Fund.This places California just behind the United States, China and Germany in total economic output, with the state’s economy growing by 6 per cent in 2024 — outpacing all three of those nations.“California isn’t just keeping pace with the world — we’re setting the pace,” Newsom said in a statement Wednesday according to CNN. “Our economy is thriving because we invest in people, prioritise sustainability, and believe in the power of innovation.”However, Newsom cautioned that the state’s economic progress is under threat from what he called “the reckless tariff policies of the current federal administration.”“California’s economy powers the nation, and it must be protected,” he added.Also read: Donald Trump tariffs to hit global economy hard!

The suit argues that these measures are inflicting economic harm on California’s businesses and residents.The legal filing contests Trump’s authority to enact tariffs on key trading partners — Mexico, China and Canada — under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), citing a 10 per cent blanket tariff on all imports. Newsom's team argues the move is “unlawful and unprecedented” without congressional approval.Enacted in 1977, the IEEPA grants presidents broad powers to implement economic sanctions during national emergencies, but requires consultation with Congress.California recorded $675 billion in two-way trade in 2024, with Mexico, Canada and China serving as its primary trading partners. These three countries alone accounted for over 40 per cent of the state’s imports — $203 billion of the $491 billion total.Twelve other states joined California in filing lawsuits on Wednesday, accusing the Trump administration of implementing tariffs that amount to illegal tax hikes. The White House dismissed the coordinated legal challenge as a “witch hunt.”","California has overtaken Japan in terms of its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) Governor Gavin Newsom warned that President Donald Trump's tariff policies could endanger the state’s growing prosperity.

In a policy shift aimed at accelerating US leadership in autonomous vehicle technology , the Trump administration is easing federal safety regulations to help domestic automakers like Elon Musk ’s Tesla stay ahead of Chinese rivals.The US department of transportation on Thursday unveiled a new framework that allows American companies to seek exemptions from certain safety rules when testing self-driving cars for non-commercial purposes—such as research and public demonstrations.""We’re in a race with China to out-innovate, and the stakes couldn’t be higher,” said Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy in a statement, justifying the move. “Our new framework will slash red tape and move us closer to a single national standard ,"" he added.The move is intended to give US automakers greater flexibility as they push to develop fully autonomous vehicles.The administration is also revising crash reporting requirements for self-driving systems, a move directly addressing longstanding complaints from Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who has argued the rules are overly burdensome. Tesla, as the leading seller of partially automated vehicles in the US, has been disproportionately impacted by current reporting demands.While the obligation to report crashes will remain, the Transportation Department says it will be “loosened” to remove “unnecessary and duplicative” requirements—striking a balance between regulatory oversight and technological progress.The announcement comes just a day after Musk told investors that Tesla will begin rolling out self-driving taxis in Austin, Texas, this June. As China’s BYD and other rivals rapidly scale up their autonomous vehicle programs, the pressure is mounting on the US to respond.Previously, such exemptions were granted primarily to foreign vehicles entering the US market whose home-country regulations differed from those in the US.Also read: ‘India a very hot market but...’: Elon Musk-led Tesla says 100% car tariffs make customers anxious The incentive for Tesla comes just days after the automaker reported a stark drop of 71 per cent in profits in its Q1 earnings report.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume.

The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021.

The Series A funding round was led by Lightspeed Venture Partners , and participants included Silicon Valley billionaire Vinod Khosla’s Khosla Ventures and Peak XV Partners , formerly Sequoia Capital India & Southeast Asia, Sarvam said Thursday.The Bangalore-based startup, until recently in stealth mode, was co-founded by Vivek Raghavan and Pratyush Kumar. It has ambitious plans to build open source foundational AI systems as well as tools for creating apps for the meager compute infrastructure available to developers in India. The startup has a total of 18 employees and is just opening an office in the city.""What we are showing is that you can build large language models with limited resources,” Raghavan said in a phone interview. ""We are building at a smaller scale and demonstrating that these can be extremely cost and energy efficient so they can be accessed by everyone.""Large language models, like OpenAI’s GPT-4 and Meta Platforms Inc.’s Llama, are powerful AI systems that understand by learning from vast amounts of diverse data from the internet and elsewhere to summarize, translate, and create text, audio and video for a wide range of applications. The rivalry to develop ever-more sophisticated models is heating up in Silicon Valley and such efforts have attracted billions of dollars in investments.","Sarvam AI is building large language models targeted at unique uses in Indian languages at price points that the country’s 1.4 billion people can afford.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor ( CEA ) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart.

That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says.

Tax on cigarettes, tobacco products

India may explore increasing the goods and service tax (GST) on tobacco products, including cigarettes, after it stops levying the compensation cess on them.Tobacco products, including cigarettes and pan masala, contribute substantially to government tax collections, with revenue reaching ₹72,788 crore during 2022-23.Currently, tobacco products are subject to 28% GST along with cess and additional levies, amounting to 53% total indirect tax. A proposal under consideration involves elevating GST to 40%, the maximum allowable rate, plus an additional excise duty, according to an ET report.The objective is to maintain tax revenue from these products after the compensation cess ends on March 31, 2026. Officials indicate that introducing another cess to replace the compensation cess is not preferred.A GST Council-appointed ministerial group tasked with examining the post-2026 compensation cess scenario will analyse these proposals. Officials note that cess is not considered an efficient taxation method.These sin goods presently attract compensation cess, basic excise duty, National Calamity Contingent Duty, and 28% GST.The current combined taxation of 53% remains significantly lower than the World Health Organization's recommended rate of 75%.Officials indicated to the financial daily that whilst replacing compensation cess with a health cess is being considered, several states and the central government are hesitant about introducing a new cess structure.Also Read | More tax relief coming?

"Trump's tariffs: India’s GDP may take 0.1-0.6% hit from US tariff moves, says Goldman Sachs",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/trumps-tariffs-indias-gdp-may-take-0-1-0-6-hit-from-us-tariff-moves-says-goldman-sachs/articleshow/118523127.cms,"Trump has specifically mentioned India alongside the European Union and China, stating that India maintained ""the highest tariffs in the world"".

India-US Trade Dynamics:

India's two-way goods trade surplus with the US has seen a twofold increase in the past decade, rising from $17bn (0.9% of India's GDP) in FY14 (fiscal year runs from April to March) to $35bn (1.0% of GDP) in FY24.

The surge is primarily attributed to heightened trade surplus in electronic items, following the implementation of fiscal incentives through the PLI scheme in 2020.

India's Goods Trade Surplus with the US

The tariff structure shows India maintaining higher rates compared to the US across most product categories, with notable differences observed in agricultural products, textiles, and pharmaceutical products.

Weighted Average Effective US Tariff

Goldman Sachs outlines three potential implementation approaches for the ""reciprocal tariff"" scheme:

1. Country-level reciprocity:

2. Product-level reciprocity:

3. Reciprocity including non-tariff barriers:

India's gross exports to the US

The analysis considers various scenarios, incorporating different levels of US tariff increases on Indian imports and utilising elasticity estimates from existing research. The calculations suggest that these tariff adjustments could reduce India's GDP growth by 0.1-0.3 percentage points across different scenarios.

According to Goldman Sachs, when India's gross exports to the US amount to approximately 2% of GDP, and considering an 11.5 percentage point rise in average US effective tariff rates on Indian imports with a price elasticity estimate of -0.5, the resultant GDP impact would be 0.12 percentage points (2%*11.5*-0.5=-0.12pp).

Potential impact on GDP

In the scenario where the US implements a universal reciprocal tariff across all nations, the appropriate indicator for evaluating a domestic economy's US exposure would be the domestic value added content in gross exports to US final demand, as per the OECD's Trade in Value-Added Database.

This indicator precisely measures a country's domestic activity exposure to the US. With India's domestic value added content in gross exports at approximately 4.0% of GDP, it positions itself centrally amongst its Asian counterparts. Using this measurement, the potential impact on domestic GDP growth, considering a 6.5-11.5 percentage point increase in US average effective tariff rates, would likely fall between 0.1 and 0.6 percentage points.

India in middle of spectrum

Impact of US tariffs on India: India’s GDP may take a hit of around 0.1 to 0.6 percentage points due to the proposed US tariffs, according to a recent Goldman Sachs analysis. The study examines scenarios of US tariff implementation: country-level and product-level reciprocity.It states, ""India's domestic activity exposure to US final demand would be roughly twice as high (4.0 per cent of GDP) given exposure to the US via exports to other countries, and would likely result in a potential domestic GDP growth impact of 0.1-0.6pp.""Should the US administration opt to raise tariffs on all imports by the average tariff differential between specific countries and itself, the effective US tariff rates on Indian imports would see an increase of 6.5 percentage points, it says.On February 13, President Trump directed his team to create a ""Fair and Reciprocal Plan"". The subsequent memo outlined a strategy to equalise tariffs, taxes and non-tariff barriers with other nations. During his February 13 press conference, Trump specifically mentioned India alongside the European Union and China, stating that India maintained ""the highest tariffs in the world"".Also Read | 'More of white noise': Why Trump’s reciprocal tariffs on India’s exports to US will have a ‘limited’ impact The first approach involves country-level reciprocity, where the US administration could raise tariffs on all imports by the average tariff difference between a specific country and the US. This would result in approximately 6.5 percentage points increase in US effective tariff rates on Indian imports. The US economics team suggests this as the most straightforward implementation method, allowing officials to apply a single uniform rate per country on existing tariff rates.The second method focuses on product-level reciprocity, where the US administration would equalise tariff rates on individual products with those imposed by trading partners. This could lead to roughly 11.5 percentage points increase in US effective tariff rates on Indian imports. This approach requires more complex administration and longer implementation periods. A White House memo dated February 13 requires the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to provide a report to the President within 180 days.The third approach encompasses reciprocity including non-tariff barriers, such as administrative obstacles, import licensing requirements, and export subsidies. This represents the most complex implementation method due to difficulties in calculating non-tariff barrier costs for each trading partner. Consequently, the analysis focuses solely on tariff-related barriers.Goldman Sachs’ assessment of India's vulnerability to US tariff changes begins with examining export exposure. India's exports to the US accounted for approximately 2.0% of its GDP in 2023, representing one of the smallest exposures amongst emerging market economies.Also Read | Tesla India entry: Why Donald Trump has said it would be ‘very unfair’ for Elon Musk’s Tesla to set up a factory in India The key factor in determining the economic impact lies in understanding how responsive Indian exports are to US tariff adjustments, specifically focusing on the price elasticity of American demand for Indian goods.","India's two-way goods trade surplus with the US has seen a twofold increase in the past decade, rising from $17bn (0.9% of India's GDP) to $35bn (1.0% of GDP) in FY24.

New Income Tax Bill 2025 : Representing a historic milestone in India’s tax landscape, Hon. Finance Minister – Madam Nirmala Sitharaman has presented the Income Tax Bill, 2025 (Bill) in the Parliament on 13 February 2025.The current Income tax law - Income Tax Act, 1961 (the current Act) was enacted more than six decades ago. With passage of time there were multiple amendments made to the law. Many believed this resulted in the current Act becoming difficult to read, complex to interpret and resulted in unwarranted litigation as well. Hence, it was indeed an opportune time to embark on an exercise to simplify the same. While an attempt was made to this effect a decade ago with the draft Direct Tax Code (DTC) – it never became legislation.Globally as well, countries like the UK, Australia etc., had undertaken similar exercises to enhance clarity and compliance in their taxation laws. Hence, a new simplified income tax law in India was definitely the need of the hour.Also Read | ITR filing with latest income tax slabs post Budget 2025: Will taxpayers with income below Rs 12 lakh have to file tax return? The Bill is prepared by investing more than 60,000 man-hours and has 23 chapters and 2.6 lakh words in comparison to 46 chapters and 5.12 lakh words respectively when compared with the Current Act. The number of Sections has also dramatically reduced from 800 plus sections to 536 Sections only.Secondly the language used in the Bill at many places is extremely lucid and is reader friendly as it has tables and formulas as against the traditional verbose style.One of the most significant aspects of the Bill is the elimination of the concepts of ‘previous year’ and ‘assessment year’. India is trying to join the league of comparable tax jurisdictions by using one single term ‘tax year’. The current terms of previous year and assessment year was apparently leading to mistakes by taxpayers while filing forms/ challans etc. With now only one term “tax year” it will hopefully avoid confusion.Largely, there are no changes to the definition of residency or even salary related provisions for that matter. In fact the choice of the two tax regimes continues to be available to individual taxpayers. There is no change to the tax rates and capital gains tax regime also remains the same.Also Read | New Income Tax Bill 2025 explained: Top 30 FAQs every taxpayer should check TDS and TCS provisions have been made easier to comprehend by providing tables instead of the existing provisions which have lengthy texts that are open to interpretation issues and quite often difficult to understand. The Bill now also gives the ability for individuals to apply for a Lower or NIL rate of TCS while they purchase a car, pay for foreign tour, or make remittance abroad under the Liberalised Remittance Scheme (LRS) of the Reserve Bank of India.It is also interesting to note that elaborate provisions have been enunciated for dealing with transition from the current Act to the new law.There is a clear focus on encouragement of compliance with the mantra of “Trust first, scrutinize later” – as stated by Hon. FM in her recent Feb 2025 Budget speech.As and when the Bill is enacted, the administrative measures for implementing them will be made operational (e.g., publishing of rules, IT infrastructure revamp etc.), keeping in mind the convenience of taxpayers and all stakeholders. For the common man, it is anticipated that the Bill will help in easy understanding of law and smoother tax compliances.","The current Income tax law - Income Tax Act, 1961 (the current Act) was enacted more than six decades ago.

MUMBAI: India's technology sector is set to emerge as a $300-billion business in the 2025-26 financial year, growing 6% over the previous year, tech industry body Nasscom said. The sector logged 5.1% growth, contributing an additional $13.8 billion in revenue, reaching a total of $282.6 billion in the 2024-25 fiscal year. Nasscom restated the tech sector number to $268.8 billion in the 2023-24 financial year from the $254 billion it called out previously.India's tech sector, which has a 7.3% relative share of India's GDP, has played a significant role in shaping the country's economy.

The services sector outperformed manufacturing in both sales and profit growth, reversing the trend from FY23 when sales grew faster than profits.Despite sluggish sales, operating expenses rose 3.4% in FY24, mainly due to slower growth in manufacturing costs. Employee remuneration also grew at a slower pace, with the slowdown seen across both manufacturing and services.

Operating profit in manufacturing rose 13.2%, while the services sector saw a 15.5% increase.Sales growth in manufacturing and services declined to 4.1% and 6.8%, respectively, in FY24 from double-digit growth the previous year. Manufacturing sales were dragged down by a contraction in metals, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and coke and refined petroleum products.

Vatican’s response

Pope Francis's condition has worsened, Vatican says | ABS CBN News

What happens if the pope becomes incapacitated?

What's next?

Pope Francis remains in a critical condition, raising urgent questions about the Vatican's leadership and the future of the Catholic Church. The 88-year-old pontiff has been hospitalised at Rome’s Gemelli Hospital since February 14, initially admitted with bronchitis, which later worsened into double pneumonia. The Vatican confirmed he suffered a prolonged respiratory crisis requiring high-flow oxygen and blood transfusions, while tests revealed thrombocytopenia associated with anaemia, further complicating his recovery.Despite his condition, Francis remains alert, though visibly weaker, as reported by news agency AFP. The Vatican’s latest update stated that his prognosis remains uncertain. The pope’s ongoing health concerns have reignited discussions about the possibility of resignation, following in the footsteps of Pope Benedict XVI, who stepped down in 2013 due to deteriorating health. However, Francis has repeatedly insisted that he sees the papacy as a lifelong commitment.While Pope Francis remains the head of the Catholic Church, the day-to-day operations of the Vatican continue under the leadership of Secretary of State Cardinal Pietro Parolin and other senior officials. Vatican governance remains intact, with Parolin initially overseas but now back in Rome to oversee critical matters. Other key events, including preparations for the 2025 Holy Year, are proceeding as planned, with Archbishop Rino Fisichella recently leading a Mass in St. Peter’s Basilica in place of the ailing pontiff.Unlike the clear guidelines for a pope’s resignation or death, no formal rules exist if a pontiff becomes permanently incapacitated. Canon law has provisions for bishops in such situations, but not for the pope, leading to a significant grey area. In 2021, canon lawyers proposed norms for such an event, suggesting that if a pope were to become totally unable to govern, the College of Cardinals could assume temporary control. However, these proposals have not been formally adopted.Francis has previously disclosed that he wrote a letter of resignation shortly after his election, to be used in case of medical incapacity. The letter is believed to be in the hands of Vatican officials, though its conditions and validity remain unclear. According to church law, a resignation must be “freely and properly manifested,” raising questions about whether an already incapacitated pope could formally step down.As Pope Francis battles serious illness, speculation grows over the Vatican’s next steps. While he remains in charge for now, the possibility of resignation looms larger than ever. The situation has also prompted fresh discussions on the need for clearer succession procedures in cases of papal incapacity. For the world’s 1.4 billion Catholics, the coming days will be crucial in determining not only Francis’s future but also the stability of the Church’s leadership.",Pope Francis remains in a critical condition at Rome's Gemelli Hospital.

Vice president JD Vance is a clear favorite to become President Donald Trump 's successor in the 2028 presidential election though Trump dropped enough hints that he wants to run again and for that, he's ready to change the Constitution. Recently, Trump said 'no' when he was asked whether he sees Vance as his successor. He also said that it was too early though Vance is very capable.But GOP activists clearly like JD Vance as he was the choice of 61 per cent of CPAC attendees.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio and incoming UN ambassador Elise Stefanik both had 3% support.The results revealed that Trump has an unprecedented 99 per cent approval rating among the group.Donald Trump Jr., Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and Vivek Ramaswamy, who is expected to launch a gubernatorial bid in Ohio next week, all got two percent support.Arkansas Gov. Sarah Sanders (R), Florida Sen. Rick Scott (R ), Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Trump’s former GOP presidential primary rival Nikki Haley all received one per cent support. Four per cent said they were undecided.CPAC’s straw poll was conducted by Republican pollster Jim McLaughlin.A further 99% of participants said they agreed with the statement “The first few weeks of Donald Trump’s presidency have been the best for the modern conservative movement in my lifetime” — with 94% saying they “strongly agreed.”The poll this year delved into knotty constitutional issues as well. In a question which admitted that Congress has the constitutional power to set funding levels for federal agencies, the poll asked whether Trump and the Department of Government Efficiency should be allowed to have control over these levels instead. A full 89% of CPAC attendees said Trump and DOGE should be in charge of funding issues — with just 5% siding with Congress.",JD Vance was the choice of 61 per cent of CPAC attendees.

NEW DELHI: The US President Donald Trump has once again raised concerns over alleged USAID's $18 million funding allocation for elections in India, questioning the rationale behind spending substantial amounts abroad instead of focusing on American voter participation.Speaking at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), Trump suggested reverting to paper ballots and proposed seeking India's assistance with electoral processes.""18 million dollars for helping India with its elections. Why the hell? Why don't we just go to old paper ballots, and let them help us with their elections, right? Voter ID. Wouldn't that be nice? We're giving money to India for elections.

AI server facility in Texas

Apple's Quarter Performance

Aligned with tariff strategy to boost US Economy

Apple has announced that it will invest $500 billion in the United States over the next four years. The investment will include a massive AI server factory in Texas and the creation of approximately 20,000 research and development jobs across the country.This $500 billion in expected spending will encompass everything from US supplier purchases to the filming of television shows and movies for Apple TV+, news agency Reuters reported.The company did not specify how much of the figure was already planned for its US supply base, which includes partners like Corning, which manufactures glass for iPhones in Kentucky.Apple CEO Tim Cook confirmed that this plan is part of the company's commitment to support American innovation, advanced manufacturing, and high tech job creation.“As a proud American company, we're thrilled to continue to make significant investments in the US. Today, we’re announcing a $500 billion commitment to support American innovation, advanced manufacturing, and high tech job creation.” Tim Cook posted on X.The announcement follows media reports that Apple CEO Tim Cook met with President Donald Trump last week.Trump, who has pushed US companies to shift manufacturing home, claimed that his administration was to thank for the investment.""The reason, faith in what we are doing, without which, they wouldn't be investing ten cents. Thank you Tim Cook and Apple!!!"" Trump wrote in capital letters on his Truth Social platform.Many of Apple’s products, which are assembled in China, may face 10% tariffs imposed earlier this month, though Apple secured some tariff exemptions during Trump’s first term.""This pledge represents a political gesture towards the Trump administration,"" said Gil Luria told Reuters, analyst at D.A. Davidson, adding that the $500 billion is likely to cover all of Apple's US expenditures, including general and administrative costs. It remains unclear whether this marks an acceleration in Apple's spending plans.Apple made a similar announcement in 2018, pledging $350 billion in US investments over five years during Trump’s first term.Following the latest news, Apple's shares were down 0.8% in pre-market trading, according to Reuters. Although most Apple products are assembled outside the US many of its components, such as chips from Broadcom SkyWorks Solutions, and Qorvo are made domestically.Apple also revealed it has begun mass production of its own-designed chips at an Arizona facility owned by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. The move is part of Apple's continued investment in US manufacturing , which aligns with the CHIPS Act, a key industrial policy introduced during Trump's first term.In addition to the AI server facility in Texas, Apple plans to collaborate with Foxconn to build a 250,000-square-foot plant in Houston. This facility will assemble servers for Apple Intelligence, its suite of AI-powered features. These servers are currently manufactured outside the US, according to Reuters.The company also announced plans to expand its Advanced Manufacturing Fund from $5 billion to $10 billion, with a multibillion-dollar commitment to producing advanced silicon at TSMC's Arizona plant.Apple will also establish a manufacturing academy in Michigan to offer free courses in project management and process optimization for small and mid-sized manufacturing firms.In January, Apple CEO Tim Cook celebrated the company's ""best quarter ever,"" with quarterly profits reaching $36.3 billion. The Americas continued to be Apple's largest market, generating $56.2 billion in revenue, while Europe showed strong growth with $33.9 billion in earnings, according to AFP.Apple aims to attract customers with its latest iPhone models powered by new AI capabilities. This move aligns with other tech giants, such as Google, Microsoft, and Amazon, which are increasing investments in generative AI, seeing it as the next frontier of computing.Apple's announcement follows comments from President Donald Trump, who praised Apple's plans to invest ""hundreds of billions of dollars"" in the US as evidence of his tariff strategy's success in boosting the American economy. Trump's administration has used tariffs as a trade weapon, imposing 10% levies on Chinese goods and threatening tariffs on products like semiconductors, cars, and pharmaceuticals. While the administration argues these tariffs encourage US manufacturing, critics warn they could raise consumer prices.","Apple will invest $500 billion in the United States over the next four years.

US President Donald Trump hinted towards a “possible” trade deal with one of its key targets for tariff policies, China.Trump told the Air Force One reporters that during his first tenure in 2020, the country had already agreed on what he described as ""a great trade deal with China.""Beijing also urged Washington to handle trade disputes with ""mutual respect,"" with the Chinese foreign ministry responding on Thursday that both sides should resolve their concerns through ""dialogue and consultation based on equality and mutual respect.""Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun warned that "" trade and tariff wars have no winners and only serve to damage the interests of people all over the world.""One month since he assumed office, Trump has doubled down on tariffs, targeting not just China but also key trading partners like Canada, Mexico, and the European Union. Earlier this month, he imposed an additional 10 per cent duty on all Chinese imports and is now considering further levies, including a potential 25 per cent tariff on lumber.Meanwhile, China has also hit back with retaliatory tariffs, slapping 15 per cent duties on US coal and liquefied natural gas, and 10 per cent on oil, agricultural machinery, and vehicles. China's commerce ministry urged Washington to refrain from using tariffs as a ""tool for coercion.""However, experts warned that in such a trade war, it is usually the US which has to bear the cost of tariffs.The US President said, “there's a little bit of competitiveness, but the relationship I have with President Xi (Jinping) is, I would say, a great one,"" He further revealed that Xi, along with the leaders of France and Britain, could soon visit Washington for talks.Trump's aggressive tariff strategy has sent shockwaves across global markets. Japan, which has a major auto industry stake in the US, has formally requested relief from the 25 per cent steel and aluminium tariffs set to take effect on 12 March. Japanese trade minister Yoji Muto is expected to visit Washington to call for an exemption, according to Japanese media reports.In Europe, the EU has warned of a firm response if Washington imposes tariffs on its goods.European Commission vice president Maros Sefcovic dismissed Trump’s claims of unfair trade ties, calling US-EU relations a ""win-win partnership."" However, he also signalled the Union’s willingness to negotiate, suggesting potential reductions or eliminations of tariffs on industrial products, including automobiles.Within the EU, Germany remains the biggest trade surplus holder with the US, largely due to its thriving automobile and chemical industries, according to Eurostat.Trump’s tariff push is part of his broader plans to reduce the US trade deficit. In 2024, the country’s largest trade surplus stood at $295.4 billion with China, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis.However, economic experts warn that tariffs often result in higher costs for American consumers rather than punishing foreign exporters.As the standoff continues, markets remain on edge, with global leaders bracing for what could be a turbulent period in international trade.","US President Donald Trump hinted towards a “possible” trade deal with one of its key targets for tariff policies, China.

Kentucky leaders criticise the decision

KFC’s legacy

KFC , the fast-food giant originally known as Kentucky Fried Chicken, is relocating its corporate headquarters from Louisville, Kentucky, to Plano, Texas, reports BBC news.Parent company Yum! Brands announced the move, which will require around 100 corporate employees and 90 remote workers to relocate in the coming months.The decision is part of Yum! Brands' broader restructuring, aiming to create two main headquarters for its key restaurant chains. KFC and Pizza Hut will now operate from Plano, while Taco Bell and Habit Burger & Grill will remain based in Irvine, California.Texas has become a popular destination for corporate relocations, attracting companies like Tesla, Oracle, and Chevron due to its lack of corporate and personal income taxes. Kentucky, in contrast, imposes a 5% corporate tax, which some analysts believe may have influenced Yum’s decision.“These changes position us for sustainable growth and will help us better serve our customers, employees, franchisees, and shareholders,” said Yum! Brands CEO David Gibbs. He also emphasised that the move would strengthen collaboration and company culture.Kentucky governor Andy Beshear expressed disappointment over the relocation, saying, “I believe the company’s founder would be, too. This company’s name starts with Kentucky, and it has marketed our state’s heritage and culture in the sale of its product.”Louisville mayor Craig Greenberg shared similar sentiments, calling KFC “synonymous with Kentucky.”Despite the headquarters shift, Yum! Brands has pledged to maintain a corporate presence in Louisville. The KFC Foundation, which supports employee education, will remain in the city. Additionally, the company is providing a $1 million endowment to the University of Louisville’s College of Business for scholarships.Yum! Brands also hinted at plans to establish a flagship KFC restaurant in Louisville as a nod to its historic roots.KFC’s origins date back to the 1930s, when Colonel Harland Sanders started selling fried chicken at a service station in Corbin, Kentucky. The brand expanded rapidly, with the first franchise opening in Salt Lake City, Utah, in 1952. By 1991, the company rebranded as KFC to move away from associations with unhealthy fried food.Today, KFC operates more than 30,000 restaurants across 145 countries, with Colonel Sanders’ image still an iconic part of its branding.Yum! Brands, which spun off from PepsiCo in 1997 and later merged with Tricon Global Restaurants in 2002, has seen strong financial performance this year. Shares have risen over 10%, driven by successful earnings from Taco Bell and KFC’s international locations.","KFC and Pizza Hut will now operate from Plano, while Taco Bell and Habit Burger & Grill will remain based in Irvine, California.

"Porsche loses 'premium' tag in China, thanks to 'smarter' tech at budget price",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/porsche-loses-premium-tag-in-china-thanks-to-smarter-tech-at-budget-price/articleshow/118342225.cms,"BERLIN: After decades of dominating China's market for high-performance cars with precision engineering, German automakers are losing out to Chinese rivals that have shifted the definition of a high-end car to one that is electric, smart and affordable.Many new Chinese vehicles resemble their German rivals, including the popular Xiaomi SU7, which mimics Porsche's Taycan. The SU7 rivals the Taycan in power and braking, but also includes integrated artificial intelligence that can, for instance, help with parking and greet drivers with their favorite song. The cherry on top: It sells for roughly half the price of a Taycan. As a result, German automakers that for decades commanded China's premium car market are now seeing their sales dwindle, while Xiaomi - a leading Chinese smartphone manufacturer - last year sold more than 100,000 models of the SU7.Among the hardest hit has been Porsche, which reported last month that its deliveries in China plunged 28% in 2024. Although Porsche's sales were up in every other region around the world, the decline in China was significant enough to pull down its global deliveries for the year by 3%.For years, German automakers relied on the Chinese market to make up for weaker demand elsewhere, leading them to ignore deeper problems at home. Chief among them was a reluctance to adopt technology that has come to define driving in China: electric vehicles equipped with sophisticated software and, increasingly, artificial intelligence.Market experts said advances in software and features such as automated driving and remote control had become standard in Chinese electric cars , pressuring European automakers used to cashing in on their brand names to step up their game. ""I think Chinese consumers right now are ready to accept that Chinese companies can produce cars that are considered as premium to them,"" said an economist.This month, Porsche said it would part ways with its finance chief and a top sales executive, both of whom had come under pressure for poor performance, including in China. Last week, Porsche said it would cut up to 1,900 jobs in Germany over the coming years. The SU7 is not yet available for export, but a few models have reached the US. Ford Motor CEO James D Farley Jr. said he had one shipped to Chicagoand ""didn't want to give it up"".Xiaomi has also been testing pared-down versions of its SU7 Ultra, which will be released in China in March, on Germany's storied racetrack, the Nurburgring. In Oct, the car set a record for the ""fastest four-door sedan,"" and industry media and car fans cheered the news, excited that the SU7 had beaten Porsche's Taycan by 20 seconds. Racetrack officials, however, said the times were not comparable because the Chinese car was a preliminary version competing in an essentially open category, while the Taycan was a showroom-ready model and ran in a highly regulated category. Regardless, the message was unmistakable. nyt","Many new Chinese vehicles resemble their German rivals, including the popular Xiaomi SU7, which mimics Porsche's Taycan.

NEW DELHI: Amid Donald Trump's moves to redefine global trade rules, the resumption of negotiations for India's free trade deals with the UK and the European Union later this month are seen as indications that India as well as its two trading partners are willing to moving ahead with the much-delayed agreements in a bid to overcome the impact of protectionist American policies.Almost a year after negotiations had come to a halt, British minister of state for trade policy Douglas Alexander is scheduled to be in the Capital next week to restart the dialogue after elections in both countries.Towards the month-end, a team from EU will arrive, following signs of a broad agreement on the direction of talks after commerce secretary Sunil Barthwal and commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal held separate talks with their counterparts in Brussels, clearly articulating the need to recognise India's development status and sensitivities. Besides, India wants EU to budget for non-tariff barriers and not just focus the talks on duty cuts.The conclusion of the two deals can help India increase trade with these two crucial trade partners, although the talks with the EU are unlikely to be finalised in a jiffy, given the large membership of the trading bloc as well as the difficult ask in several areas.The eagerness to move is visible on the Indian side too, which has dropped its resistance in some of the crucial areas. For instance, in the Budget, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman agreed to revisit the model bilateral investment treaty , a major demand from the UK and EU.Similarly, by cutting the levy on bourbon whiskey and some varieties of wine as well as bikes over the last fortnight, govt has signalled its willingness to other trade partners that it can lower duties in case it gets something in return. The latest duty cut on bourbon has also resulted in demands from the local industry to ensure that doors also open for Indian goods in overseas markets.""Govt needs to safeguard the interests of Indian liquor manufacturers while deciding on issues related to customs duty cuts (basic customs duty and agriculture cess) and other concessions under FTAs. Though we have already recommended to govt to cut basic customs duty on spirits over a period of 10 years, we also want govt to ensure better international market access, especially the western countries, and safeguard interests of Indian companies against any dumping of products,"" said Anant S Iyer, director general of the Confederation of Indian Alcoholic Beverage Companies, which represents domestic manufacturers.","The resumption of negotiations for India's free trade deals with the UK and the European Union later this month are seen as indications that India is willing to move ahead.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor ( CEA ) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

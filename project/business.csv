(AI image)

Stock market today : BSE Sensex and Nifty50, the Indian equity benchmark indices, closed in red on Wednesday taking cues from global markets . While BSE Sensex went below 73,700 intraday, Nifty50 dipped to near 22,350 levels. BSE Sensex ended the day at 73,847.15, down 380 points or 0.51%. Nifty50 closed at 22,399.15, down 137 points or 0.61%.Donald Trump's statements on impending 'major tariffs' for pharmaceuticals and the 104% tariffs on China have added to the gloom in global markets, which in turn is reflecting in the Indian markets. However, in some relief for the market the RBI has cut the repo rate by 25 basis points to 6% and changed its stance to 'accommodative' from 'neutral'.The top BSE Sensex gainers were Nestle India, HUL, Titan Company, Power Grid and UltraTech Cement. The top losers were State Bank of India, L&T, Tech Mahindra, Tata Steel and Sun Pharma.Ajit Mishra – SVP, Research, Religare Broking said, “Markets slipped after a brief rebound, losing over half a percent as the choppy trend persisted. Sentiment took a hit following the announcement of fresh U.S. tariffs on China, leading to a gap-down opening and a largely range-bound session thereafter. The outcome of the MPC meeting—where a 25-bps rate cut was announced along with a shift to an accommodative stance—failed to evoke any meaningful market reaction. As a result, the Nifty index closed at 22,399.15, down 0.59%. On the sectoral front, most indices ended in the red, with IT, pharma, and realty emerging as the top losers. The broader market also faced pressure, with losses ranging from 0.60% to 1%. The ongoing volatility continues to keep traders cautious, and any near-term relief seems unlikely given the recent tariff-related developments and the onset of the earnings season. Investors will react to the IT major, TCS’s results in early trades on Friday, which could influence market direction initially. Until volatility, as reflected by the elevated India VIX, cools off, we recommend maintaining a hedged approach to navigate potential sharp swings.""Asian and European markets saw significant declines on Wednesday, with Japan's Nikkei 225 falling by more than 5 per cent following the implementation of new US tariffs, including a substantial 104 per cent duty on Chinese imports.The Nikkei 225 decreased by 3.9 per cent to 31,714.03. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong dropped 0.4 per cent to 20,041.03, whilst the Shanghai Composite index recovered from early losses to advance 0.9 per cent to 3,173.56.Taiwan's market performance was the weakest in Asia, with its Taiex index declining by 5.8 per cent.The Chinese government announced its intention to implement ""resolute measures"" to protect its trading interests, although specific countermeasures were not disclosed.European markets also witnessed substantial losses. Germany's DAX fell 2.1 per cent to 19,857.36, whilst France's CAC 40 decreased 2.1 per cent to 6,949.92. The UK's FTSE 100 declined 2 per cent to 7,753.42.Financial markets are likely to experience continued volatility due to uncertainty regarding the duration of Trump's substantial import tariffs, which are expected to increase prices for US consumers and decelerate economic growth.","BSE Sensex and Nifty50, the Indian equity benchmark indices, closed in red on Wednesday taking cues from global markets.

The relief rally followed a historic upswing on Wall Street, where major indices recorded some of their biggest gains in recent years.""I have authorised a 90 day PAUSE,"" Trump said, recognising around 75 countries that have been in talks with US over tariff and have not retaliated yet.Trump's message on Truth Social declared a 90-day pause on new tariffs for most US trading partners, replacing them with a 10 per cent Reciprocal Tariff . However, China was excluded from this relief — with tariffs on Chinese goods hiked to 125 per cent.In a series of posts, Trump encouraged Americans to stay calm and invest. ""BE COOL!"" and ""THIS IS A GREAT TIME TO BUY!!!"" he wrote, adding that fears over the economy had been overblown.On Wednesday, US markets posted stunning gains.The rally began after Trump's tariff announcement hit social media.Japan on Thursday welcomed Trump's decision to pause reciprocal tariffs, calling it a positive step, but reiterated calls for Washington to reconsider other trade measures that continue to impact key Japanese industries.""We received the latest US announcement positively,"" chief government spokesman Yoshimasa Hayashi said, adding, ""We continue to strongly demand that the United States reviews measures on its reciprocal tariffs, tariffs on steel and aluminium, and tariffs on vehicles and auto parts.""Leading the Asian rally, Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 skyrocketed 8.8 per cent to 34,510.86, gaining more than 2,000 points almost immediately after trading began. Within 15 minutes, it was already up 7.4 per cent, reflecting investor relief.Australia's S&P/ASX 200 index surged 6.3 per cent in early trade, reflecting the positive global sentiment following the tariff reprieve.

The jump comes after the US announced it would delay the imposition of a planned 36 per cent tariff on goods from Thailand, easing fears among investors about a potential hit to exports and economic growth.Reacting to global volatility, France lowered its 2025 GDP forecast from 0.9 per cent to 0.7 per cent. Economy minister Eric Lombard said further revisions would depend on how trade negotiations unfold with the US.Back home, Indian markets on Wednesday bucked the global trend. The Sensex slipped 379.93 points to close at 73,847.15, while the Nifty dropped 136.70 points to end at 22,399.15.The losses came despite the Reserve Bank of India cutting rates to cushion the economy from tariff-related pressures.","Asian markets surged on Thursday morning after US President Donald Trump paused most of his planned tariffs.

In draft guidelines released on April 3, the central bank proposed a uniform cap on the loan-to-value ( LTV ) ratio for gold loans, limiting it to 75% of the collateral's worth. For NBFCs, this ceiling will apply uniformly, regardless of whether the loan is for consumption or other purposes. During Covid , RBI had relaxed norms and allowed up to 90% loan-to-value ratio for a year.RBI also called for greater internal accountability among lenders. Banks and NBFCs will be required to set their own LTV limits based on internal risk assessments. A standardised framework for valuing gold collateral is to be introduced, with lenders required to disclose the reference price and adopt a uniform method for assessing purity, as well as calculating gross and net weights. This valuation process must be applied consistently across branches and disclosed on the lender's website.""With a view to harmonising such regulations across regulated entities while keeping in view their risk-taking capabilities, and also to address a few concerns that have been observed, it has been decided to issue comprehensive regulations, on prudential norms and conduct related aspects, for such loans,"" RBI governor Sanjay Malhotra said.

"Trump’s trade war pivot: Relief for most, wrath for China",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/trumps-trade-war-pivot-relief-for-most-wrath-for-china/articleshow/120144911.cms,"AI image of Xi Jinping and Donald Trump

Why Trump hiked tariffs on China

Trump’s decision to isolate China for special punishment wasn’t economic alone — it was deeply personal and strategic.

“They were very disrespectful. They didn’t respond right. They retaliated,” Trump said, referencing China’s new 84% tariffs on US goods.

Trump has long viewed China as the central villain in his economic narrative — accusing Beijing of dumping cheap goods, manipulating currency, and stealing US intellectual property.

He’s also repeatedly claimed that Chinese leaders don’t understand how to negotiate with him, even as talks between Washington and Beijing have stalled for months.

“China wants to make a deal,” Trump said. “They just don’t know quite how to go about it.”

His aides say the 125% tariff is meant to squeeze Beijing into coming to the table — but also to protect American manufacturing from what Trump calls “flooding the world with junk.”

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said China was “getting aggressive” while the rest of the world was “coming to us.”

“You tried to say that the rest of the world would be moved closer to China,” she told reporters, “when in fact, we’ve seen the opposite effect.”

Trump PAUSES Tariffs; But BOMBS China | American Markets On Fire After U.S. Action

Why it matters

Trump’s sudden pivot narrows what had looked like a global trade war into a more focused confrontation with China. It also showcased his willingness to use economic shockwaves as a negotiation tool — and walk them back just as fast.

By shielding most countries from harsher tariffs — at least temporarily — Trump is isolating Beijing while attempting to rally allies. But the escalation with China opens a new chapter in an already brutal trade war between the world’s two largest economies.

Trump denied that he backtracked on tariffs, saying, “You have to be flexible,” while describing a jittery financial environment.

“People were jumping a little bit out of line, they were getting yippy, a little bit afraid,” Trump said — using a sports term for nerves.

Between the lines

Trump is sharpening his second-term economic agenda: One part protectionist populism, one part shock-and-awe diplomacy. This tariff saga shows how the president blends hardline stances with last-minute recalibrations when the economic pain gets too real.

His administration argues that the tariff threats have drawn world powers to the negotiating table — including countries once considered hostile to his trade approach.

“The entire world is calling the United States of America, not China, because they need our markets,” said White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt.

The decision to pause tariffs wasn’t made in a vacuum. Trump admitted watching “the very tricky” US bond market and saw yields rising as stocks tumbled — a warning sign that rattled both investors and the White House.

Behind the scenes, aides insisted this was part of a broader Trump strategy. Treasury secretary Scott Bessent framed it as deliberate brinkmanship: “This was his strategy all along,” Bessent said, suggesting that Trump had “goaded China into a bad position.”

But the president himself contradicted that clean narrative, admitting he’d been reconsidering his tariffs due to recent market moves — and warning, “Nothing’s over yet.” “A lot of times, it’s not a negotiation until it is,” Trump said.

China Launches FIERY ATTACK On Trump, Declares 'WAR' In Response To Tariff Ultimatum | Watch

In an unexpected move, US President Donald Trump pleasantly surprised global markets on Wednesday with a major reversal on his tariff policy — announcing a 90-day pause on increased duties for most countries while unleashing a steep new 125% tariff on imports from China.The about-face capped a wild week of financial turmoil and geopolitical uncertainty following Trump’s ""Liberation Day"" announcement of sweeping global tariffs. The new move — revealed via his Truth Social account — triggered a euphoric rally on Wall Street and major stock exchanges across Asia.“I have authorized a 90 day PAUSE,” Trump posted, crediting the decision to over 75 countries reaching out for trade talks and, crucially, refraining from retaliation.The S&P 500 surged 9.5%—its third-best day since 1940 — and the Dow Jones rocketed nearly 3,000 points, helping to reverse a weeklong slide triggered by Trump's initial tariff escalation.But while most of the world exhaled, Trump made clear that China would not get a reprieve — only more pressure.Markets rejoiced, especially after days of sharp losses:Asia followed suit, with Japan’s Nikkei 225 leaping more than 2,000 points at open, up 8.8%. South Korea’s Kospi and Australia’s S&P/ASX also posted large gains. Even China’s Shanghai Composite saw modest gains — a sign traders hope the worst might be over.Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management described the market reaction as a shift “from fear to euphoria.”But not all were convinced the volatility is behind us. “Markets more broadly... are looking for signs that a trade de-escalation is coming,” said TD Securities’ Gennadiy Goldberg. “Absent any de-escalation, it’s going to be difficult for markets to stabilize.”The next 90 days will be a whirlwind of behind-the-scenes negotiations. Bessent confirmed the US will pursue ""bespoke"" deals — case-by-case arrangements that could touch on trade, security, and even foreign aid.""The only certainty we can provide is that the US is going to negotiate in good faith,"" Bessent said, suggesting talks with Japan, South Korea, India, and Vietnam are already underway.But China remains on a separate track — or perhaps no track at all.Trump appears intent on cornering Xi Jinping’s government, betting they’ll be forced to cave under pressure. China responded Thursday with 84% tariffs on US goods and sharp warnings:“If the US insists on further escalating its economic and trade restrictions, China has the firm will and abundant means to take necessary countermeasures and fight to the end,” the commerce ministry said.Tourism warnings followed, and US officials worry China could respond with more economic weapons — including squeezing access to rare earth metals or targeting American tech firms operating in China.Trump’s fixation on China reflects his long-standing grudge against Beijing, accusing it of ""dumping"" cheap goods and gutting US manufacturing. His strategy—easing pressure on allies while doubling down on Xi Jinping’s regime—aims to isolate China economically, though analysts like Daniel Russel of the Asia Society Policy Institute doubt Beijing will blink. ""China sees concessions as weakness,"" he said.(With inputs from agencies)","Trump is sharpening his second-term economic agenda: One part protectionist populism, one part shock-and-awe diplomacy.

Lego opened a $1 billion factory in Vietnam , marking a major step in the Danish toymaker ’s bid to strengthen its presence across Asia. The new plant is located in the southern province of Binh Duong, is the company’s second facility in Asia and its sixth globally.The factory is designed to cater exclusively to the growing demand in Asian markets, with products destined for customers in countries such as Australia, Japan, South Korea, India, and Vietnam itself. It will not export to the United States, where a steep 46 per cent tariff on Vietnamese goods has discouraged many international firms from shipping there.The company plans to employ more than 4,000 people at the site.Lego’s CEO, Niels Christiansen , said the move was driven by both strategic and practical factors.He said that it was important “to have proximity to some of the countries where we have a lot of revenue and a lot of Lego fans.""""It was also important that we can have very high skilled labour and the level in Vietnam is strong,"" he told news agency AFP.The company is aiming to have the factory fully powered by renewable energy by 2026, as a part of the toymaker’s quest to stop adding greenhouse gases by 2050.

So far, Washington has shown no sign of backing down.“The EU considers US tariffs unjustified and damaging,” the Commission added, warning that continued escalation could harm both economies and the global trade system.","The EU has announced a new wave of retaliatory tariffs on the United States.

Beijing fired back swiftly, arguing the tariffs were based on an outdated understanding of trade imbalances. A white paper released by the Chinese Ministry of Commerce emphasized that once services and corporate operations are included, US-China trade is “roughly in balance.”China said it ran a $26.57 billion trade-in-services deficit with the US in 2023, mainly from industries like finance, insurance, and professional services.The commerce ministry also accused Washington of failing to honor the Phase 1 trade deal signed during Trump’s first term. The US law requiring TikTok’s parent company ByteDance to divest the app or face a ban was cited as an example of ""coercion"" and ""forced technology transfer.""“History and facts have proven that the United States’ increase in tariffs will not solve its own problems,” the white paper noted, warning the move would raise US inflation, disrupt global supply chains, and risk pushing the US economy toward recession.While several countries have sought negotiations with the White House , China has stayed firm. “If the US truly wants to resolve issues through dialogue and negotiation, it should adopt an attitude of equality, respect, and mutual benefit,” said foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jian .","Beijing announced a sweeping hike in tariffs on American goods, raising rates from 34% to 84%.

From book to blueprint

More than a decade after economist and senior counsellor to President Trump, Peter Navarro , warned about China’s growing power in his book Death by China, his once-controversial views are now shaping US policyThis week, the US announced a massive 104% tariff on Chinese goods — a clear sign that Navarro’s tough stance on China has gone mainstream. The new tariffs mark another sharp rise in tensions between the world’s two largest economies, continuing a trade war that has been building for years.At the heart of Death by China lies a simple thesis: Beijing is not merely a competitor on the global stage — it is a threat. Navarro , along with co-author Greg Autry, argued that China engages in unfair trade practices, from intellectual property theft and currency manipulation to dangerous product dumping and abusive labour standards. The book’s subtitle — Confronting the Dragon: A Call to Action for the Western World — left little doubt about its sense of urgency.Navarro claimed that every dollar Americans spent on Chinese goods was a dollar that supported an authoritarian regime that crushed dissent, exploited workers, and posed a strategic threat to democratic nations. “We are buying the rope that will be used to hang us,” he warned in one passage. The metaphor was vivid, the politics confrontational, and the implications global.Peter Navarro’s appointment to Trump’s economic team marked a dramatic shift in Washington’s stance towards China. For decades, US policy was guided by the assumption that integrating China into the global economy — especially through the World Trade Organization — would lead to political liberalisation and economic balance. Navarro’s views turned that logic on its head.Under Trump, Navarro helped craft a barrage of tariffs targeting hundreds of billions of dollars’ worth of Chinese imports. Beginning in 2018, the US imposed waves of levies on Chinese goods, citing the need to correct a massive trade imbalance and to respond to alleged Chinese economic aggression. China retaliated in kind, leading to a protracted trade war that rattled global markets.While critics warned of rising prices for American consumers and disruptions to global supply chains, Navarro remained undeterred. For him, the short-term pain was necessary. “We cannot be afraid of economic discomfort if it means defending our industrial base and national sovereignty,” he said during a White House press conference in 2019.This week’s announcement by the Trump administration to impose a 104% tariff on Chinese EVs was ostensibly about protecting American industry from predatory pricing. US officials argue that Chinese automakers, backed by generous state subsidies, are flooding the market with low-cost vehicles in a bid to dominate the future of transportation.The scale and specificity of the measure, however, closely echo Navarro’s worldview. In Death by China, the authors warned of a future where advanced industries — like renewable energy and high-tech manufacturing — would be captured by China, leaving the West both economically dependent and strategically vulnerable.“First it was steel, then electronics, and now it’s green technology. Each time we cede an industry to China, we lose jobs, we lose leverage, and we lose our future,” Navarro wrote in a follow-up publication, The Coming China Wars.Navarro’s hawkishness has not gone unchallenged. Economists across the ideological spectrum have criticised his embrace of protectionism, calling it both economically unsound and geopolitically risky. Nobel laureate Paul Krugmanonce referred to Death by China as “a dangerous piece of nationalist economic propaganda.”The International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank have warned that escalating tariffs — such as the 104% hike on EVs — could fuel inflation, disrupt green energy transitions, and entrench global divisions. China has already hinted at retaliation, possibly targeting American agricultural exports or tech firms operating in mainland markets.Even some US manufacturers have expressed concern. While shielding domestic EV makers may offer temporary breathing space, they warn that it could delay innovation and invite countermeasures that hurt other sectors of the economy.Navarro’s ideas are no longer confined to the United States. The European Union is currently investigating Chinese EV subsidies, while countries like India, Japan, and Australia are also reassessing their trade exposure to China.In early 2025, the European Commission released a white paper citing “strategic economic overdependence on authoritarian regimes” — language that mirrors Navarro’s tone and arguments. Germany, once a bastion of free trade with China, is now reevaluating its auto-sector partnerships.Navarro’s core claim — that free trade with China is not “free” at all, but heavily distorted by state influence — has become a mainstream concern in capitals around the world.While the Trump administration has not openly credited Navarro for the recent tariff measures, the continuity in China policy is hard to miss. From export controls on advanced semiconductors to the 104% tariff on EVs, the core logic of economic decoupling persists.Navarro, for his part, sees this as validation. In recent interviews, he has praised the Trump White House for “waking up to the China threat,” even if the pace and scope of action don’t match what he would prefer.“The dragon doesn’t sleep. It only waits,” he recently said during a conservative conference. “And if we don’t confront it economically now, we’ll face it militarily later.”Death by China may have started as a fringe manifesto, but its ideas have profoundly reshaped global trade debates. Peter Navarro, often ridiculed for his unorthodox views, became the architect of a trade doctrine that is now being sustained and expanded by his ideological opponents.The 104% tariff on Chinese EVs is not just a policy — it is a symbol. It reflects the West’s deepening mistrust of China, the growing appeal of economic nationalism, and the enduring legacy of a man who wrote that “appeasement through trade is the road to ruin.”As the world enters an era of technological competition, climate urgency, and geopolitical realignment, Navarro’s warning may no longer be seen as alarmist — but prescient.","White House trade adviser Peter Navarro warned about China's growing power in his book Death by China.

'US begs for eggs': Chinese netizens mock Trump’s 104% tariffs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-begs-for-eggs-chinese-netizens-mock-trumps-104-tariffs/articleshow/120116001.cms,"Beijing’s measured fury, online bluster



As US President Donald Trump’s 104% tariffs on Chinese imports came into force early Wednesday, the fallout was immediate—not just in markets, but across Chinese social media, where satire, nationalism, and fury collided in real time.On platforms like Weibo, the country’s Twitter-like microblogging site, users responded to the tariff escalation with a mix of ridicule and resolve. As per a Guarding report, top-trending hashtags included “The US begs for eggs while fighting the trade war” and “Trade barriers can’t stop economic globalisation.” The tone was scathing, sarcastic, and unmistakably defiant.“If you can’t even handle an egg, why are you fighting a trade war,” one user posted, referencing the recent egg shortages in the US that have become unexpected fodder in this high-stakes geopolitical standoff. Others shared viral photos of empty supermarket shelves in American cities. In response, influential Chinese bloggers floated the idea of restricting US poultry and egg imports as retaliation—aiming directly at American farmers, one of Trump’s core political constituencies.The tariffs, which Trump doubled from 54% to 104% in a matter of days, represent one of the most aggressive trade actions taken by a US president in the modern era. China’s response has been equally fierce, slapping a 34% levy on American goods and vowing further retaliation. But beyond the boardrooms and diplomatic meetings, the war is playing out vividly online—where China's digital citizens have turned economic confrontation into a cultural event.Weibo users also took aim at Apple, predicting price hikes on iPhones and vowing to switch to Chinese-made alternatives. “If an iPhone costs double, I’ll happily go back to Huawei,” one user declared. Xiaomi and Huawei, seen as patriotic alternatives, trended briefly as Chinese shoppers imagined a world where American tech is priced out of reach.The online commentary took a more political turn when a controversial post circulated describing Trump’s strategy as shrewd and suggesting that China should capitulate. Attributed to an unnamed Chinese money manager, the post urged exporting nations to bow to “the world’s largest economy.” Though the author denied writing it, the backlash was swift and ferocious.“China is the world’s largest producer of industrial products and won’t be controlled by buyers,” prominent commentator Kai Lei, who has 2.5 million followers, wrote in a rebuttal. The original post, and screenshots of it, were quickly censored—a reminder that while Chinese social media often feels chaotic and boisterous, the government still maintains a firm grip on what can be said, and by whom, a Bloomberg report said.While China’s online space hummed with satire, the real economy was reeling. Trump’s tariff campaign—rolled out first as a 10% baseline on most imports last weekend, then targeted at perceived “bad actors”—has thrown global markets into turmoil.The S&P 500 has shed nearly $6 trillion in value since the measures were announced, marking the steepest four-day decline since the index’s postwar creation. US stock futures point to a fifth straight day of losses. Asian markets were also hammered Wednesday: Japan’s Nikkei fell more than 3%, and the South Korean won touched a 16-year low.In public statements, Beijing has maintained a tone of firm opposition without theatrical language. China’s Commerce Ministry called the tariff hike “blackmail” and pledged to defend the country’s interests. But on Weibo, users were more than happy to supply the drama.Some called for a complete boycott of American goods. Others cheered potential restrictions on Hollywood films and luxury items. A few nationalistic influencers even suggested retaliatory action against US firms operating in China, echoing past online flareups against brands like Nike and H&M.The flare-up comes as Trump’s administration attempts to thread a complicated needle: raising pressure on China while signaling openness to deals with other partners. Talks with Japan, South Korea, and Italy are already scheduled. Trump has floated new tariffs on pharmaceuticals and called the current ones “permanent,” even as he insists they are a negotiating tool.“We have a lot of countries coming in that want to make deals,” he said at a White House event Tuesday.For now, no direct dialogue with China is scheduled. And in the absence of official diplomacy, China’s online sphere has become a proxy battlefield—one where memes, emojis, and national pride are the dominant weapons.(With inputs from agencies)","US President Donald Trump’s 104% tariffs on Chinese imports came into force early Wednesday.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume.

Startups will play important role in helping India become 3rd largest economy: CEA Nageswaran,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/startups-will-play-important-role-in-helping-india-become-3rd-largest-economy-cea-nageswaran/articleshow/105332523.cms,"Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor ( CEA ) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran Udaan until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.Udaan built an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business still accounts for a very small part of India’s overall retail market but can balloon to $150 billion in sales and yield a 100% return on capital invested in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co. estimates published in the Mint newspaper.Bengaluru-based Udaan has also ventured into financing through its fintech unit which helps shopkeepers get working capital loans to buy inventory. That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says.

How India's GDP has been growing

What SBI report said on savings and investment

Incremental capital output ratio

NEW DELHI: India's gross domestic product (GDP) data for the third quarter (October-December 2022) received a word of caution from the former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan In an interview with news agency PTI, Rajan that India is ""dangerously close"" to the Hindu rate of growth in view of subdued private sector investment, high interest rates and slowing global growth.India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying"".However, a report released by the State Bank of India (SBI) economists on Tuesday dismissed arguments that India is dangerously close to Hindu rate of growth saying such statements are ""ill-conceived, biased and premature"".The term 'Hindu growth rate' was coined by late economist Raj Krishna in 1978 to describe the slow growth in the country.It basically refers to the low pace of economic growth rates during 1950s to 1980s. During this period, the Indian economy averaged 3.5%.A former lecturer at the Delhi School of Economics (DSE), Krishna noted that only if the rate of growth is persistently slow and accompanied by low per-capita GDP, then it will be known as Hindu rate of growth but it has to factor in population growth as well.Before economic reforms of 1991, India's economic growth remained stagnant and low, while per capita income averaged around 1.3%. Krishna termed this low growth situation to be a result of socialist policies of state control and import substitution.However, the economic situation changed when liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation (LPG) reforms came into effect in the year 1991, at a time when India faced balance of payment crisis.Over the years, many economists have strongly opposed the idea of 'Hindu growth rate' and the term never had universal acceptance.The Indian economy plunged into its very first technical recession in FY21 due to the impact of Covid-19 pandemic and the related nationwide lockdowns. GDP shrunk by an unprecedented 23.8% in the first quarter of the financial year 2020-21. However, due to spurt in economic activities in the subsequent quarters, the GDP decline started to narrow.However, if we look at the period before Covid-19 as well, India's growth curve shows a declining trend.From 8.26% in FY17, GDP growth plunged to 3.74% in FY20. Shutdown of economic activities in FY21 in wake of Covid-19 only made matters worse.As lockdowns started to ease and business activities resumed, India's GDP also started rising. In Q1 of FY22, growth jumped to 20.1% mainly on account of low base effect. By the fourth quarter of FY22, growth came down to 4.10%.Similarly, the new financial year 2022-23 brought fresh economic challenges in the form of Russia-Ukraine war that impacted almost all major economies of the world, slowed the pace of growth, pushed inflation to record highs.As a result, the central banks of all advanced economies spurred into action and opted for monetary policy tightening to curb the soaring inflation.With persistently rising interest rates, India's economy grew by 4.4% in Q3 of FY23, as the Centre revised upwards GDP growth for previous year to 9.10% from 8.7% earlier.The report weighed recent GDP numbers against the available data on savings and investments for the past decade and highlighted some interesting points.""Quarterly growth numbers are noisy and should be best avoided for any serious interpretation (on an average, India's GDP growth has witnessed Rs 2 lakh crore upward revision for the 3 year ended FY23),"" the report said.Gross capital formation (GCF) by the government touched a high of 11.8% in 2021-22, up from 10.7% in 2020-21.""This also had a domino effect on private sector investment that jumped from 10 per cent to 10.8% over the same period,"" it said.In fact, Ecowrap added that the trends in GCF to gross output ratio or the plough back of funds for creation of fresh capacity shows that for public administration the ratio attained fresh peak in 2021-22 owing to the emphasis on capital expenditure in recent budgets.At the aggregate level, gross capital formation is supposed to have crossed 32% in 2022-23, the highest level since 2018-19.According to the report, in 2021-22, gross savings have risen to 30% from 29% in 2020-21.""The ratio is supposed to have crossed 31 per cent in 2022-23, the highest since 2018-19. The household savings increased sharply during the pandemic period on account of sharp accretion in financial savings such as deposits,"" said the report by SBI's Economic Research Department.While household financial savings have since then moderated from 15.4% in 2020-21 to 11.1% in 2022-23, savings in physical assets have grown sharply to 11.8% in 2021-22 from 10.7% in 2020-21.The report further analysed Incremental Capital Output ratio (ICOR) -- which measures additional units of capital (investment) needed to produce additional units of output. It said that the ratio has been improving.""ICOR which was 7.5 in FY 12 is now only 3.5 in FY22. Clearly, only half of capital is now needed for next unit of output,"" the report noted.Such reducing ICOR in the current years reflects a relatively increasing efficiency of capital and shows that the economy is on a sound footing, the report said.""From that point of view, future GDP growth rates even at 7% could still mean a decent number by any standards!,"" it added.","India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.

An employee is entitled for a 50 per cent amount of the last drawn salary as pension.OPS was discontinued by the NDA government in 2003 with effect from April 1, 2004.Under the new pension scheme (NPS), employees contribute 10 per cent of their basic salary towards pension while the government contributes 14 per cent.Governments of Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand have informed the central government/ Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority ( PFRDA about their decision to restart OPS for their employees.The government of Punjab on November 18, 2022, issued a notification regarding implementation of OPS for the state government employees who are being covered under NPS. Jharkhand too has decided to revert to OPS.",Former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan has expressed his concern over the decision of some states to restart the old pension scheme.

SEBI Unveils ‘Valid’ UPI System to Protect Investors from Fraud in Capital Markets Starting Oct 1

UPI New Rules 2025: Top Things to Know

Cap on balance enquiries to prevent system overload

Limit on bank account access via “list account” API

Restrictions on UPI autopay transactions during peak hours

Industry reaction welcomes move towards efficiency

Deadline set for compliance; penalties for violations

Starting August 1, 2025, UPI will see changes as the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has rolled out new performance-centric guidelines for the UPI ecosystem.The changes are aimed at improving system efficiency, preventing outages, and ensuring better user consent mechanisms.Payment Service Providers (PSPs), UPI apps, and banks must implement the changes by July 31, as per NPCI’s compliance notice dated May 21.A major change includes a cap on balance enquiry requests, now limited to 50 per app per customer in a rolling 24-hour period, as per ET.These requests must be user-initiated only, with no automatic prompts by apps or systems. UPI apps must also introduce the ability to reduce or halt such requests during peak load hours to minimise system strain.The guidelines also require issuer banks to include the available account balance in every successful UPI transaction message, streamlining user experience and reducing the need for separate balance checks.NPCI has also put in place access limits on the “list account” API, which lets users view bank accounts linked to their mobile number. This API will now be restricted to 25 requests per customer per app per day, and only after the user selects their bank in the app.Any retries must be made with explicit customer consent, ensuring transparency and avoiding unnecessary API calls.To further address system congestion, NPCI has restricted UPI Autopay executions to non-peak hours only. Peak hours are defined as 10:00 to 13:00 and 17:00 to 21:30.Each autopay mandate will be allowed one initial attempt and a maximum of three retries, clearly capped at four total executions per mandate sequence.Welcoming the new rules, Tarun Nazare, co-founder and managing director of Neokred was quoted as saying by ET that “These measures are prudent and forward-thinking, as they prioritise system efficiency and user security. By capping balance requests and optimising API usage—especially with clear restrictions during peak hours—the guidelines will effectively reduce server overloads and potential service outages. ”He also highlighted the value of “emphasis on customer consent and timely compliance” in enhancing system accountability.The NPCI has clearly warned that failure to comply with these directives by July 31, 2025, may result in UPI API restrictions, penalties, suspension of new customer onboarding, or any other appropriate action.NPCI has advised all member banks and UPI ecosystem participants to communicate these changes across their systems and partners ahead of the compliance deadline.","The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has rolled out new performance-centric guidelines for the UPI ecosystem. Changes are aimed at improving system efficiency, preventing outages, and ensuring better user consent mechanisms.

Gold price prediction today: Gold rates continue to hover in a range as news on Donald Trump’s trade policies flows in. Where are gold prices headed and what should investors do?Gold futures remain under pressure as the MCX Gold October Futures contract struggles to recover from recent declines. After a brief pullback from the intraday lows, prices are currently hovering around ₹98,778, with key technical indicators pointing to a weak rebound lacking bullish momentum. In light of the current setup, traders are advised to adopt a Sell on Rise strategy near ₹99,000, with a stop-loss at ₹99,450.The 8-period EMA is at ₹98,765, and the 21-period EMA is at ₹98,800. Price is trying to reclaim these levels but is struggling to close decisively above either, indicating hesitation and overhead resistance. A failure to sustain above ₹99,000 would confirm bearish control.A clear lower-high lower-low formation dominates the 15-minute chart. The attempt to bounce back from the ₹98,600–₹98,700 zone is facing headwinds from the declining short-term moving averages. Selling interest is visible on every upward tick.Despite a modest bounce, volume remains uneven and not supportive of a bullish reversal. Open interest trends also suggest caution, with no aggressive long buildup detected.This favors the view of a corrective pullback rather than a trend change.The previous day’s pivot and price action suggest that the ₹99,000–₹99,200 range remains a critical resistance zone. The multiple failed attempts to hold above this level make it an ideal sell zone for intraday setups.• The RSI is approaching the 50–52 zone but has not broken above convincingly, implying weak upside momentum.• While the MACD is not visible in the chart, the price structure suggests a shallow or weak crossover at best, lacking strength to confirm bullish continuation.Given the confluence of resistance around ₹99,000, lack of follow-through volume, and weak momentum, traders may consider a Sell on Rise strategy in the range of ₹99,000–₹99,100, maintaining a stop-loss at ₹99,450. Downside targets include ₹98,550, followed by ₹98,200 if selling intensifies. Until the price decisively breaks and sustains above the 21 EMA with supportive volume, the trend remains vulnerable to further declines.","Gold futures remain under pressure as the MCX Gold October Futures contract struggles to recover from recent declines.

However, sources said New Delhi would not compromise on issues related to agricultural, dairy, or genetically modified (GM) products.

Stock market recommendations:Benchmark indices remain highly volatile amid escalating trade tensions between India and the United States. The heightened uncertainty is primarily driven by ongoing developments surrounding potential tariff measures. In a recent statement, US President Donald Trump suggested the imposition of a 25% tariff on Indian exports, a move that has raised concerns across markets.This proposed tariff hike has triggered anxiety among investors, who fear the repercussions it could have on bilateral trade relations and the broader economic outlook. As a result, key stock indices are experiencing sharp fluctuations, reflecting the market's sensitivity to geopolitical and trade-related developments. Market participants are closely monitoring official responses and further policy announcements from both nations to gauge the potential impact on corporate earnings and economic growth.Going ahead, index to consolidate in the range of 24,500-25,000 in the coming sessions.While a move above 25,000 levels will open further upside towards the key resistance area of 25,250, being the almost identical high of the last 2 weeks.Volatility is anticipated to remain elevated in the coming session, driven by key macro triggers including the US- India tariff decision and the RBI rate decision.On the downside, the 24,600–24,400 zone emerges as a critical demand area, marking a confluence of key technical levels — the prior swing low, the 100-day exponential moving average, and the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement of the recent up move from 23,935 to 25,669.Bank Nifty on Thursday session rebounded from the key support area of 55,500-55,000 levels being the confluence of the 100-day EMA and key Fibonacci retracement levels of the prior up moveSince April, intermediate corrections have remained shallow while the index has consistently held above its 100-day EMA.Structurally, the index is undergoing a time-wise correction rather than a steep price correction, which is a constructive sign in the context of a prevailing uptrend. The formation of higher base patterns near the key moving average support zone, along with subdued retracements, implies that stronger hands are utilizing dips to accumulate.Going ahead we expect the index to hold above the support area of 55,500-55,000 levels and head higher towards 57,500 and 58,300 levels in the coming weeks.Buy in the range of Rs 1050-1070The stock after the recent corrective decline is forming base around the 61.8% retracement of the previous up move (933-1238). The stock provides favorable risk reward set up for the next leg of the up moveThe stock has already taken 14 weeks to retrace just 61.8% of its preceding 13 weeks up move (933-1238). A shallow retracement signals a positive price structure. The weekly stochastic has approached an extreme oversold territory with a reading of 08, hence a technical pullback is likely in the coming weeks.We expect the stock to head higher towards 1175 levels being the 61.8% retracement of the 1247-1055.The stock has generated a breakout above a falling channel containing last one month’s corrective decline with a bullish gap up action signaling resumption of up move.The stock is currently trading above its short- and long-term moving averages thus validating positive bias from a medium-term perspective.We expect stocks to maintain positive bias and head towards an all time high of 3963 in the coming months, being the measuring implication of the range consolidation.","According to Bajaj Broking Research, Axis Bank, and Larsen and Toubro are the top stock picks for today.

Wider EBITDA margins are expected to offset the effects of high capital expenditure, it added.On the impact of the 25% US tariffs recently announced by President Donald Trump—along with a penalty targeting Indian trade ties with Russia—Fitch said the direct impact on rated Indian corporates would likely remain limited, owing to low-to-moderate exposure to US exports.However, the report cautioned about potential “second-order risks” arising from global excess supply. Fitch also noted that an eventual India-US trade agreement may alter outcomes, and companies are likely to explore export diversification to mitigate the tariff shock.India and the US are in the midst of negotiations for a bilateral trade deal. According to reports, New Delhi has taken a firm stance against Washington’s demand for duty concessions on agriculture and dairy products—sectors where India has traditionally offered no preferential tariffs in any FTA.Fitch said that sectors focused on the domestic market—such as upstream and downstream oil & gas, cement and building materials, telecom, utilities, and engineering and construction—should see minimal tariff-related disruptions due to strong local demand and regulatory insulation.In contrast, Fitch highlighted that tariff uncertainty may dampen discretionary exports in IT services and automotive components to the US and Europe during FY26. Pharmaceuticals could also be vulnerable to policy changes from the US side.Additionally, the report said that steel and chemicals may face pricing pressure from oversupplied global markets, while the metals and mining sector could experience higher price volatility due to emerging global growth risks.","Fitch Ratings has revised India’s GDP growth projection for the current financial year down to 6.3%, from its earlier estimate of 6.4%.

He reaffirmed the resilience of the Indian economy, saying that the country must remain vigilant about its economic interests and adopt ‘swadeshi' products.""There is an atmosphere of global instability. All countries are focusing on their individual interests. India is going to become the third biggest economy in the world and this is why India will have to stay alert as far as its economic interests are concerned,"" the PM said, two days after UP President Donald Trump called India a 'dead economy'. CM Yogi Adityanath and two deputy CMs, Keshav Maurya and Brajesh Pathak were present on the occasion.Addressing a public gathering at Kalikadham in Sevapuri after transferring Rs 20,500 crore directly into the bank accounts of over 9.70 crore farmers as the 20th installment of the PM-Kisan Samman Nidhi scheme and inaugurating and laying the foundation of 52 projects worth around Rs 2,200 crore, the PM urged people to go ‘Vocal for Local'.""Anyone who wishes good for the country and wants to see India become the third-largest economy must encourage this spirit of going local,"" he said.The PM urged traders to promote ‘swadeshi' products, terming it a true national service, and appealed to citizens to use Indian-made goods during the upcoming festivals and wedding seasons.He also advised people to hold weddings in India instead of abroad, highlighting that many young people were already doing so. ""Every choice we make in favour of ‘Swadeshi' will shape the future of the country. With everyone's effort, the dream of a developed India will come true. From now on, let's pledge to buy and decorate our homes with only Indian-made products,"" he added.Modi highlighted his government's farmer-centric policies, stating that unlike previous governments, the BJP administration has fulfilled its promises to farmers, citing the PM-KISAN Samman Nidhi as a prime example. ""When this scheme was launched, opposition parties like the Samajwadi Party and Congress left no stone unturned to mislead farmers by claiming that after the 2019 Lok Sabha election, it would be stopped and even the money transferred into the accounts of farmers would be taken back. However, Rs 3.75 lakh crore has been transferred directly to farmers' accounts so far,"" he said.In UP alone, 2.5 crore farmers have received over Rs 90,000 crore, while farmers from Kashi got Rs 900 crore, he added.Referring to the transparency maintained in the schemes of his govt, Modi said, ""There are no cuts, commissions, or middlemen. We created a permanent system where there's no leakage and no one can steal the rights of the poor.""Prime Minister Modi emphasized developing the most backward regions with his mantra of 'High priority to more backward'. He highlighted the newly approved PM Dhan Dhanya Agriculture Scheme, focusing on underdeveloped districts with low crop production and income.He said the govt will invest Rs 24,000 crore in this scheme to support farmers from ‘lab to field' and ‘seed to market' for their products. Massive investments are being made in irrigation, and under the PM Fasal Bima Yojana, over Rs 1.75 lakh crore in claims were already paid out to farmers.Modi also mentioned a record increase in the MSP for farmers. Emphasising the govt's focus on boosting women's participation in agriculture through initiatives like Lakhpati Didi and Drone Didi, he stated that the aim is to empower 3 crore rural women financially, with over 1.5 crore already becoming Lakhpati Didis. Taking a subtle dig at the opposition, the PM said: ""Hearing these numbers, SP leaders might just hop on their cycles and run away. ""Despite agriculture being a state subject, the Centre has taken proactive steps to enhance farmers' income and living standards by implementing beneficial schemes, PM Modi said.He praised banks for launching a mega campaign and holding fairs in villages across the country for KYC renewal of the account holders under the Jan-Dhan scheme on the completion of its 10 years of launching.Modi also marked the distribution of assistive devices under the Rashtriya Vayoshri Yojana to 2,000 Divyangs by handing over devices, including low vision glasses to Babli Kumari (visually impaired student), sports wheelchairs to Santosh Kumar Pandey and Vikas Kumar Patel, hearing aids to Kishun, and a motorized tricycle to Sita Kumari Pal (teacher).Union agriculture minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan joined the event virtually from Patna.","Prime Minister Narendra Modi sent a strong message to the world that protecting India's economic interest was paramount.

Steep tariffs for those resisting Trump's demands

Legal battle escalates as costs rise for US consumers

Winners still end up paying more

US President Donald Trump's sweeping new tariff regime, set to take effect August 7, has triggered a wave of economic disruption across the globe, from low-income nations like Laos and Algeria to wealthy trade partners such as Canada and Switzerland.Under the new policy, countries face steep new import duties unless they agree to revised trade terms with the US. Trump has framed the plan as a campaign for ""fairness"" under the slogan of ""Liberation Day,"" invoking a 1977 law to declare the trade deficit a national emergency and bypass Congress. But legal and economic blowback is mounting, with US courts weighing challenges and allies questioning Washington's reliability, AP reported.""In many respects, everybody's a loser here,"" said Barry Appleton, co-director of the Center for International Law at New York Law School. ""The U.S. consumer's a big loser,"" added Alan Wolff, a former WTO deputy director-general and trade official.Even countries that struck deals to reduce their tariff exposure are still facing steeper import duties than before. The UK agreed to raise tariffs on its exports to the US from 1.3% to 10%, despite the US running a trade surplus with it for nearly two decades.The EU and Japan accepted 15% tariffs, lower than the threatened rates but still significantly higher than last year's levels.Nations that refused to negotiate fared far worse. Laos and Algeria, despite low per capita incomes, now face tariffs of 40% and 30% respectively. Brazil was slapped with a 50% levy, reportedly over its treatment of former president Jair Bolsonaro. Canada drew a 35% tariff, tied in part to its position on Palestinian statehood.Even Switzerland, which did not reach an agreement, was hit with a 39% import tax, exceeding the originally announced 31%.""The Swiss probably wish that they had camped in Washington to make a deal,"" said Wolff, now a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.Five US businesses and 12 states have filed lawsuits against the new tariffs, arguing that Trump overstepped his authority. In May, the US Court of International Trade sided with plaintiffs, blocking the tariffs, though collections continue during the appeal process.Economists at Goldman Sachs estimate that US businesses and consumers are absorbing most of the cost. Companies including Walmart, Nike, Best Buy and Procter & Gamble have all raised prices in response.""This is a consumption tax, so it disproportionately affects those with lower incomes,"" said Appleton. ""Your appliances are going to go up. Your TV and electronics are going to go up. Your video game devices, consoles are going to go up.""According to Yale University's Budget Lab, the average US tariff has jumped from 2.5% at the start of 2025 to 18.3%, the highest since 1934. The lab estimates this will cost the average US household $2,400 annually.Even countries that reached deals to avoid Trump's harshest penalties are still absorbing high tariffs. Taiwan saw its rate lowered from 32% to 20%, and Angola's from 32% to 15% — but both were paying less than 2% before the new policy.Lesotho, one of the poorest nations affected, saw its tariff reduced from 50% to 15%, though economists say the damage may already be done.""He [Trump] wants to do it because he found an undervalued franchise -- not because the market says you need to do a deal,"" said Wolff, referring to Trump's transactional approach to global trade.","US President Donald Trump's sweeping new tariff regime, set to take effect August 7, has triggered a wave of economic disruption across the globe.

India has significantly ramped up its crude oil imports from the United States during President Donald Trump’s second term, marking a major shift in its energy sourcing strategy, according to official trade data, reported ANI- quoting sources.Imports of US crude rose over 50 per cent in the first half of 2025 compared to the same period last year. From January to June 25, India imported an average of 0.271 million barrels per day (mb/d), up from 0.18 mb/d during the same timeframe in 2024.The uptick has been especially sharp in recent months. Imports during the April-June 2025 quarter soared 114 per cent year-on-year, with the value rising from $1.73 billion in Q1 of FY24-25 to $3.7 billion in Q1 of FY25-26.“So, in July 2025, India imported 23 per cent more crude oil from the US compared to June 2025. In India's overall crude imports, while the US share was only 3 per cent, it increased to 8 per cent in July. Furthermore, in the financial year (2025-2026), Indian companies would increase their crude oil import by 150 per cent,” the ANI sources said.The energy trade expansion is not limited to crude. Imports of liquefied natural gas (LNG) from the US nearly doubled — rising from $1.41 billion in FY2023-24 to $2.46 billion in FY2024-25.Liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) imports have also grown significantly. Negotiations are reportedly underway for a multi-billion dollar long-term LNG supply agreement.The growth in bilateral energy trade comes amid continued affirmations of strong diplomatic ties between the two nations. Ministry of External Affairs on Friday, reiterated its confidence in the strength of the Indo-US partnership. “India and the United States share a comprehensive global strategic partnership anchored in shared interests, democratic values, and robust people-to-people ties. This partnership has weathered several transitions and challenges. We remain focused on the substantive agenda that our two countries have committed to and are confident that the relationship will continue to move forward,” MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said at a scheduled press conference.However, this trade relation faced a setback when Trump announced 25 per cent tariffs on India. He said that India would face a 25 per cent tariff, ""plus a penalty for the above, starting on August 1""; later changed to August 7. The White House justified the move by citing India’s “obnoxious non-monetary trade barriers,” persistent trade imbalances, and strong energy and defence ties with Russia.In another remark posted on Truth Social, Trump said, ""I don’t care what India does with Russia. They can take their dead economies down together, for all I care. We have done very little business with India, their Tariffs are too high, among the highest in the World. Likewise, Russia and the USA do almost no business together. Let’s keep it that way...""Also read: India continuing to buy oil from Russia- Report rebuts Donald Trump's 'good steps' claim","India has significantly ramped up its crude oil imports from the United States during President Donald Trump’s second term.

In a slew of amendments to the Motor Vehicles Act, the ministry has also proposed making uninsured vehicles pay three times the insurance premium for plying on roads and five times the premium for a repeat offence.Further, the ministry has proposed setting timelines for states to adopt guidelines issued by the Centre for registration and regulation of vehicle aggregators, and approve setting up of automated testing stations. It has circulated the proposed amendments to other ministries for their feedback, before it seeks Cabinet approval for the same.Under the current system, while the Centre officially sets maximum speed limits for NHs and expressways, states usually impose lower limits for these highways. This lack of uniformity often leads to drivers being penalised for exceeding limits set by states for NHs and expressways. This has also become a breeding ground for corruption involving law enforcement agencies.For uninsured vehicles, the ministry has proposed a steep hike in penalties. Instead of the current penalty of Rs 2,000 for a first offence and Rs 4,000 for repeat offences with up to three months' imprisonment, the amendment proposes such violators be required to pay three times the base insurance premium for a first offence and five times for repeat violations. The move is aimed at checking the rise in number of vehicles plying without valid insurance and ensuring better compliance.The draft amendments propose stricter norms for renewal of driving licences. A mandatory driving test will be required for those convicted of offences such as overspeeding and drunk driving. Additionally, those above the age of 55 will need to undergo a driving test at time of licence renewal.",The road transport ministry has proposed that the Centre set the speed limits for NHs and expressways while states can do so for state highways and other roads.

ED proof confirms use of fake docus in name of banks

NEW DELHI: In a significant development ahead of questioning Anil Ambani of Reliance ADAG, Enforcement Directorate late on Friday night arrested Partha Biswal, the MD of Biswal Tradelink Pvt Ltd (BTPL) that was searched by the agency in connection with a Rs 68-crore fake bank guarantee provided by the Ambani group to Solar Energy Corporation of India Ltd (SECI) to secure a tender.The central agency has claimed that Anil Ambani ADAG group's Reliance Power Ltd paid Rs 5.4 crore to Biswal's BTPL for ""providing this bank guarantee"" by forging documents.A special court here on Saturday granted the custody of Biswal, whose company was searched on Friday, to ED till Aug 6, during which he is likely to be confronted with Anil Ambani and questioned about the fake bank guarantee he allegedly generated by spoofing email of govt lender SBI.The agency on Friday issued a look out circular (LOC) to put curbs on foreign travel by Anil Ambani who has been summoned for questioning on Aug 5 at the agency's headquarters in Delhi.Biswal's BTPL was incorporated in 2019 and has been found to have at least seven ""undisclosed bank accounts"" involving transactions of alleged proceeds of crime, disproportionate to its declared turnover, has been found during the money trail conducted by ED.On Friday, ED conducted searches at three premises in Bhubaneswar and one at Kolkata after its investigators found alleged evidence of the fake bank guarantee provided to SECI on behalf of Reliance NU BESS Ltd/Maharashtra Energy Generation Ltd.""BTPL fraudulently arranged and submitted fake bank guarantees of Rs 68.2 crore along with forged SBI endorsements and fabricated confirmations for a SECI tender.

The Reliance Group reiterated its statement issued on Friday saying: ""The company and its subsidiaries acted bonafidely and have been a victim of fraud. ..

Speaking at a webinar, Sabnavis argued that India’s non-export-oriented growth model provides resilience amid rising global protectionism.“Since we are not an export-oriented economy, it is becoming advantageous for us because we are more dependent on domestic consumption,” he said, quoted ANI.The comments come days after US President Donald Trump announced a 25% tariff on Indian goods along with an unspecified penalty, despite earlier expectations of a bilateral trade deal. The move is part of Trump’s broader tariff push under his April 2, 2025 executive order, which imposes reciprocal tariffs ranging from 10% to 50% across trade partners.Bank of Baroda has projected GDP growth of 6.4% to 6.6% for FY26, a forecast that already factors in potential export disruptions. According to BoB estimates, a 10% drop in exports would shave about 0.2 percentage points off GDP.India’s exports account for 21% of GDP, with services contributing nearly half of that — a composition that makes the country less vulnerable to goods tariffs. “India’s significant reliance on service exports cushions the economy in this volatile tariff environment,” Sabnavis added.BoB expects India’s current account deficit to remain below 1% of GDP despite the tariff shock. While about 10% of the Wholesale Price Index (WPI) basket could see imported inflation, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) is not expected to rise in the near term.Trade data presented during the webinar showed that India’s export exposure to the US is relatively high at 19.8%, while imports from the US account for just 6.3%. Sectors such as electronics, marine products, readymade garments, gems and jewellery, chemicals and poultry are among the most vulnerable.BoB analysts noted that clarity is awaited on potential exemptions, which could mitigate some of the impact. “Some industries may face higher input costs, which could impact profit margins,” the bank said in its presentation.","Bank of Baroda has projected GDP growth of 6.4% to 6.6% for FY26.

The modest growth followed a 6.6% rise in total income and a 3.9% increase in net interest income, as the drop in lending rates outpaced the decline in cost of funds, leading to narrower margins.Finance costs rose 6.3% to Rs 5,047.3 crore. There was also a drag on profitability from higher provisions and other operating expenses. Impairment on financial instruments jumped 34.8% to Rs 192.9 crore, reflecting a more cautious provisioning approach. Other expenses increased 29.6% to Rs 90 crore, while spending on employee benefits and depreciation grew 5.6% and 10.5%, respectively.Total disbursements stood at Rs 13,116 crore in Q1 FY26, compared with Rs 12,915 crore in the corresponding period of FY25, up 2%. Of this, disbursements in the individual home loan segment were Rs 11,247 crore, compared with Rs 10,932 crore in Q1 FY25, up 3%, whereas project loans were Rs 156 crore compared with Rs 521 crore in Q1 FY25.“We were expecting a surge in demand following the 100 basis points cut in repo rate by the Reserve Bank of India. Unfortunately, that did not happen. The only logical explanation I can give is that people are feeling that we are in the middle of the rate cycle and are waiting for the rates to bottom out,” said Tribhuwan Adhikari, managing director and chief executive officer of LIC Housing Finance. He added that the company aimed to increase the share of its individual home loans but would not go very aggressive on rates.On the income side, fees and commission revenue fell 21.8%, adding further pressure on the bottom line.Asset quality improved compared to the corresponding quarter last year. Gross and net NPAs declined, while the provision coverage ratio increased, indicating a strengthened balance sheet.

Net profit declined 14.6% to Rs 861.8 crore in the quarter ended June 30, 2025, from Rs 1,009.5 crore a year earlier.The fall in profit was driven by a 177.4% surge in provisions and contingencies, excluding tax, which rose to Rs 400.2 crore from Rs 144.3 crore in the year-ago quarter. The rise in provisioning, largely linked to the agri and microfinance portfolios, weighed on earnings despite stronger performance in the bank’s core lending operations.“We have had a strong quarter in terms of operational performance,” said managing director and CEO KVS Manian. “Besides the provisions for agri and microfinance sector, there has been no impact on asset quality. In the MFI segment, we have seen the peak of the slippage and expect that it will bottom out this quarter.” Manian also said that expectations on further rate cuts by the RBI were divided, and that any reduction would affect earnings.Operating profit rose 3.7% to Rs 1,556.3 crore from Rs 1,500.9 crore in the same quarter last year, backed by growth in the bank’s lending business.Net interest income increased 2% to Rs 2,336.8 crore, as interest earned grew 5.6% to Rs 6,686.6 crore, while interest expended rose faster at 7.7% to Rs 4,349.8 crore. The squeeze on spreads limited the pace of growth in core interest income.The bank’s loan book expanded steadily, with net advances rising 9.2% year-on-year to Rs 2,41,204.3 crore.

The capital adequacy ratio under Basel III rose to 16.03% from 15.57%, supported by growth in internal accruals.According to the bank’s unaudited standalone results, provisioning continued to be the main drag on profitability in the June quarter.

EXTENDED INTERVIEW: VP Kamala Harris's ""107 Days"" Is A Peek Behind The Scenes Of The 2024 Election





Former Vice President Kamala Harris made her first public appearance since her defeat to Donald Trump in the 2024 presidential election, joining Stephen Colbert onThe interview came just a day after Harris announced she would not run for California governor in 2026 and as she began promoting her upcoming memoir, 107 Days, which reflects on her short-lived presidential campaign and turbulent final weeks in office.During the conversation, Colbert thanked Harris for fulfilling her constitutional duty by certifying the 2024 election results on January 6, 2025, despite the tense political climate and threats of unrest.Colbert reflected on the timeline and said, “One of the challenges for you, I thought of that last year. Or actually, gosh, it's still this year. One of the things I thought of after the election and before January 20th is that you were still the vice president.”“And you had to be there on January 6th and count out those electoral ballots and certify. First of all, thank you for doing your constitutional duty.”Harris replied, “Without any question.I was fully aware of what that moment required, not just of me, but of our country. I talk about it in the book. That was… it was a difficult day, to be sure.”She recalled the emotional weight of returning to the Capitol, where she had once served as a senator and vice president-elect. “I had been at the Capitol four years before because I was then vice president-elect and a United States senator,” she said.“So what I talk about in the book is that drive to the Capitol and remembering four years before, and what Mike Pence did, and what our Constitution requires, and the importance of fulfilling those responsibilities.”“It was a difficult day because it conjured a lot in terms of what that exact day was, what that day has meant in the history of our country — the recent history of our country,” she added.Colbert then asked if she had ever spoken to former Vice President Mike Pence about his actions on January 6, 2021.“I did not,” Harris responded. “But I've been very happy to compliment him as often as I can for having the courage to do what he did.”Harris further told Stephen Colbert that what surprised her most during Donald Trump’s return to office was the level of surrender within the U.S. political system.“I didn’t predict that; I did not see that coming,” Harris said on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, referring to what she described as widespread “capitulation” to Trump’s agenda, especially among congressional Republicans.Colbert had asked if Harris felt like saying, “I told you so,” considering her past warnings about Trump’s leadership, such as alienating allies and slashing taxes for the wealthy.“I believed that on some level, there should be many who consider themselves to be guardians of our system and our democracy, who just capitulated,” she replied.Without naming names, Harris appeared to target Republicans in Congress for failing to check Trump’s power grabs. “I think there are a lot of people who think they are riding out the storm as an excuse to be feckless,” she said.She criticised Congress, especially House Republicans, for failing to act against moves like Trump’s attempt to dismantle the Department of Education.“Congress has the role and responsibility to stand in the way of that, and they’re just sitting on their hands,” she said, slamming their decision to go on recess amid Democratic calls for transparency on Jeffrey Epstein-related records.Harris, who received a standing ovation from the audience, also discussed her new book, 107 Days, which reflects on her brief 2024 presidential campaign.Her new book, 107 Days, set for release on September 23 by Simon & Schuster, offers a behind-the-scenes account of her brief campaign after Biden withdrew from the race last year.She said her recent decision not to run for California governor or any office for now was a conscious step away from a system she sees as deeply flawed.“I just, for now, I don’t want to go back into the system,” Harris said. “I think it’s broken.”While praising frontline public servants, she expressed disillusionment with institutional politics:“I always believed that as fragile as our democracy is, our systems would be strong enough to defend our most fundamental principles. And I think right now that they’re not as strong as they need to be.”When Colbert pressed on whether she started preparing for a run after President Biden’s poor debate performance in June 2024, Harris said, “I have an incredible amount of respect for him.”“I think that the way that we should be thinking about where we are right now is to remember that we had a president of the United States who believed in the rule of law, who believed in the importance of aspiring to have integrity and to do the work on the behalf of the people, and that’s where I will leave that,” she added.When asked who currently leads the Democratic Party, Harris stumbled. “There’s a lot of leaders,” she said, without naming one.","Former Vice President Kamala Harris made her first public appearance since her defeat to Donald Trump in the 2024 presidential election, joining Stephen Colbert on The Late Show.

NEW DELHI: Another indigenous multi-role stealth frigate, Himgiri, was delivered to the Navy Thursday that will boost country's blue-water combat capabilities. This is the second such stealth warship to be handed over to the force this month.The 6,670-tonne Himgiri has been built by the Kolkata-based Garden Reach Shipbuilders & Engineers (GRSE), while her predecessor Udaygiri was handed over by the Mumbai-based Mazagon Docks (MDL) on July 1. Both the warships are slated to be commissioned together towards end-August.The 149-metre long Himgiri is the third of the seven frigates being constructed under Project-17A, four at MDL in Mumbai and three at GRSE in Kolkata, at an overall cost of Rs 45,000 crore. The first was commissioned as INS Nilgiri in Jan, while the remaining four are to be progressively delivered by end-2026.All these multi-mission frigates are packed with advanced sensors and weapons, including the BrahMos supersonic precision-strike cruise missiles whose range has been extended to 450-km from the original 290-km, and ""designed to address current and future challenges in the maritime domain"", an officer said.For air defence, the frigates are equipped with Israeli-origin Barak-8 surface-to-air missile system, with an interception range of 70km against fighters, helicopters, drones and cruise missiles, among other weapons.""These frigates reflect a quantum leap in naval design, stealth, firepower, automation and survivability, and are an admirable symbol of aatmanirbharta (self-reliance) in warship building,"" the officer said.Overall, the 140-warship Navy has 58 ships and vessels under construction in Indian shipyards for over Rs 1.2 lakh crore, while another 31 warships are in the planning stage.

Indian Footwear Giant Warns of Heavy Blow From Trump’s New Tariffs on Imports

India-US Trade Deal: Why Agri & Dairy Are Sticky Points

US Tariffs on India

The US decision to impose 25% tariffs will have minimal effect on India, sources told PTI. India is clear that duty exemptions for agricultural, dairy and genetically modified (GM) products in trade agreements is a no-go area, the report said, quoting sources.Negotiations between New Delhi and the US regarding the trade deal are ongoing. The US delegation is scheduled to visit India on August 25 for the sixth round of discussions.In the fiscal year 2024-25, trade between India and the US reached $131.8 billion, which includes $86.5 billion in exports and $45.3 billion in imports.A significant portion of Indian exports, including pharmaceutical and electronic items, already fall under the US exemption category and therefore would not incur duties, sources told PTI.""More than half of India's exports to the US (are expected) to remain unimpacted. Due to the Section 232 exemption of the US, only exports worth about $40 billion would be impacted with these tariffs,"" they added.Several sectors would face a 25% duty impact, including electrical and mechanical machinery (approximately $9 billion), gems and jewellery ($12 billion), shrimp ($2.24 billion), textiles/clothing ($10.3 billion), leather and footwear ($1.18 billion), animal products ($2 billion), chemicals (2.34 billion).""More than half of India's exports to the US will not be impacted by the duty. Due to the Section 232 exemption of the US, only exports worth about $48 billion would be impacted with these tariffs,"" they said, adding that the remaining exports will have a little impact on a country with a GDP of about $4 trillion and a consumer base of 140 crore.Officials highlighted concerns regarding the US dairy sector's use of animal feed, noting that India has consistently refrained from offering duty concessions in this sector across all its trade agreements.""There are religious sentiments in the dairy sector. So, it is not acceptable. There will be no compromise on these segments in any of India's trade pacts,"" they said, according to the report.Also Read | Donald Trump tariff impact?

Elon Musk-led Tesla to pay $243 mn in Florida crash case: Jury finds autopilot technology partly at fault; EV maker calls verdict 'wrong',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/elon-musk-led-tesla-to-pay-243-mn-in-florida-crash-case-jury-finds-autopilot-technology-partly-at-fault-ev-maker-calls-verdict-wrong/articleshow/123055130.cms,"Elon Musk-led Tesla to pay $243 mn in Florida crash case

A federal jury in Miami has ruled that Tesla must pay over $200 million in damages after finding its Autopilot driver-assist technology was partly responsible for a fatal 2019 crash that killed 22-year-old Naibel Benavides Leon and severely injured Dillon Angulo in Florida.The jury awarded $200 million in punitive damages and $43 million out of a total $129 million in compensatory damages to be paid by Tesla, concluding that the company’s driver-assist system failed and bore significant responsibility for the crash. This decision makes Tesla liable for nearly two-thirds of the total damages, reported AP.The verdict also comes at a critical time for CEO Elon Musk, who is pushing to expand Tesla’s autonomous vehicle technology and roll out a driverless taxi service in multiple US cities.The incident occurred when George McGee, who was driving a Tesla vehicle, ran through flashing lights, a stop sign, and a T-intersection at 62 mph, crashing into the parked Chevrolet Tahoe.Responding to the ruling, Tesla issued a statement calling the verdict “wrong,” and argued that it undermines the industry's efforts to develop lifesaving technology.“Today’s verdict is wrong,"" and only works to set back automotive safety and jeopardize Tesla’s and the entire industry’s efforts to develop and implement lifesaving technology”.They said the plaintiffs concocted a story ”blaming the car when the driver from day one admitted and accepted responsibility. ”The plaintiffs’ lead attorney Brett Schreiber, conceded that the driver, George McGee, acted negligently by running through flashing lights, a stop sign, and a T-intersection at a speed of 62 miles per hour before crashing into a parked Chevrolet Tahoe.“I trusted the technology too much,” McGee said during his testimony. “I believed that if the car saw something in front of it, it would provide a warning and apply the brakes.”However, Schreiber maintained that Tesla also bore responsibility. He argued that the company enabled dangerous driving behavior by failing to automatically disable Autopilot when drivers became distracted, and by permitting its use on roads like the one McGee was on—routes the system wasn’t intended to operate on.Tesla’s lead defense attorney in the Miami trial, Joel Smith, responded by emphasizing that the company clearly instructs drivers to stay attentive and keep their hands on the wheel. He said McGee ignored those warnings while searching for a dropped cellphone and was speeding, increasing the risk. Smith pointed out that McGee had driven through the same intersection 30 to 40 times without incident, concluding, “The cause is that he dropped his cellphone. ”Jury called out Tesla’s use of the term “Autopilot” as misleading.Brett Schreiber argued that while other automakers use terms like “driver assist” or “copilot,” Tesla’s branding gave consumers a false sense of full autonomy, leading to over-reliance on the system.Lawyers for the family of the deceased also claimed that Tesla either hid or lost key evidence, including data and video recorded seconds before the accident.Financial analyst Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities comments on the verdict, “It's not a good day for Tesla. It's a big number that will send shock waves to others in the industry.”The ruling marks a rare outcome in product liability litigation against Tesla. A car crash lawyer Miguel Custodio, said, “This will open the floodgates.” “It will embolden a lot of people to come to court.” Several similar lawsuits have been filed against the company in recent years, but many have been dismissed or settled before reaching trial.","Jury awards $200 million in punitive damages and $43 million out of a total $129 million in compensatory damages to be paid by Tesla.

"With new 40% tariff on transshipments, Trump takes aim at US dependence on China's factories",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/with-new-40-tariff-on-transshipments-trump-takes-aim-at-us-dependence-on-chinas-factories/articleshow/123052657.cms,"Ever since President Trump began raising tariffs on goods from China during his first term, Chinese companies have raced to set up warehouses and factories in Southeast Asia, Mexico and elsewhere to bypass US tariffs with indirect shipments to the American market via other countries. But on Thursday, Trump took aim at all indirect American imports, which he blames for part of the $1.2 trillion US trade deficit. Trump imposed 40% tariffs on so-called transshipments, which will take effect in a week. And a senior administration official who briefed reporters said work was under way that could broaden considerably the definition of indirect shipments.The new rules cover indirect shipments from anywhere, not just China. But China, with its massive factory infrastructure and expansive manufacturing ambition, has been the main country to develop a global network for such shipments. Trade experts were quick to predict that China would be the most affected - and the most annoyed.Trump's executive order Thursday created a new category of imports: goods that are transshipped through other countries instead of coming straight from the country of origin.The 40% tariffs on these goods will be on top of whatever tariffs would have applied if the goods had come directly from the country where they were originally made.The legal definition of transshipment is narrow: a good that did not undergo a ""substantial transformation"" in the country through which it was indirectly shipped. Countries in Southeast Asia have long denied that they allow a lot of transshipment. They contend that their soaring imports of Chinese components are being assembled into new and different products that can appropriately be labelled made in their countries, and not labelled ""made in China.

"India in, China out: Majority of iPhones sold in the US from India, says Apple CEO Cook",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/india-in-china-out-majority-of-iphones-sold-in-the-us-from-india-says-apple-ceo-cook/articleshow/123047653.cms,"NEW DELHI: Despite US President Donald Trump’s regular rants about Apple’s manufacturing in India, company CEO Tim Cook on Thursday confirmed what is generally now more or less known – the “majority” of iPhones sold in the US in the past quarter were Made in India. China – the erstwhile production giant – is only playing a second fiddle and is used more to service non-US markets.Cook, speaking to analysts post the company’s quarterly results, said India has been the mainstay when it comes to producing iPhones for the US, while Vietnam is the location for making other products for America such as MacBook, iPad, and Watch.“In terms of the country of origin, it's the same as I referenced last quarter. There hasn't been a change to that, which is the vast majority of the iPhone sold in the US or the majority, I should say, have a country of origin of India,” the Apple CEO said when asked about China versus India production plans.On China, Cook had this to say, “… the products for other international countries, the vast majority of them are coming from China.”While the Trump administration imposed 25% tariffs on India earlier this week, smartphones, computers and other electronics devices are exempted from the reciprocal tariffs for now.Trump, however, has been pushing Apple and Cook not to make the iPhones in India for meeting the needs of the US consumers. “I had a little problem with Tim Cook… I said to him, my friend, I am treating you very good… but now I hear you are building all over India. I don’t want you building in India,” he had said during his visit to Doha in May.Cook’s clear stance on India manufacturing, however, is being seen as a signal that the American electronics giant stays bullish on India, especially as the country is also consistent in showing strong growth when it comes to local sales.Cook said that revenues in India are witnessing record growth, led by the growth in sales of iPhones. India is among the high growth markets for Apple which recorded 10% growth globally in its quarterly revenues which closed the quarter at $94 billion.“We saw an acceleration of growth around the world in the vast majority of markets we track, including greater China and many emerging markets, and we had June quarter revenue records in more than two dozen countries and regions, including the US, Canada, Latin America, Western Europe, the Middle East, India, and South Asia. These results were driven by double-digit growth across iPhone, Mac, and services.”The Apple CEO also said the company is in the process of expanding its retail presence in India by opening more stores.On sales, India was again amongst the high-growth countries. “We saw iPhone growth in every geographic segment and double-digit growth in emerging markets including India, the Middle East, South Asia, and Brazil.”And commenting on the global impact of US tariffs across regions (but without identifying any particular country), Cook said the “situation around tariffs is evolving.”“… so let me provide some colour there. For the June quarter, we incurred approximately $800 million of tariff-related costs. For the September quarter, assuming the current global tariff rates, policies, and applications do not change for the balance of the quarter, and no new tariffs are added, we estimate the impact to add about $1.1 billion to our costs. This estimate should not be used to make projections for future quarters, as there are many factors that could change, including tariff rates. ”","Apple CEO Tim Cook confirmed that the “majority” of iPhones sold in the US in the past quarter were Made in India.

The underwhelming numbers came despite Amazon investing $31.4 billion in capital expenditure — outpacing peers — and forecasting full-year spending of $118 billion.As of 11:13 am ET, Amazon shares were trading at $215.95, down 7.76%.“The spotlight was firmly on AWS and it didn’t quite shine as brightly as expected,” said Matt Britzman, senior equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, quoted Reuters. “While Microsoft and Alphabet have already shown strong momentum in cloud growth, AWS wasn’t the knockout many wanted to see.”The market reaction was swift, with Amazon’s stock falling to $216.60 in early trading, wiping out nearly $170 billion in market value.The tech giant's forward price-to-earnings ratio stood at 33.87, slightly behind Microsoft’s 34.19 but well above Alphabet’s 18.64, according to LSEG data.AWS, long seen as Amazon’s profit engine, accounted for about 60% of its operating income but saw its margins shrink to 32.9% — the lowest since Q4 2023. The company’s forecast for total operating income in the current quarter also fell short of market expectations.CEO Andy Jassy said during the earnings call that Amazon was still in the “very early days” of the AI race and that its scale would provide advantages once existing capacity constraints ease.At least 30 analysts raised their price targets for Amazon, while three lowered theirs, giving the stock a median target of $260.Even as AWS drew scrutiny, Amazon’s retail business remained a bright spot. The company reported an 11% jump in online store sales in Q2, beating estimates and showing resilience despite Trump-era tariffs. CEO Jassy said Amazon had not seen a notable rise in consumer prices or demand erosion so far this year.“If Amazon’s retail business was a standalone entity, it would be trading dramatically higher following the near-perfect results,” said Michael Morton, analyst at MoffettNathanson. “Unfortunately, as we all know, the success of the retail business is not what’s going to matter in the near term for Amazon’s stock price.”","Amazon Web Services (AWS) revenue rose 17.5% in the June quarter, narrowly beating Wall Street estimates, but trailing far behind Microsoft Azure’s 39% growth.

From clothing to coffee: Trump escalates tariff war,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/from-clothing-to-coffee-trump-escalates-tariff-war-whats-going-to-get-more-expensive-for-americans/articleshow/123046199.cms,"Clothes, cars and coffee to cost more



The US has slapped tariffs of up to 50% on imports from countries like China, Vietnam and Brazil, directly affecting items like apparel, coffee and vehicles.

BBC reported that clothing prices are expected to surge by up to 37%, according to Yale’s Budget Lab. Department stores such as Walmart and Target have already warned of incoming price hikes.

Coffee from Brazil now carries a 50% tariff, and Vietnamese beans face 20%, meaning daily staples could soon weigh heavier on American wallets.

While tariffs on EU and Japanese cars have been reduced to 15%, imports from the UK still face 10% levies. US-made cars relying on foreign parts are also seeing higher costs, complicating Trump’s aim to boost domestic auto production.

Canada hit hard: food, appliances and retaliation



Tariffs on Canadian exports have risen from 25% to 35%, with Canada retaliating on a wide range of US goods, including ketchup, washing machines and peanut butter, as per BBC.

Canadian grocers like Loblaw have begun labelling about 7,500 items with a “T” to indicate price hikes due to US tariffs.

Canned soups, which rely on US aluminium and steel for packaging, have seen an 8% price increase, while fruit juice prices are up 7.5%.

New and used cars in Canada have also seen price jumps of over 5%, BBC reported, as cross-border auto supply chains are hit with multiple tariffs.

Homes, beer and fuel: A ripple effect



Trump’s levies on steel, aluminium and copper are expected to increase home-building costs. The National Association of Home Builders warned: “Consumers end up paying for the tariffs in the form of higher home prices.”

Trump has floated further tariffs on lumber, impacting US housing even more. Canada supplies 69% of US lumber and is now subject to 35% duties.

Beer prices may rise due to tariffs on Mexican aluminium, affecting canned beer like Modelo and Corona. According to the Beer Institute, 64.1% of beer in the US is canned.

While European energy imports are rising under the new US-EU trade deal, Canada faces a 10% tariff on oil exports to the US. Since Canadian crude powers many US refineries, any disruption could raise fuel prices.

Canada reacts



Loopholes, uncertainty and legal challenges



President Donald Trump has pushed ahead with a sweeping set of new tariffs on imports from dozens of countries, including Canada, China and the European Union, as part of what he calls a mission to “make America GREAT & RICH Again. ” While some nations have negotiated lower rates, others are now bracing for significant increases on key exports. Consumers, meanwhile, are already beginning to feel the effects in their grocery bills, wardrobes, and housing costs.Trump insists the tariffs will bring “billions in revenue” and incentivise domestic manufacturing. But as BBC reports, critics warn that the fallout could spark inflation, worsen trade tensions, and raise prices across several sectors.Canada has sharply criticised President Trump’s decision to raise tariffs on Canadian exports not covered by the Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement (CUSMA) to 35%, calling the move unjustified and harmful to vital sectors of its economy. In a statement, the Canadian government said it remained committed to CUSMA but warned that industries such as lumber, steel, aluminium and automobiles were now “heavily impacted by US duties and tariffs.Ottawa also rejected Washington’s justification linking the tariff hike to the cross-border flow of fentanyl, noting that Canada accounts for just 1% of US fentanyl imports and has significantly stepped up border security. “We will act to protect Canadian jobs, invest in our industrial competitiveness, buy Canadian, and diversify our export markets,” the statement added.According to CNN, Trump’s tariffs will apply from 7 August, but goods already in transit will be exempt if they arrive by 5 October. This loophole, however, is unlikely to ease much pressure due to fixed shipping schedules.Trump has called the tariff process “very well, very smooth,” though negotiations remain incomplete with many nations.Legal challenges are mounting. A US appeals court recently heard arguments questioning whether Trump exceeded his authority by declaring a trade “emergency” to bypass Congress.“The only things we’ll know for sure... are that growth-sapping US import taxes will be historically high and complex,” Scott Lincicome of the Cato Institute told news agency AP.","The US has slapped tariffs of up to 50% on imports from countries like China, Vietnam and Brazil, directly affecting items like apparel, coffee and vehicles.

Revisions also slashed 258,000 jobs from May and June figures, further dampening sentiment.Bond yields fell sharply as expectations of a rate cut by the Federal Reserve surged.

Revenue dropped to $81.51 billion from $93.06 billion, missing analyst projections of $82.82 billion, according to Zacks Investment Research, AP reporyted.Exxon does not adjust its earnings for one-time items, such as asset sales. Still, its reported profit exceeded analysts’ average forecast of $1.49 per share.“We achieved our highest second-quarter Upstream production since the merger of Exxon and Mobil more than 25 years ago,” said Darren Woods, Chairman and CEO of Exxon Mobil. The company reported second-quarter net production of 4.6 million oil-equivalent barrels per day, up by 79,000 barrels compared to the first quarter.Chevron Corp, meanwhile, posted a net income of $2.49 billion, or $1.45 per share. Excluding special items, adjusted earnings came in at $1.77 per share, beating analysts’ estimates of $1.70. Revenue for the quarter stood at $44.82 billion, lower than expectations.The earnings decline marks a significant reversal from the boom period of 2022, when oil and gas companies posted record profits due to high energy prices following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Since then, prices have eased. U.S. benchmark crude has largely traded below $70 per barrel this year and briefly dropped under $60 in May.Chevron said production in the Permian Basin reached 1 million barrels of oil equivalent per day during the quarter. Total US net oil-equivalent production rose by 123,000 barrels per day from the year-ago period.Chevron is also in the process of acquiring Hess Corporation for $53 billion, after securing a crucial legal clearance from a Paris court in July.The global oil market faces fresh uncertainties after eight OPEC+ members announced they would increase output by 548,000 barrels per day in August. The group cited improving global economic conditions and depleted inventories for the decision, which is expected to further pressure crude prices.While oil briefly surged in June during a 12-day conflict between Israel and Iran, it quickly dropped after the US brokered a truce and launched targeted strikes on Iran’s nuclear infrastructure.The combination of geopolitical volatility and OPEC+ actions suggests energy markets could remain under pressure in the near term, despite stronger output by US producers.","Exxon Mobil posted a net profit of $7.08 billion, or $1.64 per share, for the quarter ended June 30.

Donald Trump vs Jerome Powell: US President urges Fed board to overrule Powell on rates; calls him ‘stubborn’ as dissent grows,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/donald-trump-vs-jerome-powell-us-president-urges-fed-board-to-overrule-powell-on-rates-calls-him-stubborn-as-dissent-grows/articleshow/123045446.cms,"Photo credit- AP

US President Donald Trump on Friday called on the Federal Reserve’s board of governors to wrest control of monetary policy from Chair Jerome Powell, escalating his public campaign for deep interest rate cuts and directly attacking Powell as “stubborn. ”In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump said, “If Powell doesn’t ‘substantially’ lower rates, THE BOARD SHOULD ASSUME CONTROL, AND DO WHAT EVERYONE KNOWS HAS TO BE DONE!”The US president, who has nominated several members to the Fed board, has repeatedly criticised Powell for maintaining the central bank’s benchmark rate — currently averaging 4.33% — even as Trump pushes for a 3 percentage point cut to stimulate growth and lower government debt costs. Powell has argued that the Fed must first assess the inflationary impact of Trump’s broad tariff regime before adjusting policy, AP reported.Two Fed governors — Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman — both dissented at the Fed’s meeting on Wednesday, issuing statements that suggested a more dovish stance. They said the recent inflation uptick was likely a one-time effect and the job market showed signs of softening.Trump seized on these internal disagreements.“STRONG DISSENTS ON FED BOARD,” Trump posted. “IT WILL ONLY GET STRONGER!”Despite claiming that the US economy is booming, Trump has repeatedly insisted that inflation is virtually nonexistent — even though the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge is running at an annualised rate of 2.6%, slightly above its 2% target.Friday’s jobs report added fuel to Trump’s demands, showing only 73,000 jobs were created in July. Revisions lowered June and May figures to 19,000 and 14,000 respectively, indicating a sharper-than-expected slowdown.Trump contends aggressive rate cuts would boost growth and help homebuyers and the federal budget. But some economists warn that such steep cuts could release more liquidity than the economy can absorb, risking higher inflation.The dispute has also turned legal. A May ruling by the US Supreme Court indicated that Powell cannot be removed solely for policy differences. However, the Trump administration is reportedly exploring whether Powell can be dismissed “for cause,” citing cost overruns in the Fed’s ongoing $2.5 billion renovation project.Powell’s current term as Fed Chair ends in May 2026.

The US labour market is showing signs of gradual weakening, with job growth slowing even as widespread layoffs and overall unemployment stays low, according to the Assoicated Press report.Recent graduates are among the worst affected. The jobless rate for Americans aged 22–27 with a university degree rose to 5.8 per cent in March—its highest non-pandemic level since 2012—well above the national average. Meanwhile, workers more broadly appear hesitant to switch jobs, with many believing the current market reflects peak employment opportunities.That perception is gaining weight as hiring momentum wanes across most sectors, marking a sharp reversal from the post-pandemic surge when employers wooed talent with signing bonuses, flexible schedules, and even pet insurance.The latest US Labor Department employment report, due Friday (US time), is expected to show a gain of 115,000 new jobs in July, according to a FactSet survey of analysts. Though not weak, this would trail both June’s 147,000 additions and last year’s monthly trend. So far in 2024, the economy has added an average of 130,000 jobs per month- down 23 per cent from 2023 and 68 per cent below the 2021–2023 recovery period.Economists say several forces are driving this cooling: the Federal Reserve’s high interest rates to curb inflation, President Donald Trump’s newly reinstated import tariffs, and fears of declining international labour supply under looming deportation plans.“The labour market is poised for a summer slowdown as businesses put hiring plans on hold but refrain from broad-based layoffs,” Gregory Daco, chief economist at EY-Parthenon, wrote this week, quoted by AP. “We see job growth slowing well below trend in the coming months.”Despite this, job security remains relatively strong. The national unemployment rate stands at 4.1 per cent, while unemployment benefit applications remain in a normal range.But that headline figure masks disparities. “A low unemployment rate and a muted pace of layoffs mask underlying weakness,” said Adam Schickling, senior economist at Vanguard. “The health of the job market can be a matter of perspective. If you're a nurse, prospects are excellent—the unemployment rate for experienced health care practitioners is under 2 per cent. But for young people or older workers re-entering the market, opportunities may appear scarce. ”The voluntary resignation rate—a key sign of worker confidence—has also dropped below pre-pandemic levels.Employment growth is now largely confined to a few sectors. Of the 644,000 private-sector jobs added in 2024, around 405,000- over 63 per cent- have come from healthcare and social assistance alone.Young entrants and returning workers are struggling most amid fewer openings and longer job hunts. The number of discouraged workers—those who have stopped looking because they believe no jobs are available- rose by 256,000 in June to 637,000, according to the Labor Department.“Historically, a drop in hiring has come with a spike in layoffs, a one-two punch that pushes up unemployment,” said Schickling. “Today’s labour market is defying that pattern.”Part of the explanation lies in the shrinking role of manufacturing, where companies once made sweeping headcount cuts. “There’s simply less headcount to cut,” he added.Ultimately, the job market appears to be softening—not collapsing. “Firms are pulling back on hiring without shedding existing workers in significant numbers,” Schickling noted. “The result is a gradual slowdown, not a sharp downturn.”","Recent graduates are among the worst affected.

Pakistan Set To Get US Crude Oil



Pakistan Faces 19% Tariff

Pakistan is set to get its first crude oil shipment from the US later this year after US President Donald Trump announced a trade deal with the country. Trump also said that the US will be helping Pakistan develop ‘massive oil reserves’.The agreement came after several rounds of discussions that commenced in April, following US President Donald Trump's announcement to levy 29% tariffs on Pakistani imports.Cnergyico, Pakistan's biggest refinery, has finalised a deal with Vitol to import 1 million barrels of American oil, according to vice chairman Usama Qureshi's statement to Reuters on Friday. This is Pakistan's first acquisition of US crude oil following a significant trade agreement.Pakistan's largest import commodity is oil, with imports valued at $11.3 billion for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2025, which is approximately one-fifth of the nation's total imports.Also Read | Donald Trump to help Pakistan build ‘massive oil reserves’!

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume.

""We are building at a smaller scale and demonstrating that these can be extremely cost and energy efficient so they can be accessed by everyone.""Large language models, like OpenAI’s GPT-4 and Meta Platforms Inc.’s Llama, are powerful AI systems that understand by learning from vast amounts of diverse data from the internet and elsewhere to summarize, translate, and create text, audio and video for a wide range of applications. The rivalry to develop ever-more sophisticated models is heating up in Silicon Valley and such efforts have attracted billions of dollars in investments.","Sarvam AI is building large language models targeted at unique uses in Indian languages. The Bangalore-based startup, until recently in stealth mode, was co- founded by Vivek Raghavan and Pratyush Kumar. It has ambitious plans to build open source foundational AI systems.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-105804461,imgsize-22527,width-400,resizemode-4/105804461.jpg"

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor ( CEA ) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran Udaan until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.Udaan built an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business still accounts for a very small part of India’s overall retail market but can balloon to $150 billion in sales and yield a 100% return on capital invested in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co. estimates published in the Mint newspaper.Bengaluru-based Udaan has also ventured into financing through its fintech unit which helps shopkeepers get working capital loans to buy inventory. That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says.

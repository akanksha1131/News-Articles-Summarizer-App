Gold price prediction today: Gold rate has been swinging in the last few weeks and has recently pared gains. Global uncertainties make gold a safe haven bet, but the flow of relatively better news internationally, especially on Donald Trump’s tariff front, is taking the sheen off gold. What’s the gold price outlook for this week, and what should investors do?Gold pared some of the gains witnessed last week as the market responded to mounting U.S. fiscal concerns & escalating trade rhetoric from President Trump. This also led to weakness in the dollar as the same stayed below 100, which continued to fuel demand for the yellow metal.Moody’s recent downgrade of U.S. sovereign credit continued to weigh on market sentiment, highlighting the country’s unsustainable debt load. This was compounded by the House’s passage of Trump’s aggressive tax-and-spending package, which the CBO estimated to add nearly $4 trillion to the deficitHowever, gains were quickly unwound at the start of the current week as Trump extended the implementation of a 50 % tariff deadline on goods from the European Union to July providing some relief to equity markets ultimately soothing safe haven flows into gold.Recent signs that the White House may be making nascent progress in negotiations with some trading partners have curbed investor’s desire to hold more of the haven asset such as gold. Physically-backed gold exchange-traded funds have also been in an outflow mode since past five straight weeks after peaking at the highest in more than a year in mid-April indicating gold prices may find some room to consolidate in the short term perspective of 1 - 2 months.For the current week market participants are eyeing Fed meeting minutes & US preliminary GDP estimate for further direction in Gold prices. Any hawkish stance by members in meeting minutes could confirm rate cut delay until September month leading to further profit booking moves in bullion prices in coming days. On the other hand, escalation seen in Russia Ukraine Geopolitics could fuel volatility in prices at lower levels as no signs of truce emerges so far.Gold had shown signs of exhaustion at levels above Rs. 98,000 in MCX futures contract since last week of April. MCX Aug. futures (CMP 95,731 / 10 gm) could turn bearish in case it gives a daily close below 95,400 /10 gm as levels of 93,200 – 92,400 could be witnessed in 1 – 2 weeks perspective.","Maneesh Sharma, AVP - Commodities & Currencies, Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers shares his views and recommendations:Gold Price Outlook: Sideways to Downside Bias.Strategy: Sell on Rise ( duration 1 – 2 Weeks)","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121454055,imgsize-311009,width-400,resizemode-4/121454055.jpg"

The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs on Wednesday approved a higher Minimum Support Price (MSP) for 14 kharif crops. The higher rates are applicable to the marketing season 2025-26.This MSP enhancement for kharif Crops in Marketing Season 2025-26 aligns with the Union Budget 2018-19 declaration, which established MSP at minimum 1.5 times the All-India weighted average production cost.According to the CCEA release, the government has raised the MSP of kharif crops to ensure farmers receive fair compensation for their agricultural produce. Amongst all crops, nigerseed has received the largest absolute MSP increase of Rs 820 per quintal, with ragi, cotton, and sesamum following at Rs 596, Rs 589, and Rs 579 per quintal respectively.The projected returns for farmers beyond their production expenses are calculated to be most substantial for bajra at 63%, whilst maize, tur, and urad are expected to yield 59%, 59%, and 53% respectively. The remaining crops are anticipated to provide farmers with returns of 50% above their production costs.The government has been encouraging farmers to diversify their crop production beyond traditional cereals, focusing on pulses, oilseeds, and Nutri-cereals/Shree Anna by providing enhanced MSP for these alternatives, the release said.The procurement statistics for paddy show an increase, with 7,608 LMT recorded during 2014-15 to 2024-25, compared to 4,590 LMT during 2004-05 to 2013-14.For 14 kharif crops, the procurement volumes rose from 4,679 LMT in 2004-05 to 2013-14 to 7,871 LMT in 2014-15 to 2024-25.The MSP payments to paddy farmers increased, reaching Rs. 14.16 lakh crore in 2014-15 to 2024-25, up from Rs 4.44 lakh Crore in 2004-05 to 2013-14.The total MSP disbursement for farmers growing 14 kharif crops expanded from Rs 4.75 lakh crore in 2004-05 to 2013-14 to Rs 16.35 lakh crores during 2014-15 to 2024-25.","The higher rates are applicable to the marketing season 2025-26.

Top stock market recommendations:For the past 9 trading days, Nifty has been static within a 2% band, however the highs of 25000 has been constantly providing supply non index longs. Unless a closing above 25050 is not confirmed, the downside swing towards 24300 / 24100 remains open on the index. Nifty has had a nearly 15% run up in the past 6 weeks without a 2% correction. With the price action seen from the start of this week, it is fair for the index to retest 200 DMA support on downside which currently reads below 24100.Bank Nifty has broken from its 6 week rising trendline in last week’s trading. This puts the index back on track to retest its polarity support of its original 5 year rising trendline. Targets for this breakdown hint for a 1200-1500 point breakdown from CMP. Negation for this down move is seen only when the index closes above 55600.After a bullish head and shoulder breakout on daily and weekly charts earlier this month, prices are consolidating after crossing the 200 DMA resistance on shares on Chennai Petroleum Corporation. This consolidation in a range is a typical price behaviour on this stock historically observed before another round of up move. A follow up move of 7-9% is likely to be unfolded post this monthly derivative expiry.After trading at a 3 year low in April, LTIMindtree has been rising within a channel and has gained 25% since its April lows. A typical higher high – higher low formation underlines the bullish set up and inflows on the counter. The stock has widely outperformed its benchmark NIFTYIT index on a YTD basis which is down over 13% while LTIM is down 8% in the same period of 2025. A move towards higher range of the bullish channel is likely to unfold for target of 5525.Zydus Lifesciences stock has closed at a 2 month high, after breaking out from a falling trendline earlier this month which was in place since August 2024. Repeated higher lows have been seen from the start of this month on daily charts, this 2 high note closing on charts is likely to allow further thrust on the stock for a resistance meet at its 200 DMA near 980 odd.","According to Aakash K Hindocha, Deputy Vice President - WM Research, Chennai Petroleum Corporation, LTIMindtree, and Zydus Lifesciences are the top buy calls for today.

India's Astounding Growth in Numbers: Top 5 Points

In 2025, India will become the 4th largest economy in the world, in nominal GDP terms, overtaking Japan, and will be behind only the US, China, and Germany.

India’s nominal GDP has more than doubled from 2014 to 2025 (projected). It’s a growth of 105% in just a decade. In 2025, India will also become a $4 trillion economy

India was the 10th largest world economy in 2014 - come 2025 it will be the 4th largest - a six places jump in rankings in just 11 years!

In a world of increasing global economic uncertainties, and amidst geopolitical conflicts and Donald Trump’s tariffs, India will still retain the tag of being the fastest growing major world economy with a GDP growth rate of 6.2% for 2025.

India achieved an average annual growth rate of 6.7% from 1990–2023 & in fact outpaced the US (3.8%), Germany (3.9%), and Japan (2.8%).

What’s worked for India?

The sobering picture

In fact, India doesn’t even rank in top 100 countries when it comes to GDP per capita, not even in the Purchasing Power Parity or PPP rankings.

Road Ahead: More reforms, reforms, reforms

India will become the world’s fourth largest economy by the end of 2025 (FY 2025-26), according to the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ’s) World Economic Outlook report for April 2025. The IMF measures the size of an economy in nominal GDP terms. A few years ago, India overtook the United Kingdom to become the fifth largest, and is now well on its way to rise to the fourth spot in the list of the top 10 largest economies in the world by overtaking Japan.Recently a statement by NITI Aayog CEO BVR Subrahmanyam suggested that India has already become the world's fourth largest economy, however yesterday NITI Aayog member Arvind Virmani clarified that Subrahmanyam was referring to IMF's latest projections and that India is slated to become the 4th largest by the end of this year.To become the world’s fourth largest economy is no mean feat - India has gone from being the 10th largest in 2014 to 4th largest in 11 years under the Modi government. Its Gross Domestic Product or GDP has more than doubled in this time frame. How has the Indian economy achieved this remarkable growth? Why does the per capita GDP number present a sombre picture? And what’s the road ahead for India to become a $5 trillion economy, and the world’s third largest?Also Read | Explained: Why India is well positioned to deal with negative effects of Trump’s tariffs & top reasons it will be at an advantage India has been on the reform path in the last few years, with several major initiatives like the Goods and Services Tax, Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, digitalization, manufacturing sector push paving way for sustained economic growth.Experts also say that prudent fiscal and monetary policies have provided the foundation for a stable GDP growth.Sachchidanand Shukla - Group Chief Economist, L&T believes that India is one of the top players in the global growth league table today.“It is a result of structural reforms, policy continuity, and leveraging demographic and digital advantages. Key factors also include reforms such as: Goods and Services Tax, Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, Production-Linked Incentive and increased spending on infrastructure especially roads, railways, energy & defence,” he tells TOI.While the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code has significantly improved the health of the banking sector in India, the Goods and Services Tax is widely seen as the biggest indirect tax reform since independence. India’s GST collections in April hit a record all time high of Rs 2.37 lakh crore!Radhika Rao, Senior Economist at DBS Bank says that India’s trend growth continues to gain traction, strengthened by catalysts like investments into physical infrastructure, emphasis on improving human capital, streamlining direct subsidy transfers to beneficiaries, productivity gains from digitalisation, widening footprint in high value-added sectors including semiconductors, and expanding presence in global value chains.Also Read | Why India can be a big winner of Donald Trump 2.0 era if it plays its cards right “Equity markets have provided corporates with growth capital for investments, besides active participation of banks, private capital, and efforts to deepen the domestic corporate debt market,” she tells TOI.Ranen Banerjee, Partner, Government Sector Leader at PwC India explains that the positive cycle of a large young population has supported the continued consumption growth feeding into per capita income increase and consequently further boosting consumption. “This has helped and will continue to help in the growth of the Indian economy,” he tells TOI.The services sector growth leading to large employment in the ITES sector has led to a significant increase in middle income families further aiding growth.India may become the world’s 4th largest this year, but with the highest population in the world, its per capita GDP remains abysmally low.A large population (1.4 billion) dilutes gains of the GDP doubling. Also, informal employment (~90% of workforce) and low female workforce participation (26% vs. global 47%) limit per capita gains, says Sachchidanand Shukla.Still, the per capita income has close to doubled over the last 10 years. “That is keeping pace with the overall GDP growth as the population growth is slowing down with fertility rates going close to the replacement rate of 2.2. However, there are regional disparities owing to differential population growth rates as well as pace of economic development,” says Ranen Banerjee.India will realise its dream of becoming a $5 trillion economy in 2027 and the world’s third largest in 2028 by overtaking Germany. But to be on the path of stable and sustained economic growth, experts stress on the need for continuous reforms.PwC’s Ranen Banerjee advocates for reforms that enable private enterprise to do business without the fear by decriminalising regulatory compliances with application of technology to support in compliances.“Progressive labour reforms incrementally to allow for greater acceptance of the changes should be the way forward making these changes in special business enclaves. A disproportionate investment in skilling will be key to make the youth employable as it will lay the foundation of social stability and prosperity,” Ramen Banerjee says.Also Read | India has the world's 7th highest gold reserves! Why is RBI buying gold and how does it help the Indian economy? “Enabling exports through common facilities for quality outputs by MSMEs and continued investment in infrastructure to bring down logistics cost and enhance evacuation capabilities will be needed,” he adds.L&T’s Shukla says, “Going forward India will need to undertake deep agricultural reforms, labour reforms, education & skilling at a scale along with judicial administrative & police reforms,” he says.Radhika Rao of DBS Bank sees the need to focus on employment generation. “Wheels of the structural engine will require to be oiled by keeping the development and reform agenda on track. Quality of growth is also likely to improve as macro balances remain in check alongside a changing trade composition. Lifting employment generation and by extension boosting incomes will be the vital objective for the administration in the rest of its term,” she says.There is little doubt that India is amongst the most important markets for all economies globally including the US and China. A stable political scenario at the central government level over the last 11 years along with continued reforms have bolstered global investors’ confidence. But for the fruits of this growth to trickle down to the entire population, it is important to ensure employment for the youth and a strong manufacturing sector base for sustained, stable, and reliable economic growth.","India was the 10th largest world economy in 2014 - come 2025 it will be the 4th largest - a six places jump in rankings in just 11 years!

A federal court ruled on Wednesday that US President Trump does not have the authority to impose broad tariffs on imports using emergency powers.The decision, delivered by a three-judge panel at the Court of International Trade in New York, came after several lawsuits argued that Trump exceeded his legal powers and caused economic disruption by using emergency authority to shape US trade policy, reported AP.Trump had imposed tariffs on most countries, arguing that the US trade deficit constituted a national emergency. He relied on the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to justify the tariffs, which targeted goods from countries including Canada, China, and Mexico.His administration claimed the move was necessary to combat illegal immigration and the flow of drugs into the US.However, the seven lawsuits challenging the tariffs argue that the law does not permit the use of tariffs and that trade deficits do not meet the law’s requirement of an ""unusual and extraordinary threat."" The US has run a trade deficit for 49 consecutive years.Trump’s administration contends that the courts upheld the then-President Richard Nixon’s use of emergency tariffs in 1971 and argues that only Congress, not the courts, has the authority to decide whether a president’s emergency declaration meets legal standards.Trump’s tariffs shook global markets and raised concerns about US economic growth, though economists say the overall impact appears to have been limited.The White House did not comment on the ruling, but the Trump administration is expected to appeal.","A federal court ruled that US President Trump does not have the authority to impose broad tariffs on imports using emergency powers.

Mumbai: The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (Irdai) urged insurance companies to prioritise expanding the number of people covered under insurance, not just improving insurance penetration metrics.

What’s a recent example of the TACO trade in action?

Why do markets react this way?

How has President Trump reacted to the “TACO trade” label?

Are there criticisms of the TACO trade idea?

(With inputs from agencies)

A term coined by Financial Times columnist Robert Armstrong, the “TACO trade” - short for “Trump Always Chickens Out” - has become a buzzword on Wall Street. It’s a nickname that pokes fun at US President Donald Trump ’s tendency to threaten high tariffs on imported goods, only to later retreat or water them down. For investors and market analysts, this pattern has become a recognized trading playbook: stocks initially plunge when Trump makes tariff threats, then rebound when he backs off - a cycle that has repeated multiple times throughout his presidency.The acronym TACO-“Trump Always Chickens Out”-is a tongue-in-cheek jab at Trump’s pattern of issuing bold tariff threats but often scaling them back or delaying their implementation. For example, when Trump extended the deadline for a 50% tariff on EU goods from June 1 to July 9, stock futures rose, reinforcing the TACO trade narrative. The term has gained traction among traders and in financial media as a shorthand for this market dynamic.Trump announces high tariffs or aggressive trade policies, sparking fears of trade wars or economic disruption.Stocks, particularly those tied to global trade, drop as investors react to the uncertainty.Trump delays, modifies, or cancels the tariffs, often citing ongoing negotiations or concessions from trading partners.Investors, anticipating this pattern, buy stocks at lower prices, leading to a market rally.This cycle has been observed multiple times, such as with tariff threats against the EU, China, and other trading partners.As per a Bloomberg report, “The thesis behind the TACO trade is: Buy the Trump tariff dip,” Tom Essaye of the Sevens Report wrote in a note to clients on Wednesday. “Essentially, Trump has proven to investors that he won’t actually follow through with draconian tariffs. As such, any sell-off following a dramatic tariff threat should be bought.”One key episode happened this month when Trump threatened to impose a 50% tariff on European goods starting June 1, causing a market slump. But soon after, he extended the deadline to July 9 to allow for more negotiations, triggering a rebound in stock futures.Markets dislike uncertainty. Trump’s tariff threats create fears of higher costs, disrupted supply chains, and retaliatory trade measures. However, when he backs off, the relief fuels optimism, leading to stock rallies. The TACO trade reflects investors’ growing confidence that Trump’s threats are often a negotiation tactic rather than a firm commitment, allowing them to capitalize on temporary market dips.Trump has pushed back strongly on the nickname, calling it a “nasty question” and insisting it misrepresents his approach. On Wednesday in the Oval Office, a reporter’s question about the TACO trade sparked a heated response from Trump, who called the question “nasty.”“They wouldn’t be over here today negotiating if I didn’t put a 50% tariff on,” Trump said. “The sad thing is, now, when I make a deal with them - it’s something much more reasonable - they’ll say, ‘Oh, he was chicken. He was chicken.’ That’s unbelievable.”Yes. Some argue the TACO trade oversimplifies Trump’s negotiation strategy. Supporters say his tariff threats have led to real wins, like Colombia agreeing to deportees or investment commitments from trade partners. But critics note that the repeated backtracking reduces the credibility of future threats, making trading partners less likely to take them seriously over time","The ‘TACO trade’ is short for ‘Trump Always Chickens Out’ It’s a nickname that pokes fun at US President Donald Trump ’s tendency to threaten high tariffs on imported goods.

"Polls, project delays hit construction equipment market",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/polls-project-delays-hit-construction-equipment-market/articleshow/121476914.cms,"File photo

NEW DELHI: Sales of heavy construction equipment, a key barometer of growth of infrastructure projects, such as roads and highways, airports, ports, industrial parks and mining, grew at its slowest in the last financial year. Restrictions on the announcement of new projects due to election rules as well as a slowdown in ongoing central and state projects, led to a contraction in demand.Against healthy double-digit growths recorded previously, the industry saw a 3% rise in FY25, with purchases of heavy equipment slowing down uncharacteristically. The Rs 86,000 crore construction equipment industry, a key contributor to almost all the large infrastructure projects across the country, grew by 24% in FY24 and 21% in the year before that, according to data sourced from the Indian Construction Equipment Manufacturers Association (ICEMA).Companies, such as Caterpillar, JCB, Tata Hitachi Construction Machinery, Cummins, and Volvo CE are major providers of machinery.ICEMA president V Vivekanand, who is also MD of the Indian subsidiary of Caterpillar, said restrictions on new project announcements due to the model code of conduct before elections saw the central govt, as well as some states (which also went to polls), delay new project announcements.Vivekanand told TOI that even the infrastructure activities slowed down during the year. ""The pace of execution is a cause of concern. The pace of construction of roads has slowed down, not just the national highways but even the rural roads. Sometimes the projects were not delivered on time, and in other cases, the projects were not awarded on time and thus got delayed. Even in mining, demand was muted for the past 15 months. ""Deepak Shetty, CEO & MD of Indian operations of British manufacturer JCB, said payments to contractors were believed to have been delayed in many states, which led to a slowdown in purchases of new equipment. ""Work on many state highways has also slowed down. In some cases, there is a lack of availability of funds for infrastructure projects.""Sandeep Singh, MD of Tata Hitachi, said ""resolution of challenges in execution"" of projects is key to kickstart demand.""Govt support, in the form of incentives for both manufacturers and end-users, could accelerate this transition. Inclusion of construction equipment in the PM e-drive scheme and reduction of GST on electric machines are potential enablers,"" said Dimitrov Krishnan, MD of Volvo CE India.Jaideep Shekhar, the India MD of Terex, which is an American manufacturer of materials processing machinery, waste, and recycling equipment, said the industry remains optimistic about registering better growth going forward. ""The outlook remains positive, buoyed by the govt's emphasis on infrastructure development.""","Sales of heavy construction equipment, a key barometer of growth of infrastructure projects, grew at its slowest in last financial year.

Truck companies eye demand boost with ageing fleet on roads,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/truck-companies-eye-demand-boost-with-ageing-fleet-on-roads/articleshow/121476891.cms,"Photo/Agencies

CHENNAI: India's old trucks will help the commercial vehicle industry pick up speed on the demand highway. The average age of medium and heavy (M&HCV) trucks on Indian roads is currently at its highest at 10 years. According to truck manufacturing companies, this ageing fleet will translate into a ""significant"" increase in replacement demand .According to Icra's estimates, the average age of M&HCVs increased to around 10 years in FY23-25 after registering a gradual increase over the past years. ""The elevated level of vehicle ageing was fuelled by deferment of new vehicle purchases by fleet owners during the pandemic period and also with the domestic M&HCV (trucks) volumes staying flattish y-o-y in FY24 and registering a 4% y-o-y decline in FY25,"" said Kinjal Shah, senior VP, Icra. ""With this, the average M&HCV vehicle age presently remains the highest in the past two decades,"" added Shah.Already truck manufacturing companies are taking note of this opportunity. ""The outlook for the truck industry in FY26 takes into account the all-time high ageing of the truck fleet, which means fleet replacement will definitely happen. The demand pull will be predominantly in the M&HCV segment because the fleet is higher vintage there,"" said Shenu Agarwal, MD & CEO, Ashok Leyland.Vinod Aggarwal, MD & CEO, Volvo Eicher Commercial Vehicles said, ""Replacement demand will be very strong, particularly since with improved road infrastructure, the new trucks are running around 15,000km to 20,000km per month compared to around 8000km to 10,000km that older trucks manage."" Newer products, packed with telematics, offer more rigorous usage and faster turnaround time, he added.Currently replacement demand is 60% of the medium and heavy truck sales. However, overall sales have still not reached the 2018-19 peak of 2,95,000 units (it was 2,48,000 units in FY25).","The average age of medium and heavy (M&HCV) trucks on Indian roads is currently at its highest at 10 years.

High valuations trigger global investor cashout,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/high-valuations-trigger-global-investor-cashout/articleshow/121476872.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: The surge in repatriation or disinvestment by investors was driven by overseas players seeking to cash in on higher valuations in India. They exited through IPOs, stock market sales, and ""private arrangements,"" with Singtel's share sale in Bharti Airtel, IndiGo co-founder Rakesh Gangwal's sale through block deals in IndiGo parent Interglobe, and Hyundai's dilution through the public issue in its Indian arm being the top contributors.Official data accessed by TOI showed that during the last financial year, 95% of the disinvestment or repatriation was related to these three categories, with two-thirds of all divestments happening through the stock market route. Overall, 58% of the remittances were linked to stock market transactions, while another 28% were on account of private arrangements, including private placements and preferential allotments.As Gangwal sold more shares in Interglobe and BAT announced a fresh sale in ITC, the trend has continued into the current fiscal year as well. The two transactions in as many days between them garnered a little under Rs 25,000 crore (around $2.9 billion).Latest data released by RBI pegged disinvestment of shares in Indian entities during the last financial year at over $51 billion. Along with outward FDI of $29 billion, this resulted in net FDI inflows of just under $400 million, 96% lower than the previous year.In its monthly Bulletin, RBI described it as ""a sign of a mature market where foreign investors can enter and exit smoothly, reflecting positively on the Indian economy. ""Govt sources, however, said that too much should not be read into the numbers as foreign players, particularly private equity investors, were exiting a part of their investment in domestic companies at a premium. Apart from the Hyundai parent, investors in Swiggy and rival Eternal (formerly Zomato) also decided to book profits on their investments in the two food delivery companies.When it comes to outward FDI, the Mittals of Bharti Group acquired a stake in BT Group in the UK, apart from several other companies seeking to tap into opportunities overseas. ""That Indian overseas direct investment increased nearly by $12.5 billion during FY25, even as uncertainty reigned in the world, warrants attention, especially given their cautious attitude towards domestic investment,"" the finance ministry's monthly economic report said.","Investors exited through IPOs, stock market sales, and ""private arrangements"" Singtel's share sale in Bharti Airtel, IndiGo co-founder Rakesh Gangwal's sale through block deals were top contributors.

NEW DELHI: The country's industrial output growth slowed to an 8-month low in April, dragged down by a contraction in mining, sluggish electricity and manufacturing sectors, and a high base effect. Data released by the National Statistics Office (NSO) on Wednesday showed the index of industrial production (IIP) grew by 2.7% in April, lower than the upwardly revised 3.9% in March and below the 5.2% recorded in April last year.The manufacturing sector remained subdued, growing by 3.4% in April, lower than the 4.2% in the same period a year earlier. The mining sector contracted by 0.2% compared with a 6.8% growth in April last year, while the electricity sector rose 1.1% compared with a 10.2% expansion in the same period last year.""While the IIP growth expectedly eased to 2.7% in April 2025 from the upwardly revised 3.9% in March 2025, the extent of the dip was much lower than expectations, given the slump in the core sector growth, suggesting that the non-core portion of the IIP witnessed relatively healthier growth in the month,"" said Aditi Nayar, chief economist at ratings agency ICRA.""The slowdown, albeit mild, was broad-based, driven by a weaker performance across all three production sectors.However, the performance of the use-based sectors was mixed, with three of the six witnessing an improvement, including capital goods, intermediate goods, and consumer non-durables,"" said Nayar.The capital goods sector, a key gauge of industrial activity, rose by 20.3% during the month, higher than the 2.8% expansion in April last year, while the consumer durables sector grew by 6.4% in April compared with the 10.5% expansion in April last year. The consumer non-durables sector contracted 1.7% compared with a decline of 2.5% in April last year. The infra and construction goods sector also slowed, rising by 4% in April compared with an 8.5% growth in April last year.""The Centre's capex contracted by 4% during Jan-Feb FY25 following a pick-up in Q3. Given this weak momentum, the pace of capex revival remains a critical watch going ahead,"" said Rajani Sinha, chief economist at ratings agency CareEdge.","The index of industrial production (IIP) grew by 2.7% in April, lower than the upwardly revised 3.9% in March and below the 5.2% recorded in April last year.

MUMBAI: Sebi passed an interim order against IndusInd Bank's former CEO and four other former & current senior executives alleging insider trading and disclosure lapses related to a hit on the lender's earnings from incorrect accounting of derivative contracts. This is the first time a bank chief has faced insider trading allegations by Sebi.Sebi barred them from dealing in securities until further orders and impounded Rs 19.8 crore - the amount of loss allegedly avoided by the executives by selling shares before accounting discrepancies were disclosed.The five executives - ex-MD & CEO Sumant Kathpalia, ex-deputy CEO Arun Khurana, head of treasury operations Sushant Sourav, head of global markets group operations Rohan Jathanna, and chief administrative officer of consumer banking operations Anil Marco Rao - were accused of trading in IndusInd shares while in possession of unpublished price-sensitive information (UPSI).Sebi stated they were aware of a significant financial impact due to accounting discrepancies as early as Nov 2023, but the information was disclosed to the public only in March 2025. Sebi's probe found that the senior management knew by Nov 21, 2023, that the bank's incorrect accounting treatment of derivatives would impact its balance sheet. Internal emails showed the CFO flagged the issue on Nov 20-21, while the MD & CEO acknowledged a ""huge impact"" in a Dec 4 email.Despite this, the bank failed to classify the matter as UPSI until March 4, 2025. The regulator noted that material financial figures - including a Rs 1,750-crore impact for the Sept 2023 quarter - were internally finalised and circulated by Dec 11, 2023.Khurana and Kathpalia resigned in April 2025 taking responsibility for the derivatives losses.

NEW DELHI: In a relief for former Sebi chief Madhabi Puri Buch , anti-corruption watchdog Lokpal has disposed of complaints against her, describing them as ""untenable, unsubstantiated and bordering on frivolity"".After examining all five charges against Puri Buch, the agency decided against ordering an investigation. ""...we have concluded that the allegations in the complaint(s) are more on presumptions and assumptions and not supported by any verifiable material and do not attract the ingredients of the offences,"" it said.Complainants, including Trinamool lawmaker Mohua Moitra, had approached the Lokpal, alleging conflict of interest and quid pro quo by Buch during her tenure as a whole-time member and subsequently as Sebi chairman.""...the complaint(s) under consideration were essentially founded on the Hindenburg Report dated Aug 10, 2024, by a known short seller trader whose focus was to expose or corner Adani Group of companies.As noted in our order dated Sept 20, 2024, that report by itself cannot be made the sole basis to escalate action against the RPS (respondent public servant),"" the six-member bench led by chairperson Justice AM Khanwilkar said in its 36-page order.There were five main allegations, including the former regulator and her husband Dhaval Buch investing in a fund linked to investments in Adani group companies which were under scrutiny for stock price manipulation. Puri Buch was accused of not disclosing her investments.Based on her response, the Lokpal concluded that she was not involved with the probe and she and her spouse had redeemed their investments before the investigations started. It also noted that Puri Buch and Dhaval were not in control of where the fund invested the money.On allegations that Dhaval received money from M&M Group on the pretext of consultancy, Lokpal said he was a qualified professional who took up the assignment post-retirement and his remuneration was much less than what he earned at Unilever. It also dismissed suggestions of Puri Buch influencing cases against M&M Group, pointing out that three cases were not related to the group.The watchdog also dismissed charges of quid pro quo in the case of Blackstone, where Dhaval was engaged in a consulting role.","Anti-corruption watchdog Lokpal has disposed of complaints against former Sebi chief Madhabi Puri Buch.

Macy’s beats Q1 estimates but lowers 2025 profit outlook amid tariff impact,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/macys-beats-q1-estimates-but-lowers-2025-profit-outlook-amid-tariff-impact/articleshow/121469466.cms,"Macy’s Inc. reported a decline in first-quarter sales and profit on Wednesday, but still managed to surpass Wall Street expectations. The department store chain, however, revised its full-year profit forecast downward, citing more cautious consumer behaviour and the rising cost impact from US trade tariffs.Sales for the three months ended May 3 dropped to $4.79 billion from $5 billion a year ago, beating analysts’ expectations of $4.42 billion, according to FactSet. Comparable sales, which include online and store performance, fell 2%. Macy’s noted comparable sales growth at its higher-end Bloomingdale’s and cosmetics chain Bluemercury, AP reported.Despite the overall decline, Macy’s CEO Tony Spring said the company is carefully managing its pricing strategy amid the evolving tariff landscape. “I think it’s important to understand that we are not just broadly increasing price,” Spring said during a conference call. “We’re being incredibly surgical about the situation with tariffs.”Spring added that Macy’s is diversifying its supply chain and adjusting orders where necessary. “With the recent announcement of these tariffs, we’ve renegotiated orders with suppliers. We’ve canceled or delayed orders where the value proposition is just not where it needs to be,” he said.The retailer disclosed that about 20% of its products came from China at the end of its last fiscal year, with private label brands sourcing 27% from China, down from 32% the year before.Macy’s earned $38 million, or 13 cents per share, in the quarter, compared with $62 million, or 22 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, adjusted earnings came in at 16 cents per share — a penny above analyst estimates.Macy’s maintained its 2025 annual sales guidance between $21 billion and $21.4 billion but lowered its adjusted earnings projection to a range of $1.60 to $2 per share, down from its earlier forecast of $2.05 to $2.25. Analysts had anticipated $1.91 per share in adjusted profit.Shares rose 1% Wednesday following the earnings release.Industry expert Neil Saunders of GlobalData noted Macy’s quarter was relatively solid, especially as the company continues to shutter underperforming stores. “The 2.0% dip in comparable sales is below market growth but is not entirely unexpected,” Saunders wrote. “It is also, barring the robust holiday quarter, a somewhat better performance than Macy’s delivered across most of the last fiscal year.”The company previously announced plans to close 66 stores, most of which occurred during the first quarter.Macy’s joins a growing list of major US retailers navigating rising tariff-related costs and a cautious consumer base. American Eagle Outfitters and Ross Stores recently withdrew their financial outlooks, citing economic uncertainty. Target and Home Depot have also warned of pricing pressures due to tariffs.President Donald Trump’s tariff policies have sparked industry-wide concern. While a recent agreement scaled back some import taxes on Chinese goods to 30% and delayed others, the administration continues to float threats of new levies, including a potential 50% tax on EU imports and a 25% tariff on smartphones unless domestically produced.Despite the pressures, Spring said Macy’s remains committed to balancing competitive pricing and margin stability. “We’re making selective price increase in selective brands, selective categories, because we believe the value equation for the customer is still very relevant,” he said. “So some of the impact on our gross margin this year is going to be around the tariffs, but we’re also investing in getting market share because we really do believe as we get into the back half of the year, that price value dimension is going to be very critical. ”","Macy's Inc. reported a decline in first-quarter sales and profit on Wednesday, but still managed to surpass Wall Street expectations.

However, its net profit of $18.78 billion fell slightly short of the expected $19.49 billion.Earnings came in at 73 cents per share, up from 61 cents a year ago.Shares of the California-based chipmaker rose over 4% in after-hours trading. Nvidia closed the regular session as the world’s second-most valuable company, just behind Microsoft, with a market cap of $3.3 trillion.Investors are closely watching to see if Nvidia can continue its streak of beating analyst expectations for an eighth straight quarter.GameStop shares rose 6% following its announcement of a $1.3 billion private offering, part of which will be used to buy bitcoin. That mirrored a similar move by Trump Media and Technology Group a day earlier, which said it raised $2.5 billion and planned to build up a bitcoin reserve.Investors are awaiting Nvidia’s Q1 earnings, due after the market closes. The California-based chipmaker, seen as a key player in the AI boom, is expected to post earnings of 73 cents per share on $43 billion in sales — up from 61 cents per share and $26 billion last year.Analysts are watching closely to see whether Nvidia can extend its streak of beating Wall Street expectations for an eighth consecutive quarter.Despite Nvidia’s strong positioning, 2025 has been volatile for chipmakers.

Raghuram Rajan explains importance of foreign students in US

What's the curb on foreign students?

US President Donald Trump ’s move to curb entry of foreign students in the US has been criticised by Raghuram Rajan . The former RBI governor has warned that if the pipeline of international students into America is hit, it will have long-term consequences for the US economy.Statistics show that international students constitute 5.9% of nearly 19 million students in US higher education. During the 2023-2024 academic year, the US welcomed over 1.1 million international students, with India leading in numbers, followed by China.Speaking to Bloomberg TV, Rajan emphasised that the influx of overseas students has traditionally been vital for America's economic dominance and innovative capabilities, but present-day policies threaten to diminish this strategic advantage.""The Sergey Brins of the world came as students and did wonders for the US economy,"" Rajan said, referencing Google's co-founder. ""To some extent, the problem is the universities haven't made the case that they are so central to US growth, but also central to the distribution of that growth.""Also Read | Remittances tax: How Donald Trump's 'The One Big Beautiful Bill’ may turn out to be ugly for Indians in the US Currently serving as a professor of finance at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, Rajan highlighted that restricting foreign student enrolment could affect employment growth, citing how organisations such as Alphabet Inc.'sGoogle have created thousands of jobs, partially due to their access to immigrant talent.What began as scrutiny of prestigious institutions like Harvard University and Columbia University regarding antisemitism has evolved into a broader challenge to US higher education's foundation.The Trump administration intensified this situation on Tuesday by directing US embassies globally to halt student visa interview scheduling whilst considering more rigorous social media screening of applicants.Secretary of State Marco Rubio has instructed all American embassies globally to cease scheduling student visa interviews whilst the administration evaluates enhanced scrutiny of applicants' social media accounts.In a diplomatic cable sent to embassy staff worldwide, this latest measure represents another step in the US government's efforts to limit international student access to American educational institutions, citing concerns about national security and antisemitic behaviour.Also Read | ‘Will not discuss…’: US tells WTO that India has no basis to impose retaliatory duties on 29 American products The cable stated: ""Effective immediately, in preparation for an expansion of required social media screening and vetting, consular sections should not add any additional student or exchange visitor (F, M and J) visa appointment capacity until further guidance is issued.""Rajan expressed his unease about the current situation, noting the growing anxiety amongst academic staff and leadership regarding visa stability and potential governmental repercussions. ""It is not a great environment,"" he said. ""It's an environment which is inhibiting the ultimate production that the universities contribute to the US economy.""Rajan also highlighted how international students' current decision-making process resembles business investment behaviour during uncertain periods. ""If uncertainty increases, you tend to either postpone the investment or take it to a place where things are more certain,"" he said.","Raghuram Rajan has warned that if the pipeline of international students into America is hit, it will have long-term consequences for the US economy.

Additionally, China faces increasing resistance from Europe and the United States regarding export surge.The factors driving Chinese exports upward are simultaneously dampening business prospects within China. Local enterprises, often supported by government incentives, have invested extensively in sectors like electric vehicles, resulting in production capacity exceeding market demand.This excess capacity has triggered intense price competition, reducing profits and encouraging companies to expand into international markets.In Europe, concerns are rising that increased Chinese imports could affect domestic manufacturing and employment. The EU implemented duties on Chinese electric vehicles last year, citing unfair subsidisation of EV production.""I think there's a clear perception that the benefits of the bilateral trade and investment relationship are not being distributed in an equitable manner,"" stated Jens Eskelund, EU Chamber in China president, during a recent press briefing.While acknowledging China's efforts to enhance consumer spending, Eskelund emphasised the need for government action to balance supply growth with demand.The survey findings indicate increased pressure on profits over the past year, with business confidence continuing to decline, he continued.Approximately 500 member organisations participated in the survey conducted between mid-January to mid-February. ""It is just very difficult for everyone right now in an environment of declining margins,"" Eskelund added.","European firms are cutting costs and pulling back on investment plans in China, according to an annual survey released Wednesday.

Nvidia shares rise ahead of earnings as investors eye impact of US chip curbs on China,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/nvidia-shares-rise-ahead-of-earnings-as-investors-eye-impact-of-us-chip-curbs-on-china/articleshow/121444094.cms,"Nvidia shares climbed over 3 per cent to $135.16 in early trading on Tuesday as investors brace for the company’s earnings report due Wednesday, focusing on the financial impact of recent US export restrictions on its China business.Nvidia shares were trading 3.10 per cent higher at $135.36 as of 11:07 am ET.The Biden administration’s export controls, building on measures introduced last year, have limited Nvidia’s ability to sell its advanced H20 AI chip to China. Nvidia has disclosed that these curbs could result in $5.5 billion in charges.CEO Jensen Huang previously estimated the AI chip market in China could reach $50 billion next year but admitted the company had already lost approximately $15 billion in potential sales due to the restrictions, Reuters reported.China accounted for about 13 per cent of Nvidia’s revenue last year, but the company does not break out sales specifically for the H20 chip. Analysts at Wedbush highlighted that the key question for Nvidia’s upcoming earnings will be whether it can compensate for lost sales from the H20 chip and its China operations with growth elsewhere.Despite reports that Nvidia plans to launch a new AI chipset for China based on its latest Blackwell architecture, ongoing uncertainty around China sales has weighed on the stock.Year-to-date, Nvidia’s shares are down about 2 per cent, a sharp contrast to their nearly threefold gain in 2024.“China will probably be the biggest swing factor for Nvidia’s quarter,” said Gil Luria, analyst at D.A. Davidson.Nvidia is expected to report first-quarter revenue of $43.28 billion, representing a 66.2 per cent year-on-year increase, according to LSEG data. However, analysts at Susquehanna estimate the export curbs impacted the final three weeks of the April quarter, costing the company roughly $1 billion in sales. For the remainder of the year, lost revenue could reach $4.5 billion per quarter, Wedbush analysts project a quarterly hit between $3 billion and $4 billion.Gross margins are also expected to take a hit, with Wedbush forecasting an 11 percentage point drop to 67.7 per cent, partly due to write-downs related to H20 shipments, which could reduce margins by as much as 12.5 per cent.Nvidia CEO Huang recently criticized the semiconductor export restrictions as counterproductive, stating they have accelerated Chinese competitors like Huawei’s development of domestic chip technology.On a positive note, easing of some Biden-era export controls under the AI diffusion rule may open up new markets for Nvidia in regions such as the Middle East. Nvidia has already announced plans to supply hundreds of thousands of AI chips to Saudi Arabia, including 18,000 of its Blackwell chips to a start-up backed by the Saudi sovereign wealth fund.Investor confidence has also been bolstered by renewed AI investment from major cloud providers, including Alphabet’s Google, which has pledged continued spending despite earlier concerns of a slowdown.“I don’t think investors’ expectations are very high as we go into it,” said Ivana Delevska, CIO at Spear Invest, which holds Nvidia shares in an actively managed ETF.As Nvidia reports its earnings on Wednesday, all eyes will be on how the company navigates the twin challenges of regulatory restrictions in China and rising AI infrastructure costs.","N Nvidia shares were trading 3.10 per cent higher at $135.36 as of 11:07 am ET on Tuesday.

Japan is no longer the world’s leading creditor nation - and that’s a first in 34 years! Germany has taken the top spot despite Japan's record overseas assets. Japan had held the top position since surpassing Germany in 1991.Japan's position as the world's leading net-creditor nation over the years was due to decades of current account surpluses, leading to substantial foreign investments by Japanese entities.According to the Ministry of Finance data quoted by Bloomberg, Japan's net external assets reached ¥533.05 trillion ($3.7 trillion) at the end of 2024, showing a 13% increase from the previous year. Although this figure was a record high, Germany surpassed it with net external assets of ¥569.7 trillion. China maintained its third position with net assets of ¥516.3 trillion.Germany's rise to the top position is attributed to its substantial current account surplus of €248.7 billion in 2024, primarily due to strong trade performance. In comparison, Japan's surplus was ¥29.4 trillion, approximately €180 billion, according to the finance ministry.The loss of this position indicates that whilst Japan's assets continue to grow, other nations, including Germany and China, have experienced stronger actual demand.Also Read | ‘Will not discuss…’: US tells WTO that India has no basis to impose retaliatory duties on 29 American products A nation's net foreign assets represent the difference between its overseas assets and domestic assets owned by foreigners, adjusted for currency value changes. This calculation essentially reflects the cumulative changes in the country's current account.The euro-yen exchange rate increased by about 5% last year, amplifying the difference between German and Japanese assets when measured in yen.On Tuesday, Minister of Finance Katsunobu Kato indicated he was not concerned about this development.Kato explained to reporters that Japan's consistent growth in net external assets means the ranking shouldn't be viewed as a significant shift in Japan's standing.Japan experienced growth in both foreign assets and liabilities, with assets showing stronger growth due to increased international business investments, influenced by the yen's depreciation.The data released on Tuesday aligns with broader foreign direct investment patterns.

President Donald Trump's tariff policies might influence some firms to transfer assets or production to the US to address trade-related concerns.However, Karakama noted that these uncertainties might also lead some companies to prefer domestic operations and avoid higher-risk investments.","Germany has taken the top spot despite Japan's record overseas assets.

Consumer confidence in the United States saw a significant rebound in May, breaking a five-month streak of declines that had dragged sentiment to its lowest point since the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic.The Conference Board reported on Tuesday that its Consumer Confidence Index rose to 98, up from 85.7 in April, a 12.3-point increase and the largest monthly gain in over two years.The improvement comes as Americans grow more optimistic about the economy, with inflation easing slightly, job growth holding steady, and fears over former President Donald Trump’s tariff policies subsiding. In recent months, elevated prices- partly fueled by lingering tariffs on Chinese imports had heightened consumer anxiety and dampened economic outlooks, as reported by AP.A key sub-index tracking short-term expectations for income, business conditions, and the labor market surged 17.4 points to 72.8. Although still below the 80-point threshold that typically signals economic growth, the uptick marks a notable turnaround in public sentiment.The share of consumers expecting a recession within the next 12 months also declined, suggesting that Americans are feeling more hopeful about the near-term future.Consumer spending, which drives roughly two-thirds of US economic activity, could benefit from this renewed confidence. Economists and Federal Reserve officials will be closely watching upcoming data for signs that improving sentiment translates into stronger economic performance in the months ahead.Consumer confidence is an economic indicator that measures how optimistic or pessimistic consumers feel about their financial situation and the overall state of the economy, both in the present and in the near future.","The Conference Board reported on Tuesday that its Consumer Confidence Index rose to 98, up from 85.7 in April.

Salesforce announced on Tuesday that it will acquire Informatica for approximately $8 billion, marking its biggest deal since acquiring Slack Technologies in 2021. The move signals a return to large-scale mergers and acquisitions for the cloud software giant as it looks to strengthen its capabilities in the rapidly evolving artificial intelligence market.After previously shelving talks with Informatica last year due to disagreements over terms, Salesforce is now betting that the data management platform can enhance its competitiveness in the AI space. The deal, valued at $25 per share, represents a roughly 30% premium to Informatica’s closing price on May 22, the day before news of renewed negotiations surfaced.Shares of Informatica rose 5.8% in premarket trading to $23.86, while Salesforce was up 1.2%.Buying Informatica will allow Salesforce to expand its suite of data management tools and tighten control over how business data is handled—an increasingly critical factor as the company integrates generative AI across its product offerings, Reuters reported.""Salesforce and Informatica will create the most complete, agent-ready data platform in the industry,"" said Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, emphasizing that the acquisition will enhance the company’s position in the $150 billion-plus data enterprise market.Salesforce has been actively developing AI agents—software programs capable of handling routine tasks without human intervention—for applications like recruiting and customer service. Its AI platform, Agentforce, has already secured more than 1,000 paid customer deals.Scotiabank analysts noted that the acquisition could help Salesforce better compete with other major software providers, pointing out that ""data management software is now most often sold as part of mega-vendor tool kits.""The deal will be financed through a combination of cash and new debt, with Salesforce expecting to complete the transaction early in its next fiscal year starting February. The company also anticipates the acquisition will begin contributing to operating margin improvements from the second year after closing.Salesforce has a history of high-profile acquisitions, including its $15.7 billion purchase of data analytics firm Tableau Software in 2019.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Stay informed with the latest business news, updates on bank holidays and public holidays.





Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.","Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain.

"Indian Railways announces three big steps for train ticketing! New charting, Tatkal ticket booking, reservation system",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/infrastructure/indian-railways-announces-three-big-steps-for-train-ticketing-new-charting-tatkal-ticket-booking-reservation-system-what-they-means-for-passengers/articleshow/122143108.cms,"We take a look at the top three upcoming changes in train ticketing and what they mean for passengers:

We take a look at the top three upcoming changes in train ticketing and what they mean for passengers:

Train Chart Preparation 8 Hours in Advance

Currently, Indian Railways prepares reservation charts four hours prior to train departure. This uncertainty particularly affects those travelling from nearby locations to board their trains.

To address this concern, a new proposal suggests preparing reservation charts eight hours before departure time.

For trains scheduled before 1400 hours on a day, charts will be finalised at 2100 hrs on the preceding day.

The Railway Minister has endorsed this suggestion and instructed phased implementation to ensure smooth transition.

This revised system will provide clarity to passengers holding waitlisted tickets. They will receive updates about their waitlist status earlier than before.

The change will particularly assist travellers from distant areas or city outskirts who plan to board long-distance trains. Additionally, passengers will have sufficient time to plan alternative travel arrangements if their waitlisted tickets remain unconfirmed.

Only Verified Users for Tatkal Ticket Booking

Indian Railways has announced that starting July 1, 2025, only verified users will be permitted to book Tatkal tickets through the IRCTC website and mobile application.

through the IRCTC website and mobile application. Additionally, the implementation of OTP-based authentication for Tatkal bookings will commence from end of July.

The Railways Minister has directed the officials to expand the authentication process for Tatkal reservations.

Users will need to verify their identity using either Aadhaar or other valid government identification documents stored in their DigiLocker accounts.

Earlier, it had been announced that only Aadhaar-authenticated users will be able to book tatkal tickets from July 1, 2025. The scope of that is now being expanded to include documents in DigiLocker.

New Passenger Reservation System by December 2025

The Railways Minister conducted an assessment of passenger reservation system improvements. CRIS has been implementing this enhancement project over recent months.

The enhanced PRS infrastructure demonstrates adaptability, flexibility and expanded capacity, capable of managing ten times the existing volume. This substantial upgrade will boost ticket booking capabilities significantly.

The modernised system will facilitate over 150,000 ticket reservations per minute, representing a fivefold increase from the current capacity of 32,000 tickets per minute.

The system's enquiry processing ability will see a tenfold enhancement, expanding from 400,000 to more than 4 million enquiries per minute.

The upgraded PRS features a user-friendly interface supporting multiple languages for bookings and enquiries.

The enhanced system enables users to specify seating preferences and view fare calendars. Additionally, it incorporates dedicated facilities for Divyangjan, students, patients and other specific categories.

Indian Railways train ticket operations set for a major revamp: In a move aimed at enhancing comfort for passengers, Indian Railways is planning to gradually roll out three key changes to its passenger reservation system. The steps will involve a new procedure for booking tatkal train tickets, advance chart preparation for waitlisted passengers and the overall upgradation of the passenger reservation system.During a recent assessment of these improvements, Railway Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw stressed the importance of developing an intelligent, clear, user-friendly and productive ticketing system. The primary focus of planning should be passenger comfort, ensuring that travellers experience seamless and pleasant journeys throughout their rail travel, he has said.Indian Railways is also considering eliminating or lowering the clerical charges, known as ""clerkage"", which it currently deducts whilst processing refunds for unconfirmed waitlisted tickets or cancellations. Presently, the railways collects Rs 60 as clerkage for reserved AC and non-AC tickets, whilst Rs 30 is charged for unreserved second class tickets. This fee applies to all waitlisted ticket cancellations, including those processed through the IRCTC website.Officials told TOI that preliminary discussions have begun regarding this matter. Should the Railways implement this change, it would benefit passengers holding waitlisted tickets who currently face two challenges: their tickets remaining unconfirmed and the subsequent deduction of clerkage charges during fare refunds.","Indian Railways is planning to gradually roll out three key changes to its passenger reservation system.

Markets watchful: Asian stocks tick higher; oil slips on OPEC+ output hike concerns,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/markets-watchful-asian-stocks-tick-higher-oil-slips-on-opec-output-hike-concerns/articleshow/122171729.cms,"Representative image (Picture credit: AP)

Asian equities edged up on Tuesday while oil prices continued their decline amid uncertainty over US tariffs and expectations of increased crude supply by OPEC+.Investors remained cautious ahead of a crucial US Senate vote on President Donald Trump’s massive tax-and-spending bill and upcoming labour market data.As per news agency Reuters, MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.5 per cent, led by South Korea’s Kospi, which jumped 1.8 per cent.However, Japan’s Nikkei dropped up to 1.1 per cent as a stronger yen and fears over Trump’s tariff threat weighed on investor sentiment.Japanese equities also opened 0.9 per cent lower following concerns that fresh tariffs could hit the country’s exports, reported Bloomberg.Trump is pushing to pass a sweeping economic bill before the July 4 holiday, with debate continuing in the Senate. “Trade is front and centre this week, but alongside that, we've obviously got the fate of the 'One Big Beautiful Bill',” Ray Attrill of National Australia Bank was quoted as saying by Reuters.Meanwhile, the dollar fell near multi-year lows. The greenback dropped 0.3 per cent to 143.62 yen, and touched $1.1798 against the euro, its weakest since September 2021.Broader dollar weakness reflects ongoing trade tensions and expectations of potential Federal Reserve rate cuts, especially if Thursday’s US payrolls report shows slowing job growth.Oil prices slipped for the second day as traders braced for a possible output hike by OPEC+.Brent crude futures dipped 0.24 per cent to $66.58 a barrel, while US West Texas Intermediate dropped 0.31 per cent to $64.91.According to Reuters, four OPEC+ sources said the group may raise output by 411,000 barrels per day in August, adding to previous hikes and potentially boosting total supply by 1.78 million bpd this year.“The market is now concerned that the OPEC+ alliance will continue with its accelerated rate of output increases,” said ANZ’s Daniel Hynes in a client note, as cited by Reuters.US treasury secretary Scott Bessent also warned that higher tariffs could be reimposed from July 9, dampening global growth expectations. Concerns over the economic fallout from such moves further pressured oil prices.Gold prices, in contrast, rose 0.5 per cent to $3,319.55 per ounce as investors sought safety.With Wall Street coming off its best quarter since December 2023 and geopolitical risks easing after the Israel-Iran ceasefire, markets now await Thursday’s US jobs data, which could shape expectations for Fed action in the coming months.","MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.5%.

Protectionism among biz challenges: HUL chairman,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/protectionism-among-biz-challenges-hul-chairman/articleshow/122170901.cms,"Mumbai: Geopolitical uncertainties and rising protectionism are posing challenges for businesses globally, and companies will have to respond with speed and agility to protect their growth as they navigate these disruptions, said Nitin Paranjpe, non-executive chairman at Hindustan Unilever (HUL). ""The impact that technology will have on us, the impact that climate change will have on us is understood...we have to gear up to deal with it, but the direction is known...""""The new thing which is happening is the uncertainty...the geopolitical uncertainty, the world order as we have understood and known for the last several decades has been upended. That causes challenges for businesses. Decades-long globalisation suddenly giving way to protectionism and even that is not so linear....that's a challenge,"" Paranjpe told TOI in an exclusive interview on the sidelines of the company's annual general meeting (AGM) at its headquarters here on Monday.A strong domestic consumption and lesser reliance on export-led growth places India on a better footing compared to other countries like China, and India might even have an ""opportunity through all the resetting of the global order,"" Paranjpe said.This means businesses may escape the first-order effects of global uncertainties, but companies will have to deal with the second-order effects, Paranjpe explained, adding that traditional ""payback periods"" for firms will start getting challenged.""Trying to predict the future is a fool's errand, it's simply impossible. Therefore, finding a way by which you can structurally build in agility and the capacity to respond becomes far, far more important. Predictability has reduced, and so we need greater agility. As you start thinking of outcomes (from a business planning perspective), you have to start thinking of paybacks which will be shorter. That's what the world has to now deal with,"" Paranjpe said.To create a developed India, economic growth alongside environmental sustainability and social progress need to be prioritised, and India Inc has a major role to play in it, Paranjpe said in his AGM speech. HUL's mantra in this rapidly changing world is speed and agility. ""We are embedding technology across our value chain to enhance agility and resilience,"" Paranjpe said.As companies cater to changing consumer sentiments and preferences in a growing digital world that's reshaping trends, HUL's task is cut out: to craft a portfolio that can address people across the spectrum. The company's strategy will be to build tech-powered capabilities to service consumers. ""We have to become world-class in sensing change and build world-class capabilities to respond to that change by leveraging technology in a way we have never done before,"" Paranjpe said.Going ahead, the FMCG sector should see improvement in growth, helped by low inflation, tax benefits and likelihood of good monsoons. “As we move ahead, we should see reasonable volume growths coming back. Price growth is likely to be modest. We remain bullish on the market in the long-term,” Paranjpe said.","Nitin Paranjpe, non-executive chairman at Hindustan Unilever (HUL), spoke to TOI on the sidelines of the company's annual general meeting (AGM) at its headquarters here on Monday.

9th yr of GST may see rate rationalisation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/9th-yr-of-gst-may-see-rate-rationalisation/articleshow/122170859.cms,"New Delhi: The ninth year of the Goods and Services Tax (GST), which begins on Tuesday, could actually see the much-awaited rationalisation of the rates, although the shrinking of slabs from four major ones to three is unlikely.While the tax regime stabilised over eight years, this is evidenced by consistent rise in collections - from a monthly average of a little over Rs 1.2 lakh crore to more than Rs 1.8 lakh crore - and the number of taxpayers increasing to over Rs 1.5 crore by March-end.Name any agency or tax expert and rationalisation of tax rates is top item on the wish list. ""The next phase of GST must prioritise rationalising rates, reducing blocked credits in line with the neutrality principle, broadening the tax base, and removing procedural bottlenecks to restore the originally intended neutrality and efficiency of the system,"" consulting firm PwC said in a report released on Monday.Last week, a survey by Deloitte identified ""rationalising GST rates for the entire supply chain"" as the second most pressing issue. Although the original plan was to merge the 12% and 18% slabs and create a new one at 15-16%, it seems unlikely, given that some of the items in the 12% bracket will see an increase in rates, a political hot potato.

Airtel's request to convert dues into equity may not get govt nod,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/airtels-request-to-convert-dues-into-equity-may-not-get-govt-nod/articleshow/122170838.cms,"New Delhi: Airtel's request for conversion of its statutory dues into equity - on the lines of a bailout given to Vodafone Idea - may not be approved by the Department of Telecom (DoT) in view of healthy financial state of the company, govt sources said.Airtel surprised many when in April it approached DoT for conversion of its payments towards spectrum and AGR into an equity swap. This would have seen the govt receive a slice of the company's shareholding in lieu of outstanding payments, similar to what was done by the beleaguered Vodafone Idea, in which the govt now has a 49% stake.DoT, which has conducted a preliminary assessment of Airtel's demand, believes the company's request does not hold much merit. ""There seems to be no need to discuss this proposal. The company is sufficiently healthy and does not appear to be in need of such a financial bailout,"" top sources told TOI.Unlike Vodafone Idea, which has a debt in excess of Rs 2 lakh crore and is losing thousands of crores of rupees in losses every quarter, Airtel remains strong and healthy. In FY25, the company posted an over four-fold increase in consolidated net profit to Rs 33,556 crore from Rs 7,467 crore in FY24.Its annual revenue from operations grew 15% to Rs 1.7 lakh crore in the year ending March 31, 2025, from Rs 1.5 lakh crore in FY24.

Under the current regime, shipments from SEZs to an Indian seller in the DTA attract import duty equivalent to what any consignment from another country faces. If the amendments go through, in the case of, say, a shirt made in an SEZ using imported fabric, it will only attract the customs applicable to the fabric.Sources said the benefit is available in American foreign trade zones as well as comprehensive bonded zones in China, as well as some of the Indian schemes, such as those for export-oriented units.""It will attract foreign investment in the Indian SEZs. One cannot have separate factories for serving domestic and export markets,"" an industry source told TOI.Similarly, a provision of ""reverse job work"" has been made by the commerce department as the govt seeks to tap idle capacity in the zones, which lost steam after the UPA decided to withdraw several of the tax benefits that were originally offered in 2005.A third concern, which is sought to be addressed through the amendments, is to allow rupee payment for some of the services rendered by units in SEZs to the domestic tariff area. This will be applicable to services such as maintenance, repair, and operations (MRO) and space-Jrelated activities, sources said.","The commerce department is seeking to amend the law governing special economic zones (SEZs) Under the current regime, shipments from SEZs to an Indian seller in the DTA attract import duty equivalent to what any consignment from another country faces.

Rise of Zohran Mamdani

Wall Street worried

The possible victory of Zohran Mamdani, the 33-year-old democratic socialist, in the upcoming New York mayoral polls has people on Wall Street worried.In Manhattan's financial district, pessimistic predictions are circulating. According to Wall Street recruitment specialist Michael Nelson, his clientele, typically earning above $1 million annually, express serious concerns.""This will be the end of New York City as we know it"" reflects the sentiment amongst his affluent clients regarding Mamdani's potential November victory, he told Bloomberg.The impact is already visible in New York City property-related stocks. Flagstar Financial Inc., which provides loans to apartment complexes, experienced up to 6.7% decline on Wednesday. Property companies Empire State Realty Trust, SL Green Realty and Vornado Realty Trust also registered losses.Even critics acknowledge that Zohran Mamdani, the 33-year-old democratic socialist, has garnered significant public support.""It's officially hot commie summer,"" wrote hedge fund billionaire Dan Loeb on X, following Mamdani's unexpected victory over Andrew Cuomo in the Democratic primary for the New York City mayoral position.Also Read | Days of South Asians being ignored and erased in New York politics are gone, says Zohran Kwame Mamdani The statement reflects the genuine concern amongst the city's wealthy circles that a Mamdani victory in the November general election would result in increased taxation, potentially causing affluent residents to leave the five boroughs.An important detail is that Mamdani’s tax proposals would require approval from New York State Governor Kathy Hochul, who has expressed opposition. Additionally, Mamdani's plan to raise $70 billion in debt faces significant obstacles.According to Kathy Wylde, a prominent New York intermediary who has facilitated connections between business leaders from finance, real estate and media with city officials for years, whilst Mamdani appeals to the youth, his ideological stance causes significant concern among taxpayers and employers.However, Mamdani successfully gained support from voters across diverse socioeconomic and racial communities.In his Wednesday morning address, he emphasised that ""a life of dignity should not be reserved for a fortunate few.""The foundation of his success lay in a strategic social media campaign that combined populist economic policies and progressive cultural messaging through viral-worthy video content.On Tuesday, he featured in an Instagram video alongside Emily Ratajkowski, who commands over 29 million followers. The model and actress sported a ""Hot Girls for Zohran"" t-shirt whilst encouraging voter turnout.This exemplified the clever strategy that enabled Mamdani to build a substantial volunteer base numbering in tens of thousands. These supporters diligently canvassed neighbourhoods, maintained street presence and utilised social media to reach voters. They promoted his policy agenda: Free childcare, state-operated grocery shops with reduced prices, complimentary bus transport, rent controls and additional measures - largely funded through increased taxation of wealthy individuals.New York's establishment elite supported Cuomo, a 67-year-old Democratic veteran who positioned himself as an experienced centrist capable of addressing the city's challenges, from underground transit safety to the widely recognised cost-of-living issues.His campaign received substantial financial backing from prominent figures, including Michael R. Bloomberg, founder and primary owner of Bloomberg News parent Bloomberg LP, along with Bill Ackman, Loeb and Vornado's Steven Roth. His political action committee, Fix the City, accumulated an unprecedented primary campaign fund of nearly $25 million.However, the campaign's advertising strategy predominantly focused on criticising Mamdani rather than highlighting Cuomo's administrative plans. Despite resigning as New York governor following sexual harassment claims, which he contests, Cuomo maintained strong establishment support, including an endorsement from former President Bill Clinton.In contrast, Mamdani received endorsements from progressive leaders, including Democratic Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Senator Bernie Sanders.Some financial sector representatives appear to be considering a more accepting stance towards the democratic socialist candidate.""While we might disagree on certain issues, we should always be hopeful that Mamdani — if he ends up being elected mayor — can unite the city to address its critical education, public safety, housing and economic development needs,"" said Ralph Schlosstein, former head of Evercore Inc. and a longtime Democrat, according to the Bloomberg report.According to Rich Farley, an experienced Wall Street legal expert, numerous affluent residents view the November general election as crucial. A Mamdani victory could prompt wealthy individuals to seriously consider relocating from the city.Before this contest, high-net-worth donors must determine their stance towards Mamdani. Cuomo, potentially running as an independent, needs to convince supporters of his viability outside the Democratic primary framework.Should he continue his campaign, he will face Republican Curtis Sliwa and incumbent Eric Adams, who is running independently after avoiding the primary following corruption allegations.Some Wall Street professionals are contemplating more decisive actions.""I've already talked to hedge fund guys who have told me they have got a foot out the door,"" said Eric Rosen, who previously held senior positions at JPMorgan and in hedge fund management.""I left New York City 8 years ago because I didn't like the way the city was being run,"" he said. ""I sold my Park Ave. co-op and its now down 25% and my house in Florida is up 250%. The market has spoken.""","Zohran Mamdani, the 33-year-old democratic socialist, won the Democratic primary for the New York City mayoral position.

ITR Filing Deadline Extended: Why It Happened And What To Do Now? | Income Tax Return | Explained

ITR e-filing FY 2024-25: Which Form For Gig Workers?

Importantly, ITR-1 and ITR-2 do not apply to income from freelancing or gig work. Selecting the correct form is crucial for smooth return processing and to avoid errors or compliance notices.

Freelancers maintaining books of accounts and claiming actual business expenses should file ITR-3 .

. Alternatively, those in specified professions—such as legal, accounting, or technical consultancy etc—with gross receipts up to Rs 50 lakh (or Rs 75 lakh if cash receipts do not exceed 5% of the total gross receipts) may opt for ITR-4 under the presumptive taxation scheme. Under the presumptive taxation scheme, 50% of gross receipts are deemed taxable, simplifying compliance by eliminating the need for detailed bookkeeping.

Income Tax Return (ITR) e-filing FY 2024-25: ITR filing may be relatively straightforward for salaried individuals, but what about gig workers and those who earn through freelancing? With the rise of freelance and gig-based income, many individuals are unsure how to report such earnings correctly.The ITR filing for FY 2024-25 (AY 2025-26) has been partially thrown open on the Income Tax Portal incometax.gov.in. Individuals who have to file their tax returns using ITR-1 or ITR-4 forms can now do so. So which ITR form should gig workers and free lancers use to file their ITR for FY 2024-25?As non-traditional work arrangements grow, understanding the appropriate tax filing requirements is essential for freelancers and gig workers to remain compliant and minimize potential issues.According to Amarpal Chadha, Tax Partner, EY India, income from independent work—such as writing, design, consulting, tuition, or platform-based gigs like ride-sharing and food delivery—is treated as “Profits and Gains from Business or Profession” under Indian tax law.Amarpal Chadha tells TOI that ITR-4 cannot be filed if the taxpayer has incomes like short-term capital gains, long-term capital gains u/s 112A exceeding Rs 1.25 lakh, income from and reporting of foreign assets, etc.""If an individual who is a freelancer or gig worker has capital gains referred above, they will have to file ITR - 3. Ideally, ITR -3 isto be used for business income. However, ITR-4 is an option if your income in under certain limits to make the return process simpler.

Inspired by Warren Buffett’s investment mantras? These 3 stocks make up 66% of Bill Gates' Foundation's $45 billion portfolio — check list,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/inspired-by-warren-buffetts-investment-mantras-these-3-stocks-make-up-66-of-bill-gates-foundations-45-billion-portfolio-check-list/articleshow/122165059.cms,"Bill Gates stands amongst the world's richest individuals. (AI image)

Berkshire Hathaway (18.4%)

Microsoft (31.1.%)

Waste Management (16.2%)

With wealth surpassing $100 billion, Bill Gates stands amongst the world's richest individuals. His philanthropic contributions to the Gates Foundation, established in 2000, have exceeded $60 billion, demonstrating remarkable generosity. The investment portfolio of the Gates Foundation combines technological expertise and wisdom from a legendary investor's influence.Bill Gates’ personal investment holdings, which include substantial Microsoft shares (MSFT 0.60%) and various strategic investments, have largely funded these charitable contributions.Beyond Microsoft, Gates adopts a value-oriented investment approach, that appears to be influenced by his close associate and former Gates Foundation trustee and contributor, Warren Buffett , according to a report by The Motley Fool.The Foundation's investment strategy reflects both Gates and Buffett's financial philosophies, featuring a concentrated selection of the topmost investments. As a result, three exceptional stocks constitute approximately two-thirds of the foundation's trust fund holdings. We take a look at them.Warren Buffett remains a significant contributor to the Gates Foundation, with his contributions since 2006 exceeding $43 billion.His donations specifically comprise Class B shares of Berkshire Hathaway. He retains company control through a strategic approach of converting high-voting Class A shares to Class B shares prior to donation.The Foundation operates under specific conditions set by Buffett, requiring annual grant payments equivalent to his donation amount plus 5% of trust assets. Despite these requirements, the Foundation has retained substantial Berkshire Hathaway holdings, possessing 17.1 million shares valued at approximately $8.3 billion at the first quarter's end, the The Motley Fool report says.A significant portion of Berkshire's worth is derived from its portfolio of publicly traded equities and cash holdings. Its total liquid investments amount to approximately $631.8 billion. Buffett maintains more than half of this amount in Treasury bills or cash whilst searching for valuable investment opportunities. However, due to Berkshire's substantial size, only a limited number of companies remain as feasible investment targets.When Microsoft was established in 2000, Bill Gates initiated donations of company shares, consistently increasing his contributions over time. Despite utilising shares to support grants, the foundation has accumulated a significant position in the organisation. By the end of quarter one, the trust maintained approximately 28.5 million shares, valued at over £14 billion as of late June.The company's shares have reached unprecedented levels recently, driven by its achievements in artificial intelligence (AI).Following a £10 billion investment in OpenAI in early 2023, Microsoft's Azure emerged as the premier cloud computing service for developers seeking access to advanced AI models. The company has demonstrated exceptional performance, achieving 33% growth in its latest quarter. Additionally, Microsoft executives indicate that demand continues to exceed supply capacity, suggesting sustained growth prospects for the foreseeable future, the report said.Microsoft's enterprise software division has experienced significant growth through AI integration. The company's Microsoft 365 commercial segment has achieved substantial revenue increases, driven by expanded user base and enhanced pricing structures.The organisation has introduced specialised AI-driven assistants, known as Copilots, across various platforms including GitHub and Dynamics 365, enhancing business software functionality. Additionally, their Copilot Studio enables organisations to develop customised AI assistants using their proprietary data.These initiatives have resulted in robust revenue expansion and increased profitability through improved margins. With Azure's continued prominence in Microsoft's strategy, this positive trajectory is expected to continue.The Gates Foundation trust's investment portfolio largely mirrors the value-investing principles that brought success to Warren Buffett. Waste Management stands out as a prime example of this approach.Since 2002, Waste Management has remained a consistent component of the portfolio. This long-term investment has shown steady value appreciation over time, with minimal share disposals. At the conclusion of the first quarter, the trust maintained ownership of 32.2 million shares, currently valued at approximately £7.3 billion.The company's appeal lies in its substantial competitive advantage. Its unrivalled network of landfills creates a barrier that competitors cannot overcome, given the stringent permitting requirements for new facilities. This position enables Waste Management to generate revenue from smaller waste collection firms requiring access to its disposal sites. Additionally, its operational efficiency benefits from economies of scale, enabling optimised collection routes and enhanced operational performance. These factors contribute to the company's robust profit margins.The company's surplus funds have enabled its expansion through acquisitions, notably Stericycle, now operating as WM Healthcare Solutions. During the latest investor presentation, the leadership team projected £50 million in additional revenue through cross-selling with Stericycle, complementing the £250 million in operational efficiencies.The leadership anticipates yearly revenue expansion of approximately 9%, alongside improved EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation) margins through 2027. This financial performance will generate substantial free cash flow, enabling further strategic acquisitions, dividend increases, and share buybacks.The current enterprise value stands at roughly 15 times the projected EBITDA for the upcoming 12 months, suggesting reasonable valuation. This presents a viable investment option for those seeking dividend growth companies with robust free cash flow potential, the Motley Fool report added.","The investment portfolio of the Gates Foundation combines technological expertise and wisdom from a legendary investor's influence.

In a landmark development, the Group of Seven (G7) nations have agreed to exempt US-headquartered multinational corporations from key provisions of the global minimum tax agreement under a new ""side-by-side"" system.British businesses will also benefit from similar relief.As per news agency ANI, the new proposal, backed by the US and its G7 partners, will allow American firms to be taxed only domestically, on both foreign and local profits, rather than face additional top-up taxes overseas.The framework recognises existing US tax laws, specifically its domestic minimum tax, and offers a carve-out from the OECD’s Income Inclusion Rule (IIR) and Undertaxed Profits Rule (UTPR).The G7 announcement, released by Canada, which currently holds the rotating presidency, said the system was intended to “provide greater stability and certainty in the international tax system moving forward.”The breakthrough came after the United States dropped Section 899, a controversial clause in US President Donald Trump’s tax bill, which had proposed retaliatory taxes on foreign companies operating in the US.According to news agency Reuters, its removal paved the way for broader agreement and eased concerns in countries like the UK, where businesses feared exposure to punitive tax provisions.British finance minister Rachel Reeves welcomed the development and was quoted by Reuters as saying, “Today’s agreement provides much-needed certainty and stability for those businesses after they had raised their concerns.”Reeves also reaffirmed the UK’s continued efforts to combat aggressive tax avoidance globally.The move follows concerns raised earlier this year after Trump pulled the US out of the 2021 OECD-brokered global tax deal through an executive order. That landmark agreement, supported by nearly 140 countries under the Inclusive Framework, had aimed to ensure large multinational companies pay at least a 15% tax rate globally.According to news agency AFP, Trump also threatened retaliatory taxes on countries applying the global rules to US companies, a step that created apprehension among international investors.With the Section 899 provision now withdrawn, the new dual-track solution reflects a broader consensus among G7 nations to preserve tax sovereignty while maintaining progress on tackling base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS).The US Treasury said on X that this side-by-side approach would ""preserve important gains made by jurisdictions inside the Inclusive Framework"" and that it looks forward to developing this solution further through constructive discussions.The agreement now awaits further deliberation at the OECD level to determine how exemptions for US and UK firms will be formally recognised under the global tax regime.G7 leaders reiterated that the final solution must be ""acceptable and implementable to all.""","G7 nations have agreed to exempt US-headquartered multinational corporations from key provisions of the global minimum tax agreement under a new ""side-by- side"" system.

Starlink India: What’s next?

Security watch, spectrum talks shape Starlink’s rollout

Elon Musk-owned Starlink is poised to receive its final regulatory approval to launch satellite communication services in India, with space regulator IN-SPACe issuing a draft authorisation document for the company to sign. Once completed, the Indian National Space Promotion and Authorisation Centre will countersign the document, effectively clearing the way for Starlink to begin operations.The development will place Starlink on par with existing satcom players Eutelsat OneWeb and Jio Satellite, both of whom have already secured similar approvals. Starlink received its Global Mobile Personal Communication by Satellite (GMPCS) licence last month, becoming the third company in India permitted to offer satellite-based communication services, reported ET.Despite receiving the GMPCS licence and being close to final authorisation, Starlink must still fulfil critical operational and security requirements before launching commercial services in India. The company is now required to set up ground infrastructure, including satellite earth stations, communication gateways, and a control and monitoring centre within Indian territory.Following the installation of these systems, Starlink will have to demonstrate service functionality for security clearance, a mandatory step for all satcom operators.Without this security nod, companies are not permitted to commercially roll out services, even if they hold all necessary licences.Rivals OneWeb and Jio Satellite, which received their GMPCS permits in 2021 and 2022 respectively, are still awaiting security approval. Both companies were allocated trial spectrum by the department of telecommunications (DoT) last year to test their systems and demonstrate compliance. This trial allocation has now been extended by six months.Starlink’s progress will be closely watched by Indian security agencies, especially in light of earlier concerns. Authorities previously raised alarms over the unauthorised use of Starlink terminals in sensitive regions like the Northeast. The ministry of home affairs flagged the issue to the DoT in March this year, leading to increased scrutiny of the company’s operations and data-sharing practices.Under India’s satcom regulations, all traffic must be monitored within the country, pass through Indian gateways, and comply with local control protocols. Companies are also required to create buffer zones along international borders as part of the operational mandate.The DoT is expected to soon allocate a trial spectrum to Starlink to allow for demonstrations of its services and security compliance.India is simultaneously working on streamlining its satellite spectrum allocation policy. The telecom regulatory authority of India (TRAI) has recommended that satcom spectrum be assigned administratively for five years. The proposed fee is set at 4% of a provider’s adjusted gross revenue (AGR).For urban users, an additional charge of Rs 500 per subscriber annually is expected, while no such cost will be levied for rural users. Notably, there will be no upfront fee or allocation cost for satellite spectrum under these recommendations.In a sign of the government’s growing interest in satellite connectivity, communications minister Jyotiraditya Scindia recently met top SpaceX officials to discuss opportunities to use satellite technologies for expanding India’s digital infrastructure","Elon Musk-owned Starlink is poised to receive its final regulatory approval to launch satellite communication services in India.

US retirement age hits 67 by 2026: Early retirees to lose up to 30% in benefits- what it means for social security income,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-retirement-age-hits-67-by-2026-early-retirees-to-lose-up-to-30-in-benefits-what-it-means-for-social-security-income/articleshow/122126781.cms,"Representative image

Why the retirement age is increasing



T he full retirement age (FRA) for Social Security benefits in the United States will increase to 67 starting in 2026, affecting millions of Americans planning their retirement. Those opting to retire early at age 62 could see up to a 30 per cent reduction in monthly benefits.The change stems from reforms signed into law by former President Ronald Reagan in 1983 to address long-term financial challenges facing the Social Security system. The original Social Security Act, introduced by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1935, initially set the retirement age at 65.The FRA has been rising gradually since 1991, increasing by two months per year. It reached 66 in 1996 and will reach 67 in 2026 for individuals turning 65 that year and beyond.When the social security act was created, life expectancy in the US was just 61. By 1983, it had risen to over 74, and today it stands at 79. At the same time, the number of workers supporting each retiree has dropped, from 8.6 in 1955 to 2.8 in 2013, placing greater pressure on the system.The 1983 amendment was designed to address these demographic shifts and extend the program’s solvency.Many Americans claim benefits at age 62 due to financial need, health issues, or concerns about future cuts. However, doing so results in permanently reduced monthly payments. According to the Social Security Administration (SSA), claiming benefits at 62 can result in up to a 30 per cent decrease, while delaying retirement until age 70 can significantly increase monthly payouts.A recent report from the Social Security Board of Trustees warns that the Social Security Trust Funds will have enough revenue to pay full benefits only until 2034. After that, without Congressional action, only 81 per cent of scheduled benefits would be payable. This could reduce the average monthly cheque from $1,976 to about $1,600.In 2024, trust fund reserves fell by $67 billion to $2.72 trillion, as program costs continued to exceed income. The funds have been running a deficit since 2010, raising concerns about the long-term sustainability of social security.",The full retirement age (FRA) for Social Security benefits in the United States will increase to 67 starting in 2026. Those opting to retire early at age 62 could see up to a 30 per cent reduction in monthly benefits. The change stems from reforms signed into law by former President Ronald Reagan in 1983 to address long-term financial challenges facing the system.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122126821,imgsize-736075,width-400,resizemode-4/122126821.jpg"
"Liquidity surplus alone doesn’t boost broad credit growth, economic activity holds greater influence: StanChart report",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/liquidity-surplus-alone-doesnt-boost-broad-credit-growth-economic-activity-holds-greater-influence-stanchart-report/articleshow/122126052.cms,"Standard Chartered Bank (Image credits: IANS)

Credit growth in the economy is influenced more by overall economic activity than by the size of the liquidity surplus, according to a recent report by international bank Standard Chartered.The report said that while a high liquidity surplus may support growth in unsecured personal loans (excluding consumer durable loans), it does not necessarily lead to broad-based credit expansion.""Credit growth depends more on economic activity than the size of the liquidity surplus; however, unsecured personal loan growth (ex-consumer durables) could get a fillip on a large liquidity surplus,"" reported ANI quoting the report.It noted that credit growth, excluding unsecured personal and consumer durable loans, tends to slow down during times of excess liquidity. This points to real credit demand, which is closely tied to economic activity, being a stronger driver than the availability or cost of funds.The central banks often respond to slowing economic activity by increasing liquidity as a counter-cyclical measure. However, even with such efforts, overall credit (excluding unsecured personal and consumer durable loans) as a share of GDP has historically declined during times of high liquidity surplus.Citing one example, the report said that between December 2016 and September 2017, when liquidity surplus ranged between 2.6% and 3.3% of net demand and time liabilities (NDTL), credit (excluding unsecured personal and consumer durable loans) as a share of GDP fell from 48.9% to 46.2%. This downward trend continued until mid-2019.In contrast, unsecured personal loans (excluding consumer durables) have shown a strong upward trend over the past decade, with their share in GDP more than doubling to around 6%. This growth is driven by structural factors such as greater credit access and the rise of digital lending. However, the pace of expansion in this segment tends to pick up during periods of high liquidity.For instance, during March 2021 to March 2023, when liquidity conditions were relaxed, the share of unsecured personal loans in GDP rose faster than in previous similar periods, the report highlighted.","Credit growth depends more on economic activity than the size of the liquidity surplus. Unsecured personal loan growth (ex-consumer durables) could get a fillip on a large liquidity surplus, says Standard Chartered.

What each Buffett Family foundation supports: Causes and impact

The Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation focuses on reproductive health.

The Sherwood Foundation supports Nebraska-based nonprofits and early childhood education.

The Howard G Buffett Foundation works to address global hunger, human trafficking, and conflict resolution.

The NoVo Foundation advocates for marginalised girls, women and indigenous communities.

Billionaire investor Warren Buffett donated $6 billion worth of Berkshire Hathaway stock on Friday to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and four family-run charities. This marks his largest annual donation since he began giving away his fortune in 2006.The donation included about 12.36 million Class B shares of Berkshire Hathaway. Of that, 9.43 million shares went to the Gates Foundation, while 9,43,384 shares were donated to the Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation. Three other foundations, led by Buffett’s children Howard, Susie, and Peter, each received 660,366 shares. These are the Howard G Buffett Foundation, the Sherwood Foundation, and the NoVo Foundation.With this latest donation, Buffett’s total charitable giving has now exceeded $60 billion. Despite the large gift, he still owns 13.8% of Berkshire’s stock, as per Reuters.Before Friday’s donation, Buffett’s net worth was estimated at $152 billion, making him the fifth-richest person in the world, according to Forbes. Following the donation, he is expected to rank sixth. This gift surpasses the $5.3 billion he gave away in June last year, and the $1.14 billion he donated to family charities in November.In a statement, Buffett reaffirmed that he does not plan to sell any Berkshire shares. Now 94, he has led Omaha-based Berkshire Hathaway since 1965. The $1.05 trillion company owns nearly 200 businesses, including Geico and BNSF Railway, as well as large stakes in Apple and American Express.Last year, Buffett revised his will to leave 99.5% of his remaining fortune to a charitable trust after his death. The trust will be overseen by his three children, who will have about ten years to distribute the funds, and must decide together how the money is allocated. Buffett has previously said that donations to the Gates Foundation will stop after his death.","Warren Buffett donated $6 billion worth of Berkshire Hathaway stock on Friday to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and four family-run charities.

As of 12:13 p.m. Eastern, the S&P 500 was up 0.7% and the Nasdaq 0.6%, AP reported.Nike led market gains with an 18.5% jump, despite warning of a $1 billion tariff impact and announcing “surgical” price hikes in the US starting this fall. Other consumer and industrial stocks also advanced, buoyed by easing tensions in the Middle East and signs of progress in US-China trade talks.US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Friday that a new trade deal will ease access to rare earth materials critical for manufacturing. China's Commerce Ministry also said both sides had ""confirmed the details of the framework"" for talks, though it did not specifically mention rare earths access.Meanwhile, a ceasefire between Israel and Iran remained in effect, helping stabilise oil prices. US crude held flat, retreating to pre-conflict levels.Inflation continues to shadow market optimism. On Friday, the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge—the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index—rose to 2.3% in May, up from 2.1% in April and still above the central bank’s 2% target. Analysts warn that more pronounced inflationary effects from tariffs could emerge in the coming months.""While we also would have expected to already be seeing a bit more pass through into the inflation statistics, we still expect these impacts to show up in a more meaningful way in the next few months,"" said Greg Wilensky, head of US fixed income at Janus Henderson, quoted AP.The Fed has not cut rates in 2025 so far, maintaining caution amid lingering concerns that tariffs could reignite price pressures. Economists still anticipate two cuts before year-end.Bond yields were little changed, with the 10-year Treasury yield ticking up to 4.25% and the two-year note at 3.73%.Stocks in Europe were mostly higher, with investors tracking the US rally and global trade developments.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume.

Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran Udaan until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.Udaan built an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business still accounts for a very small part of India’s overall retail market but can balloon to $150 billion in sales and yield a 100% return on capital invested in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co. estimates published in the Mint newspaper.Bengaluru-based Udaan has also ventured into financing through its fintech unit which helps shopkeepers get working capital loans to buy inventory. That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says.

How India's GDP has been growing

What SBI report said on savings and investment

Incremental capital output ratio

NEW DELHI: India's gross domestic product (GDP) data for the third quarter (October-December 2022) received a word of caution from the former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan In an interview with news agency PTI, Rajan that India is ""dangerously close"" to the Hindu rate of growth in view of subdued private sector investment, high interest rates and slowing global growth.India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying"".However, a report released by the State Bank of India (SBI) economists on Tuesday dismissed arguments that India is dangerously close to Hindu rate of growth saying such statements are ""ill-conceived, biased and premature"".The term 'Hindu growth rate' was coined by late economist Raj Krishna in 1978 to describe the slow growth in the country.It basically refers to the low pace of economic growth rates during 1950s to 1980s. During this period, the Indian economy averaged 3.5%.A former lecturer at the Delhi School of Economics (DSE), Krishna noted that only if the rate of growth is persistently slow and accompanied by low per-capita GDP, then it will be known as Hindu rate of growth but it has to factor in population growth as well.Before economic reforms of 1991, India's economic growth remained stagnant and low, while per capita income averaged around 1.3%. Krishna termed this low growth situation to be a result of socialist policies of state control and import substitution.However, the economic situation changed when liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation (LPG) reforms came into effect in the year 1991, at a time when India faced balance of payment crisis.Over the years, many economists have strongly opposed the idea of 'Hindu growth rate' and the term never had universal acceptance.The Indian economy plunged into its very first technical recession in FY21 due to the impact of Covid-19 pandemic and the related nationwide lockdowns. GDP shrunk by an unprecedented 23.8% in the first quarter of the financial year 2020-21. However, due to spurt in economic activities in the subsequent quarters, the GDP decline started to narrow.However, if we look at the period before Covid-19 as well, India's growth curve shows a declining trend.From 8.26% in FY17, GDP growth plunged to 3.74% in FY20. Shutdown of economic activities in FY21 in wake of Covid-19 only made matters worse.As lockdowns started to ease and business activities resumed, India's GDP also started rising. In Q1 of FY22, growth jumped to 20.1% mainly on account of low base effect. By the fourth quarter of FY22, growth came down to 4.10%.Similarly, the new financial year 2022-23 brought fresh economic challenges in the form of Russia-Ukraine war that impacted almost all major economies of the world, slowed the pace of growth, pushed inflation to record highs.As a result, the central banks of all advanced economies spurred into action and opted for monetary policy tightening to curb the soaring inflation.With persistently rising interest rates, India's economy grew by 4.4% in Q3 of FY23, as the Centre revised upwards GDP growth for previous year to 9.10% from 8.7% earlier.The report weighed recent GDP numbers against the available data on savings and investments for the past decade and highlighted some interesting points.""Quarterly growth numbers are noisy and should be best avoided for any serious interpretation (on an average, India's GDP growth has witnessed Rs 2 lakh crore upward revision for the 3 year ended FY23),"" the report said.Gross capital formation (GCF) by the government touched a high of 11.8% in 2021-22, up from 10.7% in 2020-21.""This also had a domino effect on private sector investment that jumped from 10 per cent to 10.8% over the same period,"" it said.In fact, Ecowrap added that the trends in GCF to gross output ratio or the plough back of funds for creation of fresh capacity shows that for public administration the ratio attained fresh peak in 2021-22 owing to the emphasis on capital expenditure in recent budgets.At the aggregate level, gross capital formation is supposed to have crossed 32% in 2022-23, the highest level since 2018-19.According to the report, in 2021-22, gross savings have risen to 30% from 29% in 2020-21.""The ratio is supposed to have crossed 31 per cent in 2022-23, the highest since 2018-19. The household savings increased sharply during the pandemic period on account of sharp accretion in financial savings such as deposits,"" said the report by SBI's Economic Research Department.While household financial savings have since then moderated from 15.4% in 2020-21 to 11.1% in 2022-23, savings in physical assets have grown sharply to 11.8% in 2021-22 from 10.7% in 2020-21.The report further analysed Incremental Capital Output ratio (ICOR) -- which measures additional units of capital (investment) needed to produce additional units of output. It said that the ratio has been improving.""ICOR which was 7.5 in FY 12 is now only 3.5 in FY22. Clearly, only half of capital is now needed for next unit of output,"" the report noted.Such reducing ICOR in the current years reflects a relatively increasing efficiency of capital and shows that the economy is on a sound footing, the report said.""From that point of view, future GDP growth rates even at 7% could still mean a decent number by any standards!,"" it added.","India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.

An employee is entitled for a 50 per cent amount of the last drawn salary as pension.OPS was discontinued by the NDA government in 2003 with effect from April 1, 2004.Under the new pension scheme (NPS), employees contribute 10 per cent of their basic salary towards pension while the government contributes 14 per cent.Governments of Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand have informed the central government/ Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA about their decision to restart OPS for their employees.The government of Punjab on November 18, 2022, issued a notification regarding implementation of OPS for the state government employees who are being covered under NPS. Jharkhand too has decided to revert to OPS.",Former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan has expressed his concern over the decision of some states to restart the old pension scheme.

The meeting was chaired by Food Secretary Sanjeev Chopra.Out of the total wheat procurement target for the 2022-23 marketing year (April-March), Punjab will aim to procure 2.5 million tonnes wheat, Haryana 1.5 million tonnes and Madhya Pradrsh 2 million tonnes, the food ministry said in a statement.Wheat procurement had declined last year due to a fall in domestic production and higher exports.However, the government has projected a record wheat production at 112.18 million tonnes in the 2023-24 crop year (July-June) as per the second estimate of the agriculture ministry.Besides wheat, the government has also fixed rabi (winter) rice procurement target at 10.6 million tonnes in the 2022-23 marketing year.States have been advised to enhance rice milling capacity so that milling of one season gets completed before the commencement of next season and recycling of rice may be avoided.Whereas procurement of millets and coarse grains is estimated to be 7,50,000 tonnes this year, higher than 6,30,000 tonnes in 2021-22.

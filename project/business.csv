Gold price prediction today:Gold and silver prices soared to fresh highs last week, with gold marking an all-time high on both COMEX and the domestic front, while silver reached its highest level on COMEX since 2011. The rally was fueled by a combination of increasing expectations of a US Federal Reserve rate cut in September, currently priced at around 85%, and rising geopolitical tensions including the Israel-Gaza conflict and renewed tariff escalations.A weaker rupee, which hit a record low against the US dollar, further supported domestic bullion prices. US economic data showed resilience, with solid consumer spending and a 0.2% monthly rise in the PCE price index; however, persistent inflation and political pressure from President Trump on the Fed are reinforcing market expectations of an imminent rate cut. Fed Chair Powell’s dovish remarks at Jackson Hole suggested that a policy shift is likely, though uncertainty remains.Meanwhile, ETF inflows, increased premiums in China, and festive demand in India added fundamental support to the price rally. Geopolitical uncertainty was also heightened by Trump’s controversial push to remove Fed Governor Lisa Cook, raising concerns over central bank independence.On the trade front, ongoing US talks and legal challenges to Trump-era tariffs kept market participants cautious.Looking ahead, updates from the trilateral meeting between Prime Minister Modi and leaders of China and Russia over the weekend, as well as potential updates on the US-India trade deal, both of which could introduce fresh volatility in bullion and currency markets.We are starting this week with a US holiday, on the back of labour day, volatility is expected to remain high. Along with the geo-political update which could continue to induce further momentum in prices, economic data scheduled this week could also trigger higher swings in prices.US jobs market data i.e. US private payrolls, non-farm payroll, JOLTS and weekly jobless claims will be important to keep an eye on. This will be enough to provide clarity on the US labour market and could also influence the interest rate cut probabilities for meetings to come in this year. Also, PMI numbers from major economies will be important to keep an eye on.","Gold and silver prices soared to fresh highs last week, with gold marking an all-time high on both COMEX and the domestic front.

Stock market recommendations:In August, Nifty moved within a narrow band of 816 points — its tightest monthly range since March 2024 — despite elevated volatility. The index reflected a tug-of-war between supportive domestic developments and persistent global uncertainties. Sentiment saw a mid-month boost following S&P’s upgrade of India’s outlook and Prime Minister Modi’s announcement on GST reforms.However, this optimism proved short-lived. In the final stretch of the month, Nifty reversed sharply, losing over 700 points in just six trading sessions. The sell-off was primarily driven by rising tariff tensions between the US and India.Eventually, the index settled near the 24400 mark, registering a monthly decline of 1.38%. This marked the second straight month of negative returns, highlighting continued selling pressure and the lack of follow-through buying.From a technical standpoint, Nifty now trades below its 20-day, 50-day, and 100-day EMAs — all of which are sloping downward, indicating weakening momentum in the short to medium term. Adding to the cautious outlook, the daily RSI has dropped below the 40 level and remains in a declining trend, which is a bearish signal.Looking ahead, the 200-day EMA zone of 24300–24250 has emerged as a critical support area. A sustained breach below 24250 could intensify the downside, potentially dragging the index toward the 24000 mark. On the flip side, the resistance zone of 24650–24700 will be key; only a decisive breakout above this range could revive bullish sentiment and open the door for a recovery.Bank Nifty witnessed a steep decline in August, falling nearly 4% and forming a large bearish candle on the monthly chart. This weakness comes on the heels of a Dark Cloud Cover candlestick pattern seen in July, which has now been confirmed by the August correction — reinforcing the bearish outlook on a broader timeframe.The index has been consistently lagging behind the frontline indices in recent weeks. This relative underperformance is clearly reflected in the Bank Nifty vs Nifty ratio chart, which has dropped to a 100-day low — a sign of sustained weakness. After hitting a swing high of 56156, the index has plunged over 2400 points in just nine trading sessions, underscoring the severity of the decline.This correction has dragged the index below its 20-day, 50-day, and 100-day EMAs, all of which have started to slope downward — a bearish technical signal. The daily RSI remains in negative territory and continues to decline, while the MACD stays bearish, trading below both its signal line and the zero line.Looking ahead, the 200-day EMA zone of 53600–53500 has emerged as a key support area. A sustained move below 53500 could open the door for further downside toward 52900, followed by 52400 in the near term. On the upside, the resistance zone of 54500–54600 will be crucial; only a decisive breakout above this range could signal a potential recovery.The stock has registered a breakout from a falling channel pattern on Friday, ending a prolonged phase of consolidation that lasted 72 trading sessions. This breakout is particularly significant as it is accompanied by strong volume, lending credibility to the move and indicating renewed buying interest. In addition to the pattern breakout, the stock has also surged above its key short-term and long-term moving averages, reinforcing the bullish shift in trend.This crossover suggests that the stock may now be entering a new upward trajectory after weeks of range-bound movement.Notably, the daily RSI has climbed above the 60 mark for the first time since June 2025, signalling a momentum shift and strengthening the bullish case. This RSI breakout from a subdued zone further supports the possibility of sustained upside in the near term. Hence, we recommend to accumulate the stock in the zone of 700-690 level with a stoploss of Rs 670 level. On the upside, it is likely to test the level of 750 in the short term.The stock formed a Shooting Star candlestick pattern on August 01, which triggered a subsequent correction. This pullback found support near the 50-day EMA, from where the stock has resumed its upward trajectory. Notably, it continues to outperform the broader market, as reflected in the ratio chart against the Nifty 500, which has already broken out of a consolidation phase on the daily timeframe.Currently, the stock is on the verge of a horizontal trendline breakout, further strengthening its bullish setup. Trading at an all-time high, all key moving averages and momentum indicators are aligned positively. The daily RSI has surged past the 60 mark and remains in an upward trend, reinforcing the strong bullish momentum.Hence, we recommend to accumulate the stock in the zone of 755-750 level with a stoploss of Rs 720 level. On the upside, it is likely to test the level of 820 in the short term.","According to Sudeep Shah, Head - Technical Research and Derivatives, SBI Securities, the top stock picks for this week are CG Power and Industrial Solutions Ltd, and Syrma SGS Technology Ltd.

"Day of records: Rupee logs fresh low, gold & silver at new high",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/day-of-records-rupee-logs-fresh-low-gold-silver-at-new-high/articleshow/123644639.cms,"



MUMBAI: The ongoing US-India tariff-related issues took its toll on the rupee on Monday, sending it to a record low level of 88.33 per dollar. In the bullion market, the increasing chances of a cut in interest rates in the US revived the rally in precious metals globally. Combined with the weakness of the rupee, gold and silver prices both were at new life-high levels in the domestic market during the day.On Monday, the rupee slipped to 88.33 to a dollar intraday but recovered to close at 88.2, unchanged from its previous close. The currency ended Aug with a 0.7% decline, marking its fourth consecutive monthly fall.Year-to-date, the rupee has weakened around 3%, making it the worst-performing Asian currency. The slide has been driven by concerns over higher US tariffs on Indian goods, which threaten to erode export competitiveness and weigh on growth. The continuous selling by foreign investors, who have net sold stocks worth nearly Rs 40,000 crore since Aug 1, have also been weighing on the rupee's strength against peers.Some traders believe that the central bank has let the rupee slide given the pressures on the trade front due to tariffs.Importers are also staying away as there is uncertainty on the trade front as well.Economists warn that persistent outflows and weaker exports could hurt corporate earnings, the trade balance, and the broader growth outlook. In the bullion market, gold and silver were on streak, following global market rallies.On Monday, on MCX, the gold futures for Oct delivery - the most-traded contracts - almost hit Rs 1.06 lakh/10gm mark, a new all-time high. On the same exchange, silver futures for Dec delivery, the most traded contracts, were almost within striking distance of Rs 1.25 lakh/kg level. In the international market, gold was trading at around $3,500/ounce, a new all-time high. And silver was trading above the $41.5/Oz mark, a level not seen in more than 14 years.According to analysts, in addition to expectations of a rate cut in the US, globally investors are also worried about the US central bank losing its autonomy, leading to weakness of the greenback. ""Demand for safe havens has increased as a result of Trump's historic attempt to oust a Fed governor, which has sparked worries about the loss of central bank's authority,"" said Renisha Chainani of Augmont, a bullion trading & research firm.A weak dollar leads to fall in prices of gold and silver (since both are dollar-denominated) in terms of other major currencies. This in turn could lead to higher demand for gold and silver.","The rupee slipped to 88.33 to a dollar intraday but recovered to close at 88.2.

India's US Treasury bills holdings down





US Treasury bills seem to be losing favour, with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) stepping up gold holdings to increase India’s foreign exchange reserves. India's central bank has shown a preference for increasing gold reserves instead of US Treasury bills to strengthen its foreign exchange holdings, according to recent data from the US Department of Treasury and RBI. This is part of a broader global shift towards diversifying national reserves beyond dollar-based assets.The quantity of gold within foreign exchange reserves reached 879.98 metric tonnes as of June 27, 2025, rising from 840.76 metric tonnes recorded on June 28, 2024.According to an ET report, data reveals a decline in India's US T-bill investments in June compared to the previous year, whilst its gold reserves increased during this period.Nevertheless, India maintains its position among the top 20 investors in US T-bills, surpassing Saudi Arabia and Germany. Its holdings were valued at $227 billion in June 2025, down from $242 billion in June last year.The declining share of dollar holdings indicates a widespread international trend towards diversifying foreign exchange reserves, driven by geopolitical tensions and trade disputes.""Indian reserves have witnessed progressively a higher buildup of gold reserves which has been accompanied by diversification in forex currency assets,"" said Madan Sabnavis, chief economist at Bank of Baroda.""This is why some countries, especially India, China, and Brazil, have seen swings here. The outstanding stock of T-bills reflects dollar valuation amid volatility in the greenback witnessed in the last twelve months.""According to RBI statistics, it acquired roughly 39.22 metric tonnes of gold within this timeframe.""India's holdings of UST reduced by $14.5 billion over one year, despite a decline in UST yields, indicating that there has been a diversification of forex reserve holdings away from UST,"" said Gaura Sengupta, economist at IDFC First Bank, according to the ET report.""Over the same period, there has been a rise in gold reserve holdings. This shift reflects an effort to diversify forex reserves and reduce the risk of revaluation loss due to US-specific factors. For instance, worsening fiscal metrics of the US government have kept yields elevated.""India's US T-bills holdings reached a minimum in December, before Donald Trump's assumption of office. The majority of the $227 billion T-bills constitute part of the foreign exchange reserves, which amounted to $690 billion as of August 22, 2025.Following Japan and the UK, China ranks as the third-largest US T-bills holder and has decreased its position. Mainland China's holdings stood at $756 billion in June 2025, reduced from $780 billion in June 2024. In contrast, Israel significantly expanded its investments in this category during this timeframe.","Data reveals a decline in India's US T-bill investments in June compared to the previous year, whilst its gold reserves increased during this period.

GST collections August 2025: The Goods and Services Tax GST ) collections reached Rs 1.86 lakh crore in August, showing a 6.5% increase compared to August of the previous year, according to official government figures released on Monday.The country's gross GST collections amounted to Rs 1.96 lakh crore in the preceding month. The GST collections peaked at Rs 2.37 lakh crore in April 2025, marking the highest revenue collection since its implementation.Abhishek Jain, Indirect Tax Head & Partner, KPMG says, “Broadly, collections have been aligned with the past couple of months, though refund disbursals have seen some reduction. What will be interesting to watch is the impact on collections in the coming months, particularly with the anticipated rate rejig and certain revenue streams stalling, such as those from online real-money gaming.”Gross GST revenue hit an all-time high of Rs 22.08 lakh crore during the 2024-25 financial year, doubling from Rs 11.37 lakh crore in FY21 over a five-year period.In FY25, the average monthly collections rose to Rs 1.84 lakh crore, showing considerable growth from Rs 1.68 lakh crore in FY24 and Rs 1.51 lakh crore in FY22.The GST framework has experienced significant growth in its taxpayer registration, expanding from 65 lakh taxpayers in 2017 to over 1.51 crore across an eight-year duration.The 2024-25 fiscal year recorded the highest-ever gross goods and services tax collections at Rs 22.08 lakh crore, registering a 9.4 per cent increase compared to the preceding financial year.PM Narendra Modi announced GST reforms and rate cuts in his Independence Day speech this year, calling it a “Diwali gift”. The government has proposed GST 2.0, featuring two primary tax rates: 5% for everyday items and 18% for other products, aiming to simplify taxation for the public and enterprises.The comprehensive restructuring proposal, suggests eliminating the 12% and 28% brackets, concluding the compensation cess before March, whilst imposing 40% tax on harmful products.Essential items including food, medicines, medical equipment, educational materials and daily necessities such as hair oil and toothbrush would attract nil or 5% tax, according to officials. Middle-class consumer goods like ""ACs, TV sets and refrigerators"" would shift to the 18% category, though the taxation approach for automobiles and cement, currently taxed at 28%, remains unclear.The proposal also includes a significant reduction in GST rates for health and term insurance policies, an amendment that has been under consideration for several months.","Gross GST revenue hit an all-time high of Rs 22.08 lakh crore during the 2024-25 financial year.

Julia Stewart thought she had done everything right. As president of Applebee’s, she built what she calls a “pretty remarkable” team, doubled the stock price, and put the struggling restaurant chain back on its feet.Confident in her record, she approached the CEO’s office expecting the top job. Instead, she got a blunt “No. Not ever.”That moment, Stewart says, became the turning point of her career.Speaking on the Matthews Mentality Podcast in April 2025, the now–CEO of DineEquity Inc. recalled how the rejection fueled her next big move.“I thought he meant, ‘No, not today,’” Stewart said of the conversation. “But he said, ‘No, not ever.’”The blow was personal. But it didn’t break her. Stewart left Applebee’s and joined IHOP, where she spent five years reviving the brand’s image and performance.Then came the full-circle moment.Stewart led IHOP’s $2.3 billion acquisition of Applebee’s, bringing the chain that once rejected her under her control. “Now, obviously, ultimately, you don’t borrow $2.3 billion for revenge. You just don’t do that. But we did borrow $2.3 billion.We did buy Applebee’s,” she said.One of her first calls? Informing the former Applebee’s CEO, the same one who had denied her the top role, that his services were no longer required.Looking back, Stewart described her business style after that defining chapter: “I became a stone-cold killer.”Her story has since become a corporate legend, proof that sometimes the harshest rejection sets the stage for the most powerful comeback.","Julia Stewart was denied the top job at Applebee's.

The India-UK Free Trade Agreement (FTA) signed on July 24 by Prime Ministers Narendra Modi and Keir Starmer will cut trade tariffs from 15% to 3% and is expected to bolster business confidence in a volatile global environment, British MPs were told on Monday.UK Business and Trade Secretary Jonathan Reynolds briefed the House of Commons on the pre-ratification process for the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA), highlighting its potential impact ahead of full implementation, PTI reported.“This agreement drops the average Indian tariff on UK products from 15% to 3%, with duties falling by around £400 million at entry, rising to £900 million after staging,” Reynolds said. “It is expected to increase bilateral trade by £25.5 billion, raise UK GDP by £4.8 billion, and boost wages by £2.2 billion annually. In an increasingly unstable world, this deal provides businesses with confidence as they grow and expand. ”The FTA secures preferential access to India’s federal procurement market, guarantees opportunities for UK service suppliers, and simplifies trade through improved customs and digital processes, Reynolds added.Specific regional gains include £190 million for the West Midlands and Scotland and £210 million for the North West, supporting the UK’s high-growth sectors.Reynolds also informed MPs about the commissioning of the Trade and Agriculture Commission, the Food Standards Agency, and Food Standards Scotland, whose reports under Section 42 of the Agriculture Act 2020 are needed before Parliament can ratify the agreement.Parallel negotiations on the Double Contribution Convention, agreed alongside the FTA to prevent temporary foreign workers from duplicating social security contributions, will also follow the standard parliamentary process.The India-UK CETA, signed during Modi’s UK visit, aims to double bilateral trade to $120 billion by 2030. While implementation in India requires only Cabinet approval, ratification in the UK is expected to take up to a year.

China announced that the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) will be setting up a Development Bank, a major forward after a decade of discussions among member states.Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi on Monday said the decision was finally approved, calling it a move that would boost efficiency and social development in the region.He said the SCO would begin this important process, creating another multilateral platform in the EuroAsian region. He also added that it was something to celebrate not just for the member states but for the whole region.Although Wang confirmed the decision, he gave no timeline for when the new bank would be established.The proposal had been strongly backed by China for years, with President Xi Jinping earlier urging SCO nations to accelerate the process, PTI reported.In his inaugural address, Xi said the creation of the bank was crucial, given the growing appeal of the 10-nation bloc.China has been pushing for a bank modelled on the New Development Bank (NDB) of the BRICS grouping and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), both of which are based in China.India is the second-largest shareholder in the AIIB.Initially viewed as rivals to the IMF, World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, both banks now work alongside them through co-financing arrangements.Wang also announced that the SCO has approved the admission of Laos as a new partner. At the same time, observer states and dialogue partners will be merged into a single category, the SCO partner, to improve efficiency.“The SCO has an extended family of 27,” Wang said, as quoted by PTI.Founded in 2001 in Shanghai, the SCO now consists of Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, China, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, India, Pakistan, Iran and Belarus. Afghanistan and Mongolia are observer states, with 14 other countries serving as dialogue partners.The summit also saw the launch of four new security centres: the SCO universal centre for countering security challenges and threats, the information security centre, the centre combating transnational crimes, and the SCO anti-drug centre.He added that three new cooperation centres will also be set up for China-SCO collaboration in energy, green industry and the digital economy.At the SCO Plus meeting, Xi proposed a Global Governance Initiative (GGI), adding to China’s earlier foreign policy frameworks: the Global Development Initiative (GDI), the Global Security Initiative (GSI) and the Global Cultural Initiative (GCI).",Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi on Monday said the decision was finally approved.

China and India dominate Russia oil imports





US President Donald Trump has again slammed India for its continued purchase of crude oil and arms from Russia. In a Truth Social post on Monday, Trump said, “India buys most of its oil and military products from Russia, very little from the US. ”The US has imposed a 25% additional tariff on India for its crude oil trade with Russia, accusing India of indirectly financing the war with Ukraine. But, the interesting thing to note is that both America and the European Union continue to do trade worth billions of dollars with Russia, albeit significantly reduced compared to pre-war levels.Indeed, Russian President Vladimir Putin during his visit to Alaska for a meeting with Trump noted that trade with the US has jumped 20%!as confirmed by data from the US Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) and Census Bureau quoted in a CNN report.Also Read | ‘Modi’s war’? How US, EU are 'fuelling', funding Russia-Ukraine conflict , according to the bloc's statistical agency.According to the CNN report quoting US Census Bureau statistics data, the United States received fertiliser imports valued at $927 million during January-June this year. Russian fertiliser imports to the US exceeded $1 billion last year.""Unless the US sanctions Russian fertilizer imports, as it does with Belarusian potash, this (level of trade) is likely to continue,"" Allan Pickett, head of fertilizer analysis at S&P Global Commodity Insights was quoted as saying by CNN. ""Russia remains one of the most important global fertilizer suppliers and the influence of it has not diminished since 2022.""""Urea and potash could be readily sourced from elsewhere, although with potash it would further increase US dependence on Canada, which currently has an interesting trade dynamic,"" Pickett added.Whilst palladium imports from Russia have decreased notably since 2021, the US imported $878 million worth in 2024 and $594 million worth through June 2025. This silvery metal is essential for electronic and industrial products, particularly in vehicle catalytic converters.Uranium and plutonium imports from Russia to the US reached $755 million in the first half of this year, according to Census data. The previous year's imports of these nuclear materials from Russia totalled $624 million.Russia's position as the EU's primary petroleum supplier changed following its war with Ukraine. Maritime Russian oil and refined products imports faced EU restrictions, causing a significant decline to $1.72 billion in the first quarter of 2025, compared to $16.4 billion in the same period of 2021, as per Eurostat figures quoted in the CNN report.According to the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air's analysis, in July 2025, Hungary, France, Slovakia, Belgium and Spain emerged as the principal European importers of Russian fossil fuels. Hungary and Slovakia dominated crude oil imports, whilst others primarily imported liquefied natural gas.Natural gas imports from Russia showed an increase in value over four years due to price rises, reaching $5.23 billion in 2025's first quarter, according to Eurostat. The EU reduced Russia's share in liquefied natural gas imports from 22% to 19% between 2021 and 2025, whilst increasing American imports substantially.Russian iron and steel imports to the EU decreased considerably. First quarter 2025 figures showed imports worth $850 million, approximately half the value from the same period in 2021, as Eurostat reports.Fertiliser imports from Russia remained relatively stable since 2021, unaffected by sanctions and import duties. EU nations imported Russian fertiliser worth $640 million in 2025's first quarter.The EU diversified its nickel sourcing, increasing imports from the United States, Norway, the United Kingdom and Canada. Nevertheless, Russian nickel imports totalled $300 million in the first quarter of 2025. Nickel serves primarily in stainless steel, alloy steel and battery production.While the EU's trade with Russia has reduced, it is important to note that it has not stopped.Also Read | 'Social Truth' vs data: What Trump doesn’t get about India’s 'dead' economy India's trade with Russia has seen a dramatic surge, with imports reaching $67 billion in 2024, as per United Nations data. The majority, approximately $53 billion, consisted of petroleum oils and crude oil. This marks a significant increase from 2021's figure of $8.7 billion in total imports before the conflict began.According to Vortexa, an energy data firm, Russian oil currently dominates India's market with a 36% share, establishing Russia as India's primary crude oil supplier. This substantial growth in oil and gas imports occurred following the commencement of hostilities.Similarly, China increased its Russian crude oil purchases after 2022, taking advantage of reduced prices resulting from Western nations curtailing their Russian fuel imports. Vortexa data indicates that Russian oil comprises 13.5% of China's crude imports. UN-aggregated figures show China's total Russian imports reached $130 billion in 2024, with petroleum oils and crude accounting for $62.6 billion.Both India and China have maintained that the source of crude oil procurement is a matter of strategic autonomy.In response to Trump’s additional 25% tariffs on India for its crude oil trade with Russia, the ministry of external affairs has said, “The United States has in recent days targeted India’s oil imports from Russia. We have already made clear our position on these issues, including the fact that our imports are based on market factors and done with the overall objective of ensuring the energy security of 1.4 billion people of India. It is therefore extremely unfortunate that the US should choose to impose additional tariffs on India for actions that several other countries are also taking in their own national interest.

"SCO meet: How Modi, Putin, Xi flipped Trump’s tariff gambit",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/sco-meet-how-modi-putin-xi-flipped-trumps-tariff-gambit-reverse-nixon/articleshow/123638028.cms,"Shehbaz Sharif Left Awkward As Modi and Putin Walk Past Him During SCO Summit

“The Nixon paradigm did work in reverse, but differently from what the US had thought; that is, Moscow played Washington this time,” said Francesco Sisci, Director at the Appia Institute.

Why it matters

The optics and sequence matter. Trump aimed to repeat Nixon’s 1972 diplomatic masterstroke - opening China to isolate the USSR. In today’s reversed context, Trump sought to lure Russia away from China to break the tightening autocratic alliance that challenges US primacy.

Instead, Putin may have pulled the ultimate diplomatic jiu-jitsu: using the US initiative as leverage to tighten his grip on both China and India, positioning Russia as the pivot between the world’s three most powerful non-Western nations.

“If Trump and Xi wind up competing for Putin’s attention, the Russian leader could play the US and China off each other, to his own benefit,” Bonnie Glaser of the German Marshall Fund told Atlantic.

The result could fracture not only US-India ties, but the broader Western alliance network painstakingly built since the Cold War.

Nixon’s legacy, reversed?

“The one thing you never want to happen is… Russia and China uniting,” Trump said in October. “I’m going to have to un-unite them, and I think I can do that.”

Zoom in: India’s pivot - or power play?

“Even in the most difficult situations, India and Russia have always walked shoulder to shoulder,” Modi said in Tianjin. “Our Special and Privileged Strategic Partnership remains a vital pillar of regional and global stability.”

The bottom line





On the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit in China's Tianjin, leaders from India, China, and Russia projected an image of warmth and strategic convergence that is bound to rattle Washington. Prime Minister Narendra Modi called Russia a “special and privileged partner.” Chinese President Xi Jinping declared that “the world’s two most populous countries need to be friends.” And Russian President Vladimir Putin clasped Modi’s hand, addressed him as “dear friend,” and whisked him away in his armoured Aurus limousine.The optics told a story of deepening chemistry: Xi and Modi smiling together after years of tension, Modi leaning into Moscow even as Trump slapped tariffs on Indian goods, and Putin positioning himself as the indispensable broker of this triangular courtship.At Tianjin, Russian President Putin may have executed a geopolitical manoeuvre that turns US Cold War strategy on its head - a “Reverse Nixon” - not by peeling away China, but by deepening his ties with both Beijing and New Delhi, at the expense of US President Donald Trump and American influence.The move was subtle but seismic. While Trump met Putin in Alaska on August 15 to persuade him to drift from China's orbit, Beijing welcomed PM Modi just two weeks later.On August 30, Modi was in Beijing. The next day, he stood smiling next to Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping at the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit in Tianjin - a public relations coup for Beijing and Moscow.In 1972, then US President Richard Nixon’s bold gamble to meet Chinese leader Mao Zedong shifted the Cold War balance. It exploited the Sino-Soviet split, reoriented the global chessboard, and paved the way for China’s eventual market reforms. Today, Trump seeks to flip that strategy - to drive a wedge between Russia and China.On paper, the logic works. As Marco Rubio warned, letting Russia become “a permanent junior partner to China” creates a two-headed nuclear-armed threat. But the execution is where Trump’s strategy unravelled.It seems that the weakest link in Trump’s plan wasn’t Russia or China. It was India. For over two decades, successive US administrations-Democratic and Republican-have painstakingly cultivated ties with New Delhi. Trump, in a single month, may have undone much of that progress.According to a report in the New York Times, the final straw for PM Modi wasn’t tariffs or oil sanctions. It was a phone call. Trump reportedly pressed Modi to nominate him for the Nobel Peace Prize, claiming his efforts to mediate between India and Pakistan deserved global recognition. The ask was seen in New Delhi as not only tone-deaf, but borderline insulting.PM Modi responded with actions, not words. Time and again, he has talked about India’s multi-alignment strategy. The series of meetings and conversations - Xi, Putin, a call to Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskyy - sent a clear signal: New Delhi is not lining up behind Washington, especially if it’s led by an unpredictable partner.At the same summit, Modi and Putin took a private ride in Putin’s armored Aurus limousine - a symbolic show of closeness. Russia and India aim to boost bilateral trade to $100 billion by 2030. For now, Russia supplies nearly 37% of India’s oil imports - a staggering increase from just a few years ago.India may still walk a middle path - but its sudden warmth toward Beijing and Moscow complicates US strategy across the Indo-Pacific. Quad unity is fraying, and US tariffs (now 50%) on Indian goods haven’t helped.“India can return happily to having the Russian cake and eating the American pie,” said Sreeram Sundar Chaulia of Jindal School of International Affairs. But only if Washington reestablishes trust.Putin didn’t break with Xi - he broke the illusion that Trump could drive a wedge between America’s rivals. In trying to execute a Nixonian pivot, Trump misjudged the players, misread the timing, and underestimated how much his erratic behavior would cost.Rather than weakening America’s adversaries, he has made Russia the pivot power, emboldened Xi, and pushed India into recalibration mode.For all the talk of multipolarity and realignment, one fact remains: the US cannot afford to lose India. Nor can it afford to hand Putin the strategic initiative.If America cannot restore trust with New Delhi-and fast-it risks unraveling the post-WWII alliance structure that has held global instability in check. And unlike Nixon, who reshaped history by reading his adversaries correctly, Trump may be reshaping it by misreading the moment entirely.(With inputs from agencies)","In 1972, then US President Richard Nixon’s bold gamble to meet Chinese leader Mao Zedong shifted the Cold War balance.

‘Without Tariffs...': Trump's Fresh Rant After Putin, Modi, Xi Unite At SCO Amid U.S Trade Tantrums





US President Donald Trump’s plan to impose steep import taxes on pharmaceuticals — some as high as 200% — is drawing sharp warnings from industry experts who fear it could push up drug prices in the United States and trigger shortages, according to an AP report.Trump, who has already levied tariffs on products ranging from autos to steel, now wants to extend them to medicines — a sector that for decades has mostly entered the US duty-free. A recent trade deal with Europe has already set a 15% tariff on certain drugs, and the president has threatened far higher duties on imports from elsewhere.“Shock and awe is how this industry is going from zero (tariffs) to the potential of 200%,” Maytee Pereira of PwC told AP.Healthcare analysts say such a move could undermine Trump’s pledge to cut drug prices. “A tariff would hurt consumers most of all, as they would feel the inflationary effect ... directly when paying for prescriptions at the pharmacy and indirectly through higher insurance premiums,” wrote Diederik Stadig of ING, adding that low-income households and the elderly would be most exposed.Though Trump has suggested a one-year delay to give drugmakers time to stockpile or shift production to the US, analysts told AP the impact could still hit by 2027 or 2028 as inventories run down.Stadig warned that even a 25% levy could gradually raise US drug prices by 10–14%.Drugmakers have increasingly offshored production to countries such as China, India, Ireland and Switzerland, leaving the US with a nearly $150 billion trade deficit in pharmaceuticals last year. Analysts noted that 97% of antibiotics, 92% of antivirals and 83% of top generic drugs rely on at least one active ingredient manufactured abroad.“The only way to truly protect yourself from the tariffs would be to build the supply chain end to end in the United States,” Pereira said.While some global players such as Roche and Johnson & Johnson have announced multibillion-dollar US investments, experts told AP that generics — which make up 92% of prescriptions — could be hardest hit. Marta Wosinska of Brookings said generic manufacturers may exit the US market rather than bear costs, warning that even small supply shocks, as seen in past cancer drug shortages, can cripple patient care.“In an ideal world, we would be making everything that’s important only in the US,” Wosinska said. “But it costs a lot of money ... If we want to reverse this, we would really have to redesign our system. How much are we willing to spend?”","US President Donald Trump's plan to impose steep import taxes on pharmaceuticals is drawing sharp warnings.

The “biggest number in the world”

Hopeful but cautious

A broken system and the need for change





Harry Dent, the Harvard Business School graduate and economic forecaster often labeled a “doomsday expert” for his decades of bearish market predictions, has taken a surprisingly optimistic stance on cryptocurrency. In a recent conversation with Rich Dad Poor Dad author Robert Kiyosaki, Dent argued that Bitcoin and crypto technology could transform the $630 trillion global financial assets industry, an amount five times larger than the world’s GDP. While Dent maintains his trademark warnings about an imminent market correction, he also emphasized that crypto’s ability to decentralise and democratise finance could permanently alter the global economy.Dent drew comparisons between Bitcoin’s rise and previous disruptive forces like the internet and automation. He argued that just as the internet revolutionized communication and AI is now reshaping labor and productivity, crypto has the potential to completely rewire global finance. Unlike traditional systems, where transactions are funneled through banks, regulators, and layers of bureaucracy, crypto enables peer-to-peer exchanges that are faster, cheaper, and more transparent.For Dent, this is not simply about Bitcoin as a speculative asset but about blockchain as a foundation for a new era of financial innovation. He stressed that crypto could make access to money more direct and inclusive, particularly in regions underserved by conventional banking.One of Dent’s most striking points was his emphasis on the scale of the global financial services industry. He pointed out that financial assets worldwide are valued at approximately $630 trillion, five times larger than global GDP. In his words, this is “the biggest number in the world,” and it is this massive target that crypto is poised to disrupt. Dent suggested that while Bitcoin and crypto are still in their infancy, the scope of their potential impact is enormous, rivaling the world’s most powerful industries. If blockchain technology successfully integrates into mainstream finance, the way money is stored, transferred, and invested could be reshaped for generations.Despite his optimism, Dent was careful to temper expectations, warning that crypto and tech markets are approaching a critical correction. He specifically cited Bitcoin, the Nasdaq 100, and stocks like Nvidia as being in what he called a “declining channel,” suggesting that a shakeout is imminent. In his view, such corrections are not just unavoidable but necessary for innovation. “Failure is the secret to success,” he noted, explaining that downturns weed out weak projects and allow the strongest ideas to flourish. Dent believes this upcoming correction could actually strengthen crypto in the long run by clearing away speculative excess and leaving behind solid, utility-driven applications.Dent’s support for crypto also stems from his criticism of the traditional financial system. He argued that since 2008, governments and central banks have injected $29 trillion in stimulus into the global economy, yet growth has remained sluggish at just two to three percent annually. By his calculations, with that level of stimulus, growth should have been closer to seven to ten percent. For Dent, this disconnect proves that the current system, propped up by debt and money printing, is fundamentally flawed. In contrast, he sees crypto as a chance to build a more resilient and transparent financial infrastructure, one that reduces reliance on central authorities and empowers individuals directly.","Harry Dent, the Harvard Business School graduate and economic forecaster often labeled a “doomsday expert” for his decades of bearish market predictions, has taken a surprisingly optimistic stance on cryptocurrency. Dent argued that Bitcoin and crypto technology could transform the $630 trillion global financial assets industry, an amount five times larger than the world’s GDP.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123628342,imgsize-21970,width-400,resizemode-4/harvard39s-harry-dent-predicts-bitcoin-could-disrupt-630-trillion-financial-market-39the-biggest-number-in-the-world39.jpg"

Significance of the holiday







Labor Day, observed on the first Monday in September, honors the American labor movement and the millions of workers who power the US economy.

Trump’s wider crypto empire

Alt5’s chequered past





The Trump family’s latest foray into cryptocurrency has triggered questions over conflict of interest after a $750 million transaction put their businesses on both sides of the deal, The Wall Street Journal reported.According to the WSJ, the arrangement centres on World Liberty Financial (WLFI) — the Trump family’s flagship crypto venture launched last year. Earlier this month, WLFI took over Alt5 Sigma, a publicly listed payments firm that evolved from a pain-treatment business. Alt5 then raised $750 million from outside investors and used the funds to buy WLFI’s newly created cryptocurrency.That structure, the Journal said, will deliver the Trump family a windfall of about $500 million, since an entity it controls retains up to three-quarters of revenues from WLFI sales.Such “circular” transactions — with the same party effectively acting as both buyer and seller — are common in crypto markets but rare in traditional finance, and often raise red flags. Half a dozen former financial-market regulators told WSJ the deal could expose investors to risks, though it likely complies with US securities laws as long as disclosures are made.Public filings reviewed by WSJ show that President Donald Trump personally holds two-thirds of the WLFI tokens, with the family’s total stake valued at more than $6 billion on paper.Crypto has now overtaken real estate as the Trump family’s dominant business interest, overshadowing the former president’s half-century property empire.The WLFI token — described by the family as the crypto equivalent of an IPO — is set to debut trading on Monday. While some enthusiasts expect its value to soar, earlier Trump-linked tokens surged before collapsing, WSJ noted.The family could, in theory, earn billions more from the eventual public sale of WLFI’s 33 billion tokens, on top of those held directly. However, cashing out remains challenging: “even a small amount of selling can trigger prices to drop,” the report cautioned.Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump celebrated the deal alongside WLFI co-founder Zach Witkoff by ringing the Nasdaq opening bell in New York earlier this month. Warren Hui of Soul Ventures, one of the investors in Alt5’s fundraising, told WSJ: “They are launching their product at the right time with the right team.”Among backers in the $750 million raise were Point72 Asset Management, run by billionaire Steve Cohen, and Hong Kong-based Soul Ventures. Alt5 itself, valued at about $1 billion, has said it will accumulate WLFI under a “treasury strategy” modelled after MicroStrategy’s bitcoin purchases.Unlike MicroStrategy, however, Alt5 is buying tokens directly from WLFI — a related party that also controls supply. Alt5 paid 20 cents per WLFI token, a 50% premium to the price in a recent private sale, boosting the overall valuation.Howard Fischer, former senior trial counsel at the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), told WSJ: “We are in strange and uncharted territory in the securities world. People are making investment decisions that they wouldn’t make in other times.”Corey Frayer, a former SEC official who oversaw crypto policy, warned that the deal “brings the worst practices of the crypto ecosystem into regulated public markets.”While spokespeople for WLFI and Alt5 did not respond to WSJ’s requests for comment, the White House pushed back at criticism. Press secretary Karoline Leavitt said: “Neither the president nor his family have ever engaged, or will ever engage, in conflicts of interest.”Beyond WLFI, the family holds several billion dollars in $Trump memecoin and in Trump Media, the parent of Truth Social, which also invests in cryptocurrencies. WLFI separately runs a dollar-pegged stablecoin, USD1, and plans a crypto payments app.Launched last September with the slogan “Make America Great Again, this time with crypto,” WLFI had already raised $650 million privately, including funds from Chinese crypto billionaire Justin Sun, WSJ reported.Investors like Morten Christensen, founder of crypto site AirdropAlert, told the Journal they expect WLFI’s value to surge: “It ticks all the boxes for a token to go up violently,” he said, adding he hopes the president will tweet in support after trading begins.Until 2023, Alt5 operated as JanOne, a recycling and pain-medication company that settled SEC fraud allegations by paying a fine without admitting or denying charges. After buying a small crypto payments firm, it rebranded as Alt5 Sigma and pivoted into digital assets.WLFI paid for its stake in Alt5 using its own WLFI tokens, valued at $750 million. The deal also gave Eric Trump a board seat at Alt5 and installed Witkoff as chairman.As part of its strategy, WLFI has even indicated it will use profits from its USD1 stablecoin to buy back WLFI — a move a developer described on X as creating “permanent buying pressure.”","World Liberty Financial (WLFI) took over Alt5 Sigma, a publicly listed payments firm that evolved from a pain-treatment business.

US President Donald Trump marked Labor Day weekend by spotlighting what the White House described as “nearly $10 trillion” in new investments aimed at American workers, part of what officials are calling a “Golden Age of Prosperity. ”“President Trump believes that American workers are the heart and soul of our economy, which is why he’s championed an agenda that always puts them first — from signing the largest middle-class tax cuts in history to securing nearly $10 trillion in new investments to create high-paying jobs across our country,” White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers told Fox News.On Truth Social, Trump echoed that message while hoping for tariffs to remain amid legal setback, saying, ""Enjoy your Labor Day weekend.

At an “Investing in America” event in April, NVIDIA promised $500 billion for chipmaking, Apple pledged $500 billion to expand factories, IBM committed $150 billion for AI research, and SoftBank announced a $700 billion infrastructure project.

China's industrial production showed a slight improvement in August but remained in contraction for the fifth consecutive month, as per official figures released on Sunday, while trade negotiations with the United States persist before a new November tariff implementation.The Purchasing Managers' Index, a crucial industrial output indicator, reached 49.4, according to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), showing a marginal increase from July's 49.3, as reported by AFP. Bloomberg analysts had predicted the index would reach 49.5.The most recent figure above 50, indicating positive growth, was recorded in March.NBS statistician Zhao Qinghe viewed the month-on-month improvement as indication that ""overall economic prosperity continues to expand"". ""The business climate has improved,"" he said.The NBS had previously attributed July's manufacturing difficulties to adverse weather conditions, including floods and high temperatures.China's economic recovery post-pandemic has been challenging, facing issues including a property sector debt crisis, reduced consumption levels and high unemployment rates among young people.The ongoing trade dispute with the United States, currently paused pending negotiations, has affected China's export-driven economy.Both nations have extended their suspension of most reciprocal tariffs until November 10 as discussions continue.On Friday, senior Chinese trade negotiator Li Chenggang emphasised the need for ""equal dialogue and consultation"" between both countries after completing a three-day US visit, according to China's commerce ministry statement.","Purchasing Managers' Index reaches 49.4, up from July's 49.3.

Putin DIALS Friend Xi, Unites BRICS; China Leader Stuns Trump By Welcoming ‘Warming’ US-Russia Ties





Russian President Vladimir Putin criticised Western sanctions ahead of his four-day visit to China, warning that trade restrictions and the costs of the Ukraine war have pushed Russia’s economy into recession, as reported by Reuters.In a written interview with China’s Xinhua news agency on Saturday, Putin said Russia and China were united in rejecting “discriminatory” measures in global trade.Putin’s trip, which the Kremlin described as “unprecedented,” runs from Sunday to Wednesday. He will first attend the two-day Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit in Tianjin, before travelling to Beijing for talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping and to take part in a military parade marking the end of World War Two in Asia.The visit follows Xi’s May trip to Moscow, where the Chinese leader attended a military parade on Red Square celebrating the 80th anniversary of the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany. It was Xi’s 11th visit to Russia since becoming president.Since Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Western nations have imposed multiple rounds of sanctions. US President Donald Trump has also warned of “massive” new penalties unless peace talks progress.Putin, however, praised China’s role in shoring up economic ties. “To sum up, economic cooperation, trade and industrial collaboration between our countries are advancing across multiple areas,” he said. “During my upcoming visit, we will certainly discuss further prospects for mutually beneficial cooperation and new steps to intensify it for the benefit of the peoples of Russia and China.”Russia-China trade hit a record $245 billion in 2024, as Beijing increased purchases of Russian oil and expanded goods sales after Western countries cut economic ties with Moscow. “In recent years, the export of pork and beef to China has been launched. Overall, agricultural and food products occupy a prominent place in Russia’s exports to China,” Putin noted.He added that transactions were increasingly being conducted in rubles and yuan, and highlighted Russia’s role as China’s key oil and gas supplier.Putin did not directly address EU accusations that China has been aiding Russia’s war effort in Ukraine—allegations Beijing has consistently denied.The two leaders declared a “no limits” partnership in 2022 and have met more than 40 times in the past decade. Putin last visited China in 2024, a year after the International Criminal Court issued a warrant against him for the alleged illegal deportation of Ukrainian children.","Vladimir Putin says Russia and China are united in rejecting 'discriminatory' measures in global trade.

India ‘Laughs’ As Trump SCREAMS ‘Disaster’ At US Court’s Ruling Against Tariffs | ‘No Power To...’

Tariffs still in place (for now)



A $159 billion refund risk



Trump's negotiating power weakens



Supreme Court showdown looms



Limited backup options on tariffs



Even if the Supreme Court blocks his broad use of IEEPA, Trump still has fallback options — though far narrower.

Trade Act of 1974: Allows tariffs up to 15% for 150 days on countries with big US trade deficits.

Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962: Lets presidents impose tariffs on ""national security"" grounds (used before on steel, aluminium, and autos). But this requires a commerce department investigation and isn't instant.

The road ahead



(with inputs from agencies)





The US federal court's ruling over the tariff, calling it ""illegal"", came as a major setback for President Donald Trump . The court said that the Republican leader overstepped his authority when he declared trade deficits and border issues as ""national emergencies"" to justify sweeping tariffs he imposed on nearly every trading partner.Trump who has wielded tariffs as his favourite weapon in global trade battles, vowed to head toward Supreme Court. The bigger question is: what happens next?The US court of appeals for the federal circuit said that Trump went too far to justify his tariff weapon. The court upheld a May decision by a specialised federal trade court in New York, but allowed the Trump administration time to appeal to the Supreme Court.The decision was centred on the tariffs Trump imposed in April on almost all US trading partners and the levies he imposed before that on China, Mexico and Canada.Meanwhile, the court allowed the tariffs to remain in place while Trump appeals. That means businesses, consumers, and foreign governments are still living under the uncertainty of his trade war tactics — at least until the Supreme Court weighs in.US administration fears that if tariffs are ultimately struck down, then the Treasury could be forced to refund billions collected from importers. By July, tariff revenues had soared to $159 billion — more than expected.The justice department had warned that losing the case could mean ""financial ruin"" for the US — a dramatic warning that underscores how deeply tariffs now prop up federal revenue streams.""In such a scenario, people would be forced from their homes, millions of jobs would be eliminated, hardworking Americans would lose their savings, and even Social Security and Medicare could be threatened,"" solicitor general D John Sauer and assistant attorney general Brett Shumate said in a letter to the court, warning of an apocalyptic doomsday if tariffs were struck down.""In short, the economic consequences would be ruinous, instead of unprecedented success,"" the letter added.The ruling threatens one of Trump’s most potent bargaining chips. He has used the threat of tariffs to strong-arm countries into lopsided trade deals — as seen with the EU, Japan, and the UK.Without this tool, experts say, foreign governments may stall on commitments, resist US demands, or even try to reopen old deals. Trump could find himself negotiating from a position of weakness, not dominance.Trump has promised to take the case to the Supreme Court, blasting the appeals ruling as partisan and warning it would ""literally destroy the United States of America"" if upheld.""For many years, Tariffs were allowed to be used against us by our uncaring and unwise Politicians. Now, with the help of the United States Supreme Court, we will use them to the benefit of our Nation, and Make America Rich, Strong, and Powerful Again! Thank you for your attention to this matter,"" Trump wrote in a post on his social media platform.The dissenting opinion in the appeals court gives him a potential legal opening: some judges argued that emergency tariff powers do not violate the Constitution. That split makes it almost certain the Supreme Court will take up the case.These tools lack the sweeping, unilateral punch Trump has enjoyed — and could slow his ability to shock foreign governments into concessions.In the short term, Trump's tariffs stand. In the medium term, the Supreme Court will decide whether presidents truly have unchecked emergency powers to upend global trade.If Trump loses, America could face both a massive financial refund and a strategic reset in how it conducts trade negotiations.For now, US businesses, trading partners, and consumers remain trapped in limbo — waiting to see whether Trump's ""Liberation Day"" tariffs mark a new era of presidential trade authority, or an overreach cut down by the courts.","The US court of appeals for the federal circuit said that Trump went too far to justify his tariff weapon. The court upheld a May decision by a specialised federal trade court in New York, but allowed the Trump administration time to appeal to the Supreme Court.

China's trade representative Li Chenggang conducted meetings in the United States, between August 27-29, engaging with US officials regarding economic and trade relationships between the two nations, according to the Chinese commerce ministry on Saturday, quoted by Reuters.During his visit, Li conducted meetings with officials from the US department of the treasury, department of commerce, and office of the US trade representative to discuss the progress of previously established agreements.Li emphasised that both nations should address their differences and strengthen collaborative efforts through balanced discussions and consultations.This comes as the US Senate Armed Services Committee visited Taiwan on Friday to “reemphasize the partnership and the security, friendship agreement” between the two sides, at a time when both Taipei and Beijing are seeking trade deals with Washington.The US does not formally recognize Taiwan as a country but remains its largest arms supplier and key security partner, with their forces frequently conducting joint military drills to counter China.Beijing, which claims Taiwan as its own territory, has repeatedly objected to deepening US-Taiwan ties, condemning such visits and accusing Washington of endangering peace. On Friday, China’s Foreign Ministry reiterated its firm opposition to any official exchanges between the US and Taiwan.However, earlier this month, amid the tense China-Taiwan situation, Trump had said that Chinese President Xi Jinping had assured him China would not invade Taiwan during his presidency, Reuters reported. The comments came in a Fox News interview ahead of Trump’s talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine.“I will tell you, you know, you have a very similar thing with President Xi of China and Taiwan, but I don't believe there's any way it's going to happen as long as I'm here. We'll see,” Trump told Fox News’“He told me, 'I will never do it as long as you're president.'

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.","Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain.

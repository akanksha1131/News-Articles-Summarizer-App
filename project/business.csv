The firm's consolidated volume grew 2% during the quarter. Asia Pacific recorded a 6% volume growth, led by India, while volumes declined by 3% in North America.

Apart from India, China, Indonesia, Russia, Argentina and Venezuela are among the countries under ""priority watch.""While citing concerns over the patent regime - from revocations to discretionary invocation of patentability criteria and delays - the US Trade Representative in its latest Special 301 Report also pointed to some of the gains it made. For instance, there was a word of praise for the special IPR benches in high courts as well as the Patent (Amendment) Rules notified last year. The report, however, said that stakeholders continued to express concerns over vagueness in the interpretation of the Indian Patents Act.At the same time, it also raised the red flag over high customs duty - US President Donald Trump's pet peeve - on several IP-intensive products, including medicines, medical devices, IT goods, solar equipment, medical devices and capital goods. It flagged significant concerns over ""inadequate enforcement"" and asserted that India is among the top sources of counterfeit medicines.The report also said copyright holders continue to report high levels of piracy, particularly online and also accused India of not complying with some of its commitments given under WIPO treaties. ""Furthermore, stakeholders have reported continuing problems with unauthorised file sharing of video games, signal theft by cable operators, commercial-scale photocopying and unauthorised reprints of academic books, and circumvention of technological protection measures. ""The other worry is the insufficient legal framework to protect trade secrets. ""Criminal penalties are not expressly available for trade secret misappropriation in India and civil remedies reportedly are difficult to obtain and do not have a deterrent-level effect. US and Indian companies have identified trade secret protection as a growing concern and expressed interest in India eliminating gaps in its trade secrets regime, such as through the adoption of trade secret legislation that comprehensively addresses these concerns.

Had you listened to your grandmother and bought gold on Akshaya Tritiya , your investment would have earned handsome returns. Rising geopolitical tensions and widespread economic uncertainty have pushed gold prices to almost Rs 10,000 per gram. Gold bought on this auspicious day has delivered double-digit returns in the past 25 years.A substantial portion of these returns is attributable to the dramatic rise in gold prices in the past four years. Gold prices have more than doubled from Rs 47,452 per 10 grams in April 2021 to Rs 98,955 now. Investments in the yellow metal since 2021 have yielded more than 20 per cent returns. That’s more than what equity funds have delivered in the past four years.However, though gold prices have moved up smartly, the yellow metal has also witnessed extended periods of muted returns. Between 2014 and 2018, the annualised return from gold was less than 2 per cent. Gold could not even beat the 4.8 per cent annual consumer inflation during that period.Many financial advisors consider gold a dead investment that doesn’t generate any income or pay dividends. While that is true to some extent, gold is an excellent diversification tool because its price is not linked with other asset classes.During a geopolitical crisis or periods of high inflation, equities tend to do poorly. But these conditions are good for gold. The negative correlation reduces the portfolio risk. Gold is also a very liquid asset and can be bought and sold across global markets.Experts forecast a further upside in 2025. Geopolitical tensions have only increased, and the new occupant in the White House has triggered a worldwide tariff war.Even so, don’t look at gold as a speculative bet. Rather, treat it as a wealth preservation tool and portfolio diversifier. Experts advise that investors should not put more than 15-20 per cent of their overall portfolio in the yellow metal.With gold hitting Rs 1 lakh per 10 grams, many investors may be thinking of booking profits. With the removal of the indexation benefit in 2023, gains from gold are now added to the income of the investor and taxed at normal rates.But Sovereign Gold Bonds (SGBs) offer a unique tax advantage to investors. SGBs are issued by the RBI, and their prices are linked to the price of gold. Investors get 2.5 per cent interest every year, which is fully taxable. But if SGBs are held till maturity, the capital gains from the investment are tax-free.","Gold bought on this auspicious day has delivered double-digit returns in the past 25 years.

China’s manufacturing drops in April as US trade war impact starts to show,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/chinas-manufacturing-drops-in-april-as-us-trade-war-impact-starts-to-show/articleshow/120748553.cms,"AP file photo

China Urges Nations to Resist ‘Bully’ Trump | Bloomberg: The China Show 4/29/2025

China’s manufacturing activity declined in April after showing signs of recovery in March, according to government data released on Wednesday. The slump comes amid rising trade tensions with the United States, which recently imposed heavy tariffs on Chinese goods.The Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) — an important indicator of factory activity — dropped to 49 in April, down from 50.5 in March, which had been the highest reading in 12 months. The April figure was also lower than the 49.7 expected by a Bloomberg survey.According to China’s National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), the drop was linked to both a strong performance the previous month and increased trade pressure. “In April, affected by factors such as a high base from earlier rapid manufacturing growth and a sharp shift in the external environment, the manufacturing PMI fell,” said NBS statistician Zhao Qinghe, as quoted by AFP.This fall in manufacturing comes just weeks after the United States imposed tariffs of up to 145% on many Chinese products. Beijing responded with 125% tariffs on several US imports.Although Chinese exports had jumped by over 12% in March as firms rushed to ship goods before the new tariffs kicked in, domestic issues remain. The country is still recovering from the Covid-19 pandemic, struggling with low consumer demand and a long-running property sector crisis.To address these challenges, Chinese authorities have introduced stimulus measures, including rate cuts and relaxed home-buying rules. They’ve also set a goal to create 12 million new urban jobs this year and maintain 5% economic growth, matching last year’s target.","The Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) — an important indicator of factory activity — dropped to 49 in April, down from 50.5 in March.

JP Morgan CEO: Best case scenario for US economy is a recession

First-quarter US GDP figures to be released on Wednesday are expected to reveal a sharp slowdown — and possibly signal a recession — due to a spike in imports rushed in before president Donald Trump's broad tariffs took effect.Since returning to office on January 20, president Trump announced several rounds of tariffs and a universal 10% base tariff on all imports from top trading partners, along with a steep 125% tariff specifically on Chinese goods.After April’s market turmoil, the Trump administration paused higher tariffs for 90 days to allow trade talks, but kept a 10% base rate for most nations and imposed new China-specific tariffs totalling 145%.The tariff announcement triggered a market selloff, driving volatility to its highest levels since the Covid-19 pandemic and unsettling investors.Analysts had predicted that the economy would grow by about 2% in 2025, but since Trump returned to office and introduced new tariffs, many have lowered their forecasts including Wall Street titans Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley.Some even expect the economy to shrink in the first quarter. Even if it doesn’t shrink, growth is expected to slow down significantly—just 0.4% in the first quarter, compared to 2.4% in the last quarter of 2024, according to Briefing.com.","First-quarter US GDP figures to be released on Wednesday are expected to reveal a sharp slowdown — and possibly signal a recession.

The US administration announced plans to implement measures by Tuesday to reduce the impact of automotive import tariffs , allowing manufacturers additional time to shift production to US soil.While the 25 per cent tariffs on imported vehicles and components will continue, they will be restructured to prevent overlap with other tariffs, including those on steel and aluminium, according to a White House representative, quoted by the New york Times. Vehicle manufacturers will be exempt from paying multiple tariffs on these essential materials.Manufacturers will receive partial compensation for tariffs paid on imported components. The reimbursement scheme will provide up to 3.75 per cent of a new vehicle's value in the first year, gradually decreasing over two years, as confirmed by the spokesperson.The automotive industry responded positively to these changes. ""We believe the president's leadership is helping level the playing field for companies like GM and allowing us to invest even more in the US economy,"" Mary T Barra, CEO of General Motors, said in a statement Monday. ""We appreciate the productive conversations with the president and his administration and look forward to continuing to work together. ""The 25 per cent vehicle import tariff became effective April 3, with an expansion to include parts scheduled for Saturday.""President Trump is building an important partnership with both the domestic automakers and our great American workers,"" Howard Lutnick, the commerce secretary, said in a statement. ""This deal is a major victory for the president's trade policy by rewarding companies who manufacture domestically, while providing runway to manufacturers who have expressed their commitment to invest in America and expand their domestic manufacturing,"" he further added.At Tuesday morning's news conference, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt announced Trump's intention to sign an auto tariff-related executive order. Additionally, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, while avoiding specific details about tariff relief, emphasised the policy's focus on encouraging domestic production.However, despite the adjustments, significant tariffs will remain on imported vehicles and components, resulting in substantial price increases for new and used vehicles, alongside higher repair and insurance costs.","The US administration announced plans to reduce the impact of automotive import tariffs. Manufacturers will receive partial compensation for tariffs paid on imported components. The reimbursement scheme will provide up to 3.75 per cent of a new vehicle's value in the first year, gradually decreasing over two years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120739449,imgsize-1830878,width-400,resizemode-4/120739449.jpg"

Canadian firm The Metals Company (TMC) announced on Tuesday that it has submitted application to the United States for deep-sea mineral mining in international waters. This marks the first such application, supported by President Donald Trump’s push for the industry.The minerals targeted by TMC are crucial for manufacturing electric vehicle batteries and electric cables, as reported by AFP. However, environmental groups have expressed concerns about the potential ecological impact of extracting these resources.TMC USA, a subsidiary of The Metals Company, is seeking a license to mine polymetallic nodules , multi-metal deposits found in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone of the Pacific Ocean.Gerard Barron, chairman and CEO of The Metals Company, called the move ""a major step forward for America’s mineral independence and industrial resurgence.""The company initially planned to submit its application to the International Seabed Authority (ISA) but changed course due to delays in the ISA’s development of mining regulations . Shortly after, President Trump issued an executive order to speed up the review process for mining permits, including those for international waters.Environmental groups, including Greenpeace, have criticized the application, arguing that deep-sea mining could harm fragile ecosystems.","The Metals Company (TMC) announced on Tuesday that it has submitted application to the United States for deep-sea mineral mining in international waters.

India and US 'very close' to sign trade deal: US treasury secretary Scott Bessent,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/india-and-us-very-close-to-sign-trade-deal-us-treasury-secretary-scott-bessent/articleshow/120738616.cms,"The United States and India are on the verge of finalising a major bilateral trade agreement , treasury secretary Scott Bessent said on Tuesday.Signalling what could be the first such deal under US President Donald Trump, he said that the two countries are ""very close"" to a breakthrough.Speaking alongside White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, Bessent praised New Delhi’s approach, calling it “much easier” to negotiate with India than other nations due to the country's relatively low non-tariff trade barriers Scott had also earlier signaled this finalisation, attributing it to India’s “fewer non-tariff trade barriers, obviously, no currency manipulation, very, very little government subsidies, so that reaching a deal with the Indians is much easier,” Bessent said during a press briefing held on the sidelines of the World Bank and IMF’s annual meetings in Washington DC.The deal, once formalised, would mark a significant milestone in President Trump’s efforts to reset global trade relations under the banner of fairness and reciprocity.Currently, Indian exports to the US face a 10 per cent tariff. Under the proposed policy shift, a 26 per cent reciprocal tariff is scheduled to come into effect on 8 July unless a new deal is struck.The latest remarks hint that India could be the first to secure a bilateral pact with Washington that aligns with Trump’s trade vision, making it a key player in reshaping US economic partnerships.The talks come amid broader American efforts to deepen strategic and economic ties with India. Earlier during his visit to India US vice president JD Vance, had urged to eliminate remaining non-tariff barriers and boost imports of American energy and defence goods.According to US Census Bureau data, India accounted for nearly 3 per cent of all American imports as of February. The US trade deficit with India stood at $45.7 billion in 2024, highlighting the scale and importance of the bilateral economic relationship.Bessent also confirmed that discussions are ongoing with Japan and South Korea. He noted that South Korea’s upcoming presidential election in June is unlikely to hinder progress on a separate deal with Seoul.","U.S. treasury secretary Scott Bessent said that the two countries are ""very close"" to a breakthrough.

'Compromise won't earn you mercy': China refuses to bow down to US tariff 'bullying',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/compromise-wont-earn-you-mercy-china-refuses-to-bow-down-to-us-tariff-bullying/articleshow/120738059.cms,"China issued a fiery response, condemning the United States' global trade practices, accusing Washington of “bullying”, “deception” and economic coercion, as tensions over tariffs continue to escalate.In a video post shared on X on Tuesday, the Chinese ministry of foreign affairs compared America’s actions to a storm with a deceptive calm warning allies that bowing to US pressure was similar to “drinking poison to quench thirst”.The video opens with the video of a raging ocean storm, with the audio, “Have you heard of the eye of the storm? It appears calm for a moment but is actually a deadly trap. But calm before an even fiercer storm.”It accused the US of deliberately targeting China by forcing other countries to limit trade with China, playing a “90-day pause game.”However, China reaffirmed its firm opposition to the US, warning that yielding to American tariffs would be “like drinking poison to quench thirst.” To defend its stance, Beijing pointed to past instances where countries like Japan and France faced US accusations that ultimately undermined their national industries.“History has proven that compromise won't earn you mercy — kneeling only invites more bullying.”It said, “China won't kneel down because we know standing up for ourselves keeps the possibility of cooperation alive while compromise snuffs it out.”The ministry further asserted that China won't back down, “so the voices of the weak will be heard.”China also urged other nations to unite in pushing back against the US, asserting that America does not speak for the world and that its share of global production and trade accounts for less than one-fifth.“We have the power to push back when the choice of the world stands together in solidarity.”Taking another jibe at Washington, it said that “the US is just a small stranded boat. Imperialists are always arrogant. If they show a bit of reason, it's only because they're forced to do so.”The statement closed with a firm message, warning that the United States will continue to “flip flopping and playing hardball” in its approach to global trade, but insisting that China will not waver.“No matter how hard the wind blows, no matter how clouds rage, the darker the night, the brighter the stars shine,” it declared.China further called for action, saying that “someone has to step forward, torch in hand to shatter the fog and illuminate the path ahead.” It called on all nations to stand tall and united, arguing that only through collective strength can the world break free from the grip of hegemony.“When every nation stands tall, the world will break through the walls of hegemony. For China, for the world, we must rise and fight on,” the message stated.China had earlier warned, opposing any country securing a deal with the United States at the expense of Chinese interests and vowed to take ""countermeasures"" if interests are compromised.This strong message comes amid rising diplomatic friction, with Beijing flatly denying claims by Donald Trump that Chinese President Xi Jinping had recently called him to discuss the worsening trade dispute. The Chinese foreign Ministry said “no such call” had taken place, contradicting Trump’s assertions to Time magazine and at a White House press briefing.“As far as I know, there has been no phone call between the two heads of state recently,” said foreign ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun on Monday. “China and the United States are not conducting consultations or negotiations on tariff issues.”Trump’s tariffs, now as high as 145% on Chinese goods, are rattling markets and hitting American consumers and manufacturers alike. But China, for now, appears unfazed in its stance.","The Chinese ministry of foreign affairs compared the US to a storm, warning allies that bowing to US pressure was similar to “drinking poison to quench thirst” It accused the US of deliberately targeting China by forcing other countries to limit trade with China, playing a “90-day pause game”","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120738430,imgsize-435722,width-400,resizemode-4/120738430.jpg"

American consumer confidence in the economy has dropped to its lowest level since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic. The Conference Board reported a sharp 7.9-point decline in April, bringing the index down to 86, marking the lowest reading since May 2020.The decline is being largely attributed to growing concern over tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump ’s administration, which have included a 10 per cent levy on most imports and a steep 145 per cent tariff on Chinese goods, along with duties on steel, aluminium and automobiles.Nearly one-third of consumers now expect a slowdown in employment—levels not seen since April 2009 during the Great Recession. An Associated Press-NORC Center survey also found that around half of Americans are worried about a potential recession.""Rattled consumers spend less than confident consumers,"" said Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics. ""If confidence sags and consumers retrench, growth will go down.""The index measuring short-term expectations for income, business conditions and employment dropped 12.5 points to 54.4—its lowest in over 13 years and far below the threshold of 80, which often signals a looming recession.The largest drops in confidence were seen among Americans aged 35 to 55 and those earning more than $125,000 annually.Also read: US job openings drop to 7.2 million in March amid tariff-driven uncertainty Market volatility has contributed to the downturn in sentiment, with the S&P 500 down 6 per cent for the year, the Dow Jones falling 5 per cent, and the Nasdaq declining by 10 per cent in 2025 despite recent recoveries.Spending intentions have weakened across the board. Fewer Americans are planning to purchase homes or cars, amid high mortgage rates and property prices. Overseas vacation planning has dropped from 24.1 per cent in December to 16.4 per cent in April. Restaurant spending plans also saw a historic decline.The US government is set to release its report on first-quarter economic growth on Wednesday, with economists projecting a notable slowdown following a robust holiday spending season. Meanwhile, Friday’s Labor Department report is expected to reflect continued job growth , although some analysts anticipate a marked dip in hiring.Consumer expectations of a downturn within the next 12 months have reached a two-year high.","American consumer confidence in the economy has dropped to its lowest level since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic.

US job openings drop to 7.2 million in March amid tariff-driven uncertainty,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/international-business/us-job-openings-drop-to-7-2-million-in-march-amid-tariff-driven-uncertainty/articleshow/120735464.cms,"AI-generated image (Credit: Bing image creator)

Job openings in the United States declined in March, reflecting growing economic uncertainty tied to President Trump’s trade policies. Trump had announced implementation of import tariffs in march to be effective from April but just days later, announced a 90-day pause on all countries except China.According to Tuesday’s report from the US Labor Department, employers advertised 7.2 million positions in March — down from 7.5 million in February and 8.1 million in March 2024. The figure fell short of economists’ expectations of 7.5 million and marked the lowest level since September.The Job Openings and Labor Turnover Summary (JOLTS) report also noted a slight uptick in voluntary resignations, a sign that workers remain confident in the labor market. Redundancies fell to their lowest point since June, further suggesting resilience in hiring.While job vacancies remain historically elevated, they have steadily declined from a peak of 12.1 million in March 2022, during the post-pandemic recovery.Despite elevated interest rates from the Federal Reserve aimed at curbing inflation, the labor market has shown notable durability. Both private and public sector organizations have continued to recruit workers.However, economic prospects remain uncertain, shaped by presidential policies such as high import tariffs, reductions in federal employment, and crackdown on immigration.Notably, the recently implemented federal employment cuts under Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency had minimal impact in March. Federal dismissals fell to 8,000 — down from 19,000 in February, which was the highest since November 2020.“The job market is continuing to hold its own, but barely,” said Robert Frick, an economist at Navy Federal Credit Union, in comments to the Associated Press. “While job openings dropped below forecasts, they haven’t reached a post-Covid low,” he added.Frick warned that the apparent stability may be temporary: “Hiring holds steady and layoffs dipped a bit, showing that, overall, employers are clinging to the employees they have. But this is likely the calm before the storm, as layoffs are pending in government contractors, manufacturers, and other sectors impacted by government layoffs and tariffs.”","US employers advertised 7.2 million positions in March, down from 7.5 million in February and 8.1 million in March 2024.

The firm’s consolidated volume grew 2% during the quarter. Asia Pacific recorded a 6% volume growth led by India while volumes declined by 3% in North America. Coca-Cola reports unit case volume which factors in the total number of unit cases of beverages sold by the company and its bottling partners.“We saw a good momentum in Asia Pacific driven by a good quarter in India in particular. We saw a strong volume growth across our portfolio in India and increased household penetration,” said James Quincey, chairman and CEO at The Coca-Cola Company during the firm’s earnings call on Tuesday.The company’s net revenues declined by 2% to $11.1 billion on the back of currency headwinds and the impact of refranchising bottling operations. “In India, Trademark Coca-Cola and Thums Up, a cherished regional brand are fueling consumers and contributed to double-digit volume growth for the market in the first quarter,” the company said.

US President Donald Trump is set to ease the impact of automotive tariffs, a move designed to support US carmakers by removing overlapping import duties on parts used in domestically assembled vehicles and reimbursing levies already paid, according to the news agency Reuters.The decision, which will be officially announced during Trump’s Tuesday visit to Michigan, comes amid growing concern from the auto industry over the economic fallout of sweeping tariffs.According to CNN, the revised structure will ensure that cars built in the US using imported components are not hit by cumulative duties, such as those on steel and aluminium, in addition to the 25 per cent auto tariff.“This deal is a major victory for the President's trade policy by rewarding companies who manufacture domestically, while providing runway to manufacturers who have expressed their commitment to invest in America and expand their domestic manufacturing,” commerce secretary Howard Lutnick said in a statement.According to The Wall Street Journal, which first reported the development, automakers will also be eligible for reimbursements for tariffs they have already paid. A White House official confirmed the report, noting that the relief plan would become official on Tuesday. General Motors CEO Mary Barra was quoted by Reuters praising the move and saying, “We believe the President’s leadership is helping level the playing field for companies like GM and allowing us to invest even more in the US economy.”Ford’s CEO Jim Farley echoed that view, calling the plan “helpful in mitigating the impact of tariffs on automakers, suppliers and consumers.”As per BBC, Trump is expected to announce the easing of tariffs during a rally in Michigan, a key automotive hub and home to major manufacturers like Ford, GM, and Stellantis, as well as over 1,000 auto suppliers.Industry groups had earlier warned of serious consequences if the 25% tariffs on imported parts came into full effect. In a letter cited by CNN, carmakers including Toyota, Volkswagen, and Hyundai said, “Tariffs on auto parts will scramble the global automotive supply chain... raise auto prices for consumers, lower sales at dealerships and make servicing vehicles more expensive.”Automakers will be reimbursed up to 3.75% of a car’s value in the first year, with the benefit being phased out over two years, reported The New York TimesThe decision comes just days before the tariffs were set to take full effect on May 3.Shares of Asian carmakers rose sharply following the news.

Despite lingering concerns over global trade and macroeconomic uncertainty, early gains suggested a cautiously optimistic tone on Wall Street As of 1.04 pm EDT, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) plunged 132.11 points, or 0.33%, to 39,981.39.

Domino's referred to the current global macroeconomic environment as “challenging.”Trump's on-again-off-again tariffs may have pushed households and businesses to alter their spending and freeze plans for long-term investment because of how quickly conditions could change, seemingly by the hour.Despite a market rally last week, as talk of Trump firing Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell receded and hints emerged of a selective softening of his stance on tariffs, not much had changed, Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management said.“But let’s not kid ourselves: this wasn’t a clean pivot,"" Innes said. ""It was hope and narrative management, plain and simple. What was really driving the bounce wasn’t hard policy action — it was the perception of de-escalation.""Trump had said he was on a path to cut several new trade deals in a few weeks, but had also suggested it was “physically impossible” to hold all the needed meetings.The hope was that if Trump rolled back some of his stiff tariffs, he could avert a recession that many investors saw as otherwise likely because of his trade war.Shares of Deliveroo, the food delivery service based in London, had hit three-year highs after it received a $3.6 billion takeover offer from DoorDash.

Donald Trump’s tariff hit: How Chinese firms are looking at Indian exporters to maintain their US clientele,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/donald-trumps-tariff-hit-how-chinese-firms-are-looking-at-indian-exporters-to-maintain-their-us-clientele/articleshow/120693812.cms,"AI-generated image (Credit: Bing image creator)

NEW DELHI: China-based enterprises, impacted by escalating US tariffs imposed under Donald Trump administration, are seeking assistance from Indian exporters to maintain their American clientele amid significant disruptions in global trade.During the recently concluded Canton Fair in Guangzhou (May 5), several Chinese firms approached Indian companies to help fulfil US customer orders, according to Ajay Sahai, Director General of the Federation of Indian Export Organizations (FIEO), as reported by Bloomberg. Indian firms are expected to receive commissions for facilitating these transactions.The US has imposed tariffs of up to 145 per cent on Chinese exports, while Indian goods currently face a 10 per cent levy, scheduled to rise to 26 per cent in July if President Donald Trump implements reciprocal tariffs after a 90-day pause.Previously, Chinese exporters had established operations in Vietnam or routed goods through Thailand to reach US markets. However, Trump’s imposition of 46 per cent tariffs on Vietnam has limited these alternatives, potentially opening up more opportunities for Indian exporters.Due to India's restrictions on Chinese investments, Chinese firms cannot establish operations or use India as a mere transit point.Instead, Chinese companies at the Canton Fair proposed that Indian firms supply goods under Chinese brands or through co-branding arrangements, Sahai said.Enquiries primarily came from sectors such as hand tools, electronics, and home appliances. Sahai noted that direct negotiations between US customers and Indian suppliers are also likely, with commission structures for Chinese firms determined during buyer-supplier discussions.""Some four to five companies have approached us,"" said Siddhant Aggarwal, export officer at Jalandhar-based OayKay Tools, a manufacturer of drop forge hammers and cold stamp machines. ""They have a brand name to maintain, so they need to service their customers.""India’s growing export opportunities coincide with advancing trade discussions with the Trump administration. During a recent visit to India, US Vice President JD Vance reaffirmed prospects for a bilateral trade deal, targeted for completion by autumn.Meanwhile, US-China tensions over tariffs remain high. Beijing has dismissed the high levies as ""meaningless,"" while Trump claims negotiations are ongoing. However, China denies any active discussions, reiterating demands for the removal of unilateral tariffs.While American attendance was relatively low at the start of the Canton Fair, tariff concerns dominated discussions. Many Chinese firms, facing the 90-day grace period, accelerated investments in Southeast Asia to bypass US restrictions.Jalandhar-based Victor Forgings, established in 1954, is optimistic about growth amid the evolving trade landscape. Managing Partner Ashwani Kumar said the company has been approached by both Chinese suppliers and US firms with Chinese operations seeking alternatives due to supply chain disruptions . Kumar also revealed plans to set up two new manufacturing units to meet rising demand, noting that American firms are willing to share technical expertise to help Indian manufacturers expand capacity.Meanwhile, in its trade war with US, China asserted on Monday that it maintained a righteous position in its ongoing trade dispute with the United States. The US levied a substantial 145 percent duty on its primary competitor, whilst China retaliated with a 125 percent duty on American products.During a press conference, senior Chinese economic official, Zhao Chenxin , warned that the US trade conflict would have adverse consequences. ""We firmly believe that if you are against the world and the truth, you will only isolate yourselves. Only by travelling with the world and with morality can we win the future.""According to AFP, Chenxin criticised the US for its unilateral actions and intimidation tactics, stating they created ""cards out of thin air, bully and go back on their word.""Additionally, Beijing announced enhanced measures to protect China's declining economy from the effects of this confrontation.

For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of carbon use per year.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Space sector start-up Sisir Radar to develop SAR on L/P band SAR,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/space-sector-start-up-sisir-radar-to-develop-sar-on-l/p-band-sar/articleshow/104558111.cms,"CHENNAI: Space sector startup, Sisir Radar Private Ltd has hit success at the prestigious iDEX DefSpace Challenge with its projects for development of “L/P band Continuous Wave SAR (synthetic aperture radar) payload for LEO Small Satellites” and “Unfurlable, Electronically Steering Antenna for L/P band SAR payload” for Indian Air Force (IAF), said a top company official.The company is promoted by former Director at the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) Tapan Misra and the brains behind the Indian space agency’s RISAT series of SAR satellites as well as the Dual Frequency SAR on the Chandrayaan 2 orbiter that is currently circling the moon.""A grant of Rs 3 crore is also there for development of the products,"" Misra told IANS.Synthetic Aperture Radar or SAR is a special kind of imaging radar technology that can provide extremely accurate high resolution imagery of the terrain through clouds, smoke and dust even in pitch dark conditions. SAR imagery provides much higher resolution than other forms of remote sensing technology such as hyperspectral and multispectral. SAR is a critical technology for strategic reconnaissance and planning as well as for disaster management.According to Misra, winning the challenge in just over a year of floating the company is a major booster.He said L and P band SAR have an advantage over other frequencies (like X band) when it comes to penetration capabilities through rain, clouds, foliage and vegetation in a tropical country like India, and underground penetration capabilities in dry terrain.Continuing further, he said the L band SAR will provide 1 metre resolution, spotlight resolution in Stripmap mode. The current industry standard is 5-10 metre in L band. Misra said both the L and P band will operate simultaneously from a satellite borne SAR. Recently, Sisir Radar successfully developed and tested the world’s highest resolution L-Band SAR fitted on a drone. With 0.2 metre resolution, this is by far the highest L band SAR in the world, he said.","Space sector startup, Sisir Radar Private Ltd has hit success at the prestigious iDEX DefSpace Challenge.

Testify: Sam Bankman-Fried acknowledges 'mistakes' but testifies he did not defraud anyone,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/cryptocurrency/sam-bankman-fried-acknowledges-mistakes-but-testifies-he-did-not-defraud-anyone/articleshow/104761929.cms,"<p>Sam Bankman-Fried (File Photo- Reuters)<br></p>

NEW YORK: Sam Bankman-Fried , testifying in his own defense at his fraud trial on Friday, acknowledged that a ""lot of people got hurt"" when the FTX cryptocurrency exchange he founded collapsed, but said he did not defraud anyone or take customer funds.Shortly after taking the witness stand in Manhattan federal court, Bankman-Fried said he made ""a number of small mistakes and a number of larger mistakes"" while running the now-bankrupt exchange. The biggest mistake, he said, was not implementing a dedicated risk management team.""We thought that we might be able to build the best product on the market,"" Bankman-Fried said. ""It turned out basically the opposite of that. A lot of people got hurt - customers, employees - and the company ended up in bankruptcy.""Prosecutors accuse Bankman-Fried of using FTX customer funds to prop up his crypto-focused hedge fund, Alameda Research, make speculative venture investments and donate more than $100 million to US political campaigns. He also faces charges of scheming to cheat Alameda's lenders and FTX investors.He has pleaded not guiltyBankman-Fried's trial, which began on October 3, is drawing to a close nearly a year after FTX collapsed amid a wave of customer withdrawals. The company declared bankruptcy in November 2022 and Bankman-Fried was indicted the following month.His testimony marked the first time the dozen jurors and five alternates have heard directly from the 31-year-old former billionaire after 12 trial days.Bankman-Fried, who was jailed in August after US District Judge Lewis Kaplan found he likely tampered with witnesses, wore a suit and spoke with two water bottles placed in front of him on the witness stand. The former mogul once known for wearing shorts and T-shirts and sporting an unkempt mop of curly locks cut his hair before his trial began.Responding to questions posed by his defense lawyer Mark Cohen, Bankman-Fried spoke in calm, measured tones during the first portion of his testimony as he recounted founding Alameda in 2017, shortly after graduating from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, despite knowing little about crypto.But Bankman-Fried - who had studied physics and worked as a quantitative trader at Jane Street - said he saw opportunities for ""arbitrage"" in the market for digital assets. He said Alameda's first office was in a small Airbnb in Berkeley, California, before he later moved the firm to Hong Kong.""We wanted to be under the radar at that point in time,"" he said on the stand, adding he named the hedge fund after the California county where it was founded in part so competitors would not discover what they were doing.Jurors have heard from three of his closest confidantes at FTX and Alameda, all of whom have pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors. They testified earlier this month that they committed financial crimes at Bankman-Fried's behest.For criminal defendants, taking the stand is a risky proposition because it opens them up to potentially probing cross-examination by prosecutors.But given Bankman-Fried's penchant for risk, legal experts say he likely viewed taking the stand as his best shot to counter the allegations made by members of his inner circle, which were backed up by spreadsheets the three said demonstrated how customer funds were stolen and text messages in which they discussed FTX's shortfall of funds with Bankman-Fried.","Sam Bankman-Fried says he made ""a number of small mistakes and a number of larger mistakes"" while running the now-bankrupt exchange.

"Crypto isn’t dead, it’s evolving rapidly to create a new world",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/cryptocurrency/crypto-isnt-dead-its-evolving-rapidly-to-create-a-new-world/articleshow/101324954.cms,"Regulatory landscape



There are few technologies as confusing to most people as crypto and blockchain. The tech and regulations underpinning it are evolving so rapidly, it is difficult for even technologists to often make sense of it.Crypto assets and crypto currencies are based on blockchain tech, which is a form of distributed ledger technology that stores data on thousands of data servers around the world, as opposed to today where data is stored only in one place or clustered in a few locations. This data is open, meaning it can be viewed and verified by anyone taking part in that particular system. What this means practically is that an individual can transfer crypto assets without the help of intermediaries, say, banks or government agencies, thereby ensuring privacy, speed and lower costs.The first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin , was created with anonymity in mind, it was a way for people to conduct financial transactions away from the prying eyes of governments. While it went on to become a speculative asset, today, crypto, and the underlying blockchain technology, has a far more ambitious goal – the transformation of the internet.CoinDCX CTO Vivek Gupta says this technology can help usher in Web 3. 0 – a decentralised form of the internet where users can actually monetise their time spent online. “Whatever Web3 use case you may be driving, the value that comes from it must be distributed, and you cannot distribute that without crypto. For something as simple as depositing money in a pool and getting a receipt token, that receipt token is a crypto. That’s the proof that I have deposited the money. Without crypto there is no Web3 use case,” he says.Decentralised finance (DeFi) is a huge part of what makes blockchain tech so disruptive. Imagine being able to lend your money to strangers on the internet and get paid an interest. Or imagine spending time on socialmedia platforms or playing video games and getting paid for your time spent by someone who needs data about you. Web3 makes this possible because the data isn’t controlled by any one company or country.Decentralised apps (dApps) are another Web3 feature. Unlike traditional apps hosted on centralised servers, dApps operate on a peer-to-peer network and utilisethe consensus mechanism and transparency features of blockchain technology.“I see a big disruption coming, especially in the DeFi tokenisation space and the whole content creator economy,” says Ravi Chamria, co-founder & CEO of Zeeve, a blockchain automation platform.Ashish Singhal, co-founder & CEO of CoinSwitch, says the tech can revolutionise how we conduct business, store data, and even vote, since the tech allows people to verify data of any kind efficiently.Governments are worried about what crypto could mean for monetary policy, for their ability to regulate people’s lives. But disruption hardly ever requires consensus. If a new technology proves to be better than an old one, people will drift towards it.Central banks have recognised the importance of the technology and some are creating Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) that are based on blockchain technology. “There’s a lot of activity happening in the regulated DeFi space. Looking at the future, we think guardrails are probably a good thing to have around these sorts of technologies,” says Andrew Vranjes, VP of sales at Blockdaemon, a blockchain infrastructure platform.Cryptocurrencies too are rapidly changing. Where before the value of cryptocurrencies were based on what people were willing to pay for them, today there are crypto assets that are backed by real world assets like equity and real estate. Silvina Moschini’s Unicoin is one of them. “It is an assets backed, audited, SEC-compliant cryptocurrency,” she says.","Crypto assets and crypto currencies are based on blockchain tech, which is a form of distributed ledger technology that stores data on thousands of data servers around the world.

"US tightens crackdown on crypto with lawsuits against Coinbase, Binance",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/cryptocurrency/bitcoin/us-tightens-crackdown-on-crypto-with-lawsuits-against-coinbase-binance/articleshow/100810119.cms,"BROKER, EXCHANGE CRACKDOWN



NEW YORK: The top U.S. securities regulator sued cryptocurrency platform Coinbase on Tuesday, the second lawsuit in two days against a major crypto exchange, in a dramatic escalation of a crackdown on the industry and one that could dramatically transform a market that has largely operated outside regulation.The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Monday took aim at Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange. The SEC accuses Binance and its CEO Changpeng Zhao of operating a ""web of deception"".If successful, the lawsuits could transform the crypto market by successfully asserting the SEC's jurisdiction over the industry which for years has argued that tokens do not constitute securities and should not be regulated by the SEC.""The two cases are different, but overlap and point in the same direction: the SEC's increasingly aggressive campaign to bring cryptocurrencies under the jurisdiction of the federal securities laws,"" said Kevin O'Brien, a partner at Ford O'Brien Landy and a former federal prosecutor, adding, however, that the SEC has not previously taken on such major crypto players.""If the SEC prevails in either case, the cryptocurrency industry will be transformed.""In its complaint filed in Manhattan federal court, the SEC said Coinbase has since at least 2019 made billions of dollars by operating as a middleman on crypto transactions, while evading disclosure requirements meant to protect investors.The SEC said Coinbase traded at least 13 crypto assets that are securities that should have been registered, including tokens such as Solana, Cardano and Polygon.Coinbase suffered about $1.28 billion of net customer outflows following the lawsuit, according to initial estimates from data firm Nansen. Shares of Coinbase's parent Coinbase Global Inc closed down $7.10, or 12.1%, at $51.61 after earlier falling as much as 20.9%. They are up 46% this year.Paul Grewal, Coinbase's general counsel, in a statement said the company will continue operating as usual and has ""demonstrated commitment to compliance.""Oanda senior market analyst Ed Moya said the SEC ""looks like it's playing Whac-A-Mole with crypto exchanges,"" and because most exchanges offer a range of tokens that operate on blockchain protocols targeted by regulators, ""it seems like this is just the beginning.""Leading cryptocurrency bitcoin has been a paradoxical beneficiary of the crackdown.After an initial plunge to a nearly three-month low of $25,350 following the Binance suit, bitcoin rebounded by more than $2,000, exceeding the previous day's high. It was trading just below $27,000 at 0410 GMT.""The SEC is making life nearly impossible for several altcoins and that is actually driving some crypto traders back into bitcoin,"" explained Oanda's Moya.Securities, as opposed to other assets such as commodities, are strictly regulated and require detailed disclosures to inform investors of potential risks. The Securities Act of 1933 outlined a definition of the term ""security,"" yet many experts rely on two U.S. Supreme Court cases to determine if an investment product constitutes a security.SEC Chair Gary Gensler has long said tokens constitute securities and has steadily asserted its authority over the crypto market, focusing initially on the sale of tokens and interest-bearing crypto products. More recently, it has taken aim at unregistered crypto broker dealer, exchange trading and clearing activity.While a few crypto companies are licensed as alternative system trading systems, a type of trading platform used by brokers to trade listed securities, no crypto platform operates as a full-blown stock exchange. The SEC also this year sued Beaxy Digital and Bittrex Global for failing to register as an exchange, clearing house and broker.""The whole business model is built on a noncompliance with the U.S. securities laws and we're asking them to come into compliance,"" Gensler told CNBC.Crypto companies refute that tokens meet the definition of a security, say the SEC's rules are ambiguous, and that the SEC is overstepping its authority in trying to regulate them. Still, many companies have boosted compliance, shelved products and expanded outside the country in response to the crackdown.Kristin Smith, CEO of the Blockchain Association trade group, rejected Gensler's efforts to oversee the industry.""We're confident the courts will prove Chair Gensler wrong in due time,"" she said.Founded in 2012, Coinbase recently served more than 108 million customers and ended March with $130 billion of customer crypto assets and funds on its balance sheet. Transactions generated 75% of its $3.15 billion of net revenue last year.Tuesday's SEC lawsuit seeks civil fines, the recouping of ill-gotten gains and injunctive relief.On Monday, the SEC accused Binance of inflating trading volumes, diverting customer funds, improperly commingling assets, failing to restrict U.S. customers from its platform, and misleading customers about its controls.Binance pledged to vigorously defend itself against the lawsuit, which it said reflected the SEC's ""misguided and conscious refusal"" to provide clarity to the crypto industry.Customers pulled around $790 million from Binance and its U.S. affiliate following the lawsuit, Nansen said.On Tuesday, the SEC filed a motion to freeze assets belonging to Binance.US, Binance's U.S. affiliate. The holding company of Binance is based in the Cayman Islands.""It's important to note that recent regulatory actions are aimed at ensuring that companies operating in the cryptocurrency industry are complying with securities laws and protecting investors - this will always be their goal,"" said Joshua Chu, group chief risk officer at blockchain technology firms XBE, Coinllectibles and Marvion.""These events will ultimately lead to a more stable and trustworthy industry, which could help to attract more institutional investors and mainstream adoption.""","The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Monday took aim at Binance.

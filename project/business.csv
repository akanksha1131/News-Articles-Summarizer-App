Despite Trump 'Economic Sanctions', India's Russian Oil Flow Ramped Up As U.S Trade Talks Resume

India’s Crude Oil Trade with Russia

Who bought Russia's fossil fuels after EU bans





India, faced with 25% additional penal tariffs for its crude trade with Russia, has reportedly asked the US to allow oil imports from Iran and Venezuela.Following international sanctions due to the Ukraine conflict, Russia began offering its oil at reduced prices. With India importing nearly 90% of its oil requirements, the cost-effective Russian supplies have helped reduce its import expenses. Similar price advantages could be available from Iranian and Venezuelan supplies.According to a Bloomberg report, Indian officials, during their US visit this week, reiterated their stance to the Trump administration regarding oil imports. They suggested that any substantial decrease in Russian oil purchases by Indian refiners would necessitate Washington's approval for crude imports from Iran and Venezuela, both currently under sanctions, the report said.During the discussions with Trump officials, the visiting delegation underscored their position, a source was quoted as saying. The Indian officials emphasised that restricting their refiners' access to oil from Russia, Iran and Venezuela simultaneously could potentially trigger a worldwide price surge, as confirmed by individuals familiar with the ongoing negotiations.Indian officials visited the United States for discussions following Washington's implementation of 50% tariffs on India.The country has continued importing Russian crude, though at reduced volumes, despite these penalties.During his visit to New York, Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal indicated India’s intention to enhance its US oil and gas procurement, stating that ""our energy security goals will have a very high element of US involvement"".Since the Russia-Ukraine conflict began in 2022, India has significantly increased its crude oil imports from Russia.Finland's Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA) data shows India purchased Russian oil worth ₹132 billion (about ₹13.39 lakh crore) from early 2022. This accounts for 20% of Russia's overall oil export revenue of ₹640 billion during this timeframe.Despite Western opposition, Russian oil continues to be available in global markets without complete restrictions, allowing countries such as India and China to obtain it at discounted rates.India's additional purchases included Russian coal valued at ₹16 billion, taking its total fossil fuel imports from Russia to ₹148 billion. Russia's total earnings from oil, gas, and coal exports since the conflict began amounted to ₹931 billion.CREA data indicates that while Chinese Russian oil imports were ₹193 billion, India's purchases exceeded both the EU's ₹105 billion and Turkiye's ₹71 billion.China ranked as Russia's top customer with total fossil fuel imports of ₹268 billion, with the EU following at ₹213 billion, India at ₹148 billion, and Turkiye at ₹111 billion.","Since the Russia-Ukraine conflict began in 2022, India has significantly increased its crude oil imports from Russia.

In a big cheer at the start of the festive season, the next generation GST reforms announced by the Modi government come into effect today, on September 22, 2025.From today, a plethora of household items, cars, TVs, bikes will become cheaper for the common man and middle class. Many food items have been moved to the NIL or 0% tax bracket. These include roti, parantha, paneer, khakra etc. Importantly, health and life insurance premiums will be exempt from GST.The new GST rates, first announced by FM Nirmala Sitharaman earlier this month, reduce the tax slabs to two broad rates - 5% and 18%. While most items under GST have seen rate cuts, some limited items will now also be dearer with higher tax rates - such as clothes priced above Rs 2,500 will now attract a higher GST rate of 18% compared to 12% before.Ahead of the GST rate cuts becoming effective, PM Narendra Modi addressed the nation saying, “With sunrise on September 22nd, the first day of Navratri, the Next Generation GST reforms will come into effect.In a way, a GST savings festival is going to begin in the country from tomorrow. This GST Savings Festival will increase your savings, and you'll be able to purchase the things you want more easily. The poor, middle class people, neo middle class, youth, farmers, women, shopkeepers, businessmen, entrepreneurs of our country, everyone will benefit a lot from this savings festival. ”“Due to reduction in GST, it will now be easier for the citizens of the country to fulfill their dreams. Be it building a house, buying a TV, a refrigerator, or buying a scooter, bike, or a car, you'll have to spend less on all of these. Travelling will also become cheaper for you, as GST has been reduced on rooms in most hotels,” he added.","New GST rates effective today: 0%, 5%, 18% & 40% Tax Brackets. The 40% tax is for goods that are either categorized as sin or luxury. Below is a full list of items that now attract 0, 5, 18% and 40%.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124031450,imgsize-61380,width-400,resizemode-4/new-gst-rates-2025-full-list.jpg"

President Droupadi Murmu on Friday highlighted the need for India to become self-reliant in producing rare earth elements, saying this is vital in the current geopolitical climate and will play a key role in the country’s journey towards becoming a developed nation.Speaking at the National Geoscience Awards 2024, she further added that it would ensure the security of the country.The President explained that these minerals are not considered rare because of their limited supply, but because the process of identifying them is highly complex. She also highlighted that developing homegrown techniques would be crucial in overcoming this challenge.President Murmu pointed out that rare earth elements are central to the technologies shaping the modern world, from artificial intelligence and semiconductors to clean energy solutions.The rare earth elements or REEs are a group of 17 chemically alike metallic elements which are of vital importance to the development of modern technologies including smartphones, electric vehicles, renewable energy systems and wind turbines.She said the mines ministry is working to ensure sustainability and innovation in the sector, with projects that include AI- and drone-based surveys and efforts to extract valuable materials from mine tailings.The President also used the occasion to highlight the need for better disaster preparedness. Referring to the heavy damage caused this year by cloudbursts and landslides, she urged scientists to strengthen research into floods, landslides, earthquakes and tsunamis.""It is my appeal to the geoscientist community to pay more attention on the research of natural calamities like flood, landslide, earthquake, and tsunami,"" she said, adding that new technologies should be developed to ensure timely alerts reach the public.Instituted in 1966 by the mines ministry and earlier known as the National Mineral Awards, the National Geoscience Awards remain one of the country’s most prestigious honours in the geoscience field.","President Droupadi Murmu highlighted the need for India to become self-reliant in producing rare earth elements.

After 50% Tariff, Donald Trump Hits India With 100% Tax on Medicines, Targets Pharma Companies



Trump Tariff Uncertainties Loom





Pharma stocks hit by Trump’s tariffs: Pharmaceutical stocks declined sharply by up to 5% on Friday, September 26, following US President Donald Trump's declaration of imposing 100% tariffs on branded and patent-protected medicines. Sun Pharma experienced the steepest decline, touching its yearly low at Rs 1,547, showing a 5% reduction from its last closing price. Biocon witnessed a 3.3% fall to Rs 344, whilst Zydus Lifesciences declined by 2.8%, settling at Rs 990.Aurobindo Pharma decreased by 2.4% to Rs 1,070, and Dr. Reddy's registered a 2.3% decline to Rs 1,245.30. Both Lupin and Cipla saw a 2% reduction, ending at Rs 1,923.30 and Rs 1,480, respectively. Torrent Pharma showed the smallest decline of 1.5%, reaching Rs 3,480.65.At approximately 9:30 am, the Nifty Pharma index showed a reduction of 2.54%.As per the announcement on Truth Social platform, Trump declared that from October 1, all imported branded or patented medicines to the United States would face a 100% tariff, unless manufacturers establish production facilities within the country.Several prominent Indian pharmaceutical firms, including Sun Pharma, Dr. Reddy's Laboratories, Cipla, Lupin, Aurobindo Pharma, and Zydus Lifesciences, maintain substantial export operations to the USA.Additional pharmaceutical entities such as Syngene, Gland Pharma, Biocon, and Piramal Pharma also generate considerable revenue from the American market, particularly through generics, speciality medications, and biosimilars.The announcement specifies that exemptions would be granted solely to companies that have initiated construction or are actively developing pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities in the U.S. This policy aims to strengthen domestic production whilst reducing dependence on international sources for premium, patent-protected medications.""There will, therefore, be no Tariff on these Pharmaceutical Products if construction has started,"" the post clarified, defining ""IS BUILDING"" as having commenced physical construction or site development.The declaration is likely to affect Indian pharmaceutical companies that presently produce their branded medicines abroad for the American market. Share prices of businesses with substantial US export presence will be under close observation, alongside domestic medicine producers who could gain from possible alterations in worldwide supply networks.","US President Donald Trump's declaration of imposing 100% tariffs on branded and patent-protected medicines.

US President Donald Trump on Friday publicly demanded that Microsoft dismiss Lisa Monaco, the company’s president of global affairs and a former top official in Democratic administrations.In a lengthy Truth Social post, Trump claimed ‘corrupt and totally Trump deranged’ Monaco posed risks to national security because of her past government roles. “She is a menace to US National Security, especially given the major contracts that Microsoft has with the United States Government,” Trump wrote.“Because of Monaco’s many wrongful acts, the US Government recently stripped her of all Security Clearances, took away all of her access to National Security Intelligence, and banned her from all Federal Properties.”Trump added that “it is my opinion that Microsoft should immediately terminate the employment of Lisa Monaco.”According to news agency Reuters, Monaco began working at Microsoft in July, taking charge of the firm’s global engagement with governments. Her LinkedIn profile confirms the appointment.She previously served as a national security aide under Barack Obama , helped coordinate the justice department’s response to the January 6 Capitol attack, and was deputy attorney general during Joe Biden ’s administration.Trump linked his demand to Monaco’s role in the Biden justice department, which pursued legal cases against him. He argued that her senior position at Microsoft, with access to sensitive information, was “unacceptable.”The criticism comes after former FBI director James Comey, a longtime Trump adversary, was indicted on obstruction and perjury charges.Trump has said he expects “others” to face prosecution, according to Reuters.The attack on Monaco highlights Trump’s broader pattern of targeting perceived political enemies. Since returning to the White House in January, he has pushed for charges against several figures, including former national security adviser John Bolton and Democratic Senator Adam Schiff, and has exerted pressure on institutions ranging from law firms to universities.The president’s interventions have also extended into corporate America. His administration previously demanded the resignation of Intel’s chief executive, pressed Disney’s ABC over comedian Jimmy Kimmel’s show, and influenced decisions at other major firms.Meanwhile, Microsoft continues to navigate its relationship with the administration. Earlier this month, CEO Satya Nadella attended a White House dinner with Trump and other technology leaders.The company has also been under scrutiny for its contracts with US agencies and, separately, for restricting certain cloud services to a unit of the Israeli military following a review of alleged surveillance practices, reported CNBC.",Lisa Monaco is Microsoft's president of global affairs.

NEW DELHI/HYDERABAD: India's generic companies are likely to continue in business-as-usual mode as US President Donald Trump's 100% levy on pharmaceuticals is targeted at branded and patented medicines, but it may also prompt some of them to rethink their playbook.Industry experts told TOI that the country's largest drugmaker Sun Pharma could face headwinds as its drug sales in US totalled $1.1 billion in FY25 (in which patented drugs have a significant portion), which was around 17% of its total revenue. Analysts added that branded biosimilars manufactured by companies, including Biocon, may be affected.Companies with manufacturing bases in US - including Sun Pharma, Dr Reddy's and Cipla - could cushion the blow by shifting production of higher-value specialty and niche drugs from India to the American facilities, said experts. Over time, the move could drive companies to diversify export markets, recalibrate global strategies, shift to contract manufacturing in the US and set up manufacturing bases there to safeguard access to the world's most lucrative market.""At this point, we do not see an impact,"" Dr Reddy's co-chairman & MD G V Prasad said, adding, the company also does not see expanding its manufacturing footprint in the US immediately.""Domestic companies are examining all options to mitigate risk, ranging from setting up manufacturing facilities in the US to shifting production of high-value specialty drugs, niche therapies and peptides to existing plants,"" an industry expert said. India's pharma exports to the US were close to $10 billion last year and it serviced around 35% of US prescriptions with affordable generics.""India plays a vital role in US healthcare by ensuring a steady supply of affordable medicines. A majority of life-saving cardiac, diabetes and chronic medicines are supplied from India,"" said Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance secretary general Sudarshan Jain. Deepak Jotwani, VP & sector head, corporate ratings, Icra added, ""Overall, this move by the US underscores the need for Indian pharma companies to diversify markets and innovate in complex generics and biosimilars to stay resilient in a changing global trade landscape. ""Pharmexcil chairman Namit Joshi said most large Indian companies already operate manufacturing or repackaging units in US and are exploring further acquisitions. ""India will need to reinforce its cost-efficiency advantage in bulk drugs and APIs, an area where the US is likely to favour India over other suppliers, and simultaneously invest in next-generation opportunities, such as complex generics, peptides and biosimilars. ""The pharma sector is awaiting more clarity on the announcement as it did not specify whether speciality drugs, niche or complex generic drugs are under its ambit.

MUMBAI: The impact of restrictions on H-1B visas by the United States on remittances by overseas Indians would be within $5bn, according to a Barclays research report. The report also said that the rising trend of global capability centers (GCCs), which includes many US-headquartered firms, is here to stay and would strengthen further amid this likely H-1B overhaul, instead of acting as a drag on services exports.Earlier this month, US President Donald Trump announced two changes for the H-1B visas: a one-time $100,000 fee for new visas, and a wage-based selection process, which replaces the existing lottery-based selection system, favouring higher-skilled and higher-paid applicants by giving them multiple entries in the selection pool.""The impact of these new rules, in terms of likely loss of jobs and dependent livelihoods cannot be discounted, but the effect via remittance is unlikely to breach $5bn (out of a total of $83bn).

Algo diplomacy: How Xi Jinping used TikTok to court Donald Trump,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/donald-trump-signs-tiktok-order-xi-jinping-bytedance-ltd-us-china-trade-deal/articleshow/124161748.cms,"AI image for representation only.

TL;DR: Driving the news

Big Win For Trump Amid Trade Faceoff With China, TikTok Algorithm Now Under American Oversight

Why it matters

The TikTok manoeuvre isn’t just about data privacy or algorithms. It’s about leverage the in ongoing US-China trade war.

Xi's quiet greenlight - not yet officially confirmed by Beijing - is part of a larger effort to reset US-China ties on China’s terms. And Trump, who once threatened to ban the app outright, now gets to tout himself as the man who saved TikTok and satisfied national security hawks.

As per a New York Times report, at its core, this is a story about how Xi Jinping turned a tech headache into a diplomatic lever, and how Donald Trump transformed a national security threat into a personal political win.

Interestingly, both leaders are using TikTok - a wildly popular app among American youth - to serve entirely different agendas:

For Xi: TikTok is no longer Beijing’s tech crown jewel. It’s a bargaining chip. China now sees more value in trading it for potential relief on US tariffs, export restrictions on AI chips, and diplomatic breathing room around Taiwan.

TikTok is no longer Beijing’s tech crown jewel. It’s a bargaining chip. China now sees more value in trading it for potential relief on US tariffs, export restrictions on AI chips, and diplomatic breathing room around Taiwan. For Trump: TikTok is a campaign lifeline. He credits it for helping him reach young voters in 2024 and boasts 15 million followers on the platform. Now, he gets to claim he “saved TikTok,” appeased security hawks, and secured a deal that looks tough on China - without actually banning the app.

TikTok is a campaign lifeline. He credits it for helping him reach young voters in 2024 and boasts 15 million followers on the platform. Now, he gets to claim he “saved TikTok,” appeased security hawks, and secured a deal that looks tough on China - without actually banning the app. The timing also matters:

Beijing is under pressure: With economic headwinds at home, mounting Western export controls, and a post-pandemic slowdown, China is recalibrating its tone with Washington.

The US is headed toward a tech decoupling cliff: The deal sets a precedent for how Chinese tech can (or can’t) operate inside the American ecosystem - especially around algorithms, user data, and influence risks.

Congress is watching: The deal's structure - a licensed algorithm, American-controlled board, Oracle oversight - could become a template or a cautionary tale.

""It’s not just about who owns the app,"" Jasmine Enberg of Emarketer told AP. ""It’s about who controls the algorithm, the data, and ultimately, the narrative.""

In short: This isn’t a tech transaction. It’s a calculated act of tech diplomacy - one that could shape the next phase of the US-China rivalry and redefine the limits of digital sovereignty.

The big picture

What’s in the deal:

ByteDance keeps under 20% ownership and one board seat in the new company, TikTok US.

Oracle and Silver Lake will lead the investor group, alongside Abu Dhabi’s MGX. Trump also name-checked Michael Dell and Rupert Murdoch as investors.

Oracle gets algorithm oversight. The TikTok algorithm will be licensed from ByteDance, retrained solely on US data, and supervised by “trusted” American partners.

Data storage stays in Oracle’s cloud, with no ByteDance access to US user info.

Between the lines

What they are saying

“Young people really wanted this to happen,” Trump said.

He also admitted he would make TikTok “100% MAGA” if he could - though he insists the new app will be fair to “every philosophy.”

“There’s much bigger fish to fry,” Yun Sun, the director of the China program at the Stimson Center in Washington, told the NYT. “If China can use these small concessions to trade for a positive atmosphere, better US-China relations, they will want to do it,” she said, referring to TikTok.

""It’s not just about who owns the app,"" Jasmine Enberg of Emarketer. ""It’s about who controls the algorithm, the data, and ultimately, the narrative.

Bloomberg Opinion’s Catherine Thorbecke put it: “In China, ‘win-win’ means China wins twice.”

What’s next

The TikTok deal may be just Act I. Trump and Xi are expected to speak again soon - possibly setting up a summit next month during the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in South Korea.

Such a sit-down would mark their first in-person meeting since Trump returned to the White House - and could shape the next phase of global tech, trade, and military diplomacy.

Xi reportedly wants to host Trump in Beijing - both for symbolism and control. China is wary of another diplomatic misfire, like Ukraine’s Zelensky being publicly scolded at the White House.

Congressional review: Lawmakers are not convinced this setup truly complies with the 2024 law. Republican Rep. John Moolenaar says he plans to “discuss these issues with the transaction parties.”

Beijing’s final word: China must still issue a license for the algorithm’s export - a critical step that could derail or delay implementation.

Tech decoupling accelerates: Even if the TikTok deal succeeds, the broader push to sever strategic tech ties with China continues - from semiconductors to AI models.





President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Thursday endorsing a $14 billion deal that would spin off TikTok’s US operations from its Chinese owner ByteDance. The move aims to meet the legal requirement set by a 2024 law forcing ByteDance to divest or face a ban in the US.But the headline-grabbing deal is more than a tech breakup. It’s a strategic olive branch from China - and President Xi Jinping appears to be playing a long game.“I had a very good talk with President Xi,” Trump said from the Oval Office. “We talked about TikTok and he gave us the go-ahead.”As the New York Times and Bloomberg have noted, China’s sudden acquiescence to a divestment it once labeled “robbery” has sparked questions about what’s being traded behind the scenes - and whether the most valuable export here isn’t TikTok’s algorithm, but goodwill from Beijing.The TikTok deal is part tech workaround, part geopolitical theater. On paper, it creates a US-based joint venture with a mostly American board and ownership structure. In reality, it’s a finely tuned diplomatic signal.JD Vance, Trump’s vice president, said the deal will put the new TikTok’s valuation at “roughly $14 billion” - a figure that Emarketer says aligns with its expected 2026 ad revenue.The algorithm - TikTok’s secret sauce - is at the center of the national security debate. While ByteDance keeps ownership, the new algorithm will be “rebuilt from the ground up” with Oracle's oversight, per US officials.“American investors will actually control the algorithm,” Vance emphasized.Still, skepticism remains: “Has ByteDance truly lost control?” asked Alan Rozenshtein of the University of Minnesota. “That’s far from clear.”Meanwhile, Beijing has been deliberately vague. No formal statement of approval. No confirmed export license. But state-run media described the deal as a “win-win,” and Xi’s silence suggests strategic consent - not surrender.(With inputs from agencies)","TikTok algorithm will be licensed from ByteDance, supervised by “trusted” American partners.

Turkish Airlines has announced plans to expand its fleet through a major deal with US-based Boeing. In a Friday filing to the Istanbul Stock Exchange, Turkey's national carrier said it aims to add up to 225 aircrafts.The airline said it will purchase 75 Boeing 787-9 and 787-10 Dreamliners, including 50 confirmed and 25 optional orders, with deliveries slated between 2029 and 2034. These long-haul aircraft are described as advanced and fuel-efficient, tailored for international routes, as reported by AP.In a parallel deal, Turkish Airlines finalised negotiations for 150 Boeing 737-8/10 MAX jets—100 confirmed and 50 optional orders—and will move ahead once engine supplier CFM International completes talks. The company is also negotiating with Rolls-Royce and GE Aerospace for engines, spare parts and maintenance services for the new fleet.The announcement came a day after Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan met US President Donald Trump in Washington. This marks a pivot from the earlier standing between the two nations as, during Trump’s first term, the US removed Turkey from the F-35 fighter jet program in 2019 over Ankara’s purchase of a Russian air defense system. However, Trump has recently signaled that Washington may soon lift its hold on sales of advanced fighter jets to the Nato ally.With this expansion, Turkish Airlines will continue to be one of the world’s largest flight networks, connecting Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Americas.","Turkey's national carrier said it aims to add up to 225 aircrafts.

Dollar strengthens, commodities rise







Asian markets opened cautiously on Friday after US President Donald Trump announced a fresh set of tariffs, while investors lowered expectations for significant Federal Reserve interest rate cuts following stronger-than-anticipated economic data.Trump revealed plans to levy a 100% tariff on imported branded pharmaceuticals, 25% on heavy-duty trucks, and 50% on kitchen cabinets.

Meanwhile, European futures posted modest gains, with EUROSTOXX 50 contracts up 0.37% and FTSE futures rising 0.25%.Investor sentiment was further dampened as expectations of aggressive Fed easing were tempered by robust economic indicators.Economists at Wells Fargo noted that recent GDP figures confirm the US economy’s resilience in the first half of the year despite unpredictable trade policy.Traders now anticipate roughly 39 basis points of rate reductions by December, slightly lower than the 40-plus basis points forecast earlier this week. “Markets had built in optimism for four to six cuts, but now it looks like four is the most likely scenario, and even that may be generous,” said Sycamore.While most Fed officials remain cautious on future rate moves, newcomer Stephen Miran has advocated for sharp reductions to avoid a labor market downturn, reported Reuters.The dollar strengthened in response, hovering near 150 yen.

Wall Street struggled on Thursday, heading toward a rare three-day losing streak as investors digested stronger-than-expected US economic data and corporate results.The S&P 500 fell 0.7% in early trading, marking a deeper decline than the previous two days, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 107 points, or 0.2%, and the Nasdaq composite slid 1%. All three indexes remained close to the record highs set earlier this week, AP reported.Economic reports showed fewer US workers filed for unemployment benefits last week, suggesting layoffs may be slowing. The US economy also grew faster in the spring than previously estimated, and orders for manufactured goods with a relatively long life span exceeded forecasts, adding pressure on expectations for future interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. Treasury yields ticked higher, with the 10-year note rising to 4.17% and the two-year yield climbing more sharply.CarMax tumbled 19.1%, the largest loss in the S&P 500, after reporting weaker quarterly profits and fewer vehicle sales compared with last year. Loss projections from past loans also weighed on the stock.Big Tech stocks, which have driven recent market gains, also fell. Nvidia declined 1.8%, Broadcom lost 2.9%, and Alphabet dropped 2.2%, reflecting investor caution about high valuations amid artificial intelligence enthusiasm.Starbucks fluctuated between modest gains and losses after announcing a $1 billion restructuring plan that includes store closures and cutting 900 non-retail jobs, most recently down 0.7%.European markets followed a weaker trend, with Germany’s DAX falling 1% and France’s CAC 0 down 0.7%, after Asia saw a more muted finish.","The S&P 500 fell 0.7% in early trading, marking a deeper decline than the previous two days.

The US economy grew at an unexpected 3.8 per cent annualised pace in the second quarter, significantly higher than the previously estimated 3.3 per cent, government data showed Thursday. The revision highlights a strong rebound from a first-quarter contraction of 0.6 per cent and underscores the influence of shifting trade patterns on the country’s economic performance.Imports, which surged earlier in the year as businesses rushed to beat tariff deadlines, fell by 29.3% in the second quarter, AP reported. The drop added more than five percentage points to GDP, the department noted. Consumer spending also accelerated, rising at a 2.5% pace compared with 0.6% in the first quarter.The Trump administration has imposed double-digit tariffs on imports ranging from steel and aluminum to autos, a move the president argues protects US industry and offsets the cost of his sweeping tax cuts. “With tariffs, we are bringing factories back and making America strong again,” Trump has repeatedly said.But mainstream economists caution the protectionist strategy risks slowing growth and fuelling inflation.They argue tariffs are paid by US importers, who often pass costs to consumers. While inflationary effects have so far been modest, economists warn the unpredictable tariff rollouts have unsettled businesses and dampened hiring.Labour Department data revisions this month showed that 911,000 fewer jobs were created in the year ending March than first reported, pulling the monthly average down to 71,000. Since March, job growth has slowed further, averaging just 53,000 a month.The Fed, seeking to support the labour market, cut its benchmark interest rate last week for the first time since December.

Employees who are being eliminated will be informed early Friday, while the closures will be rolled out in the coming days.The Seattle-based coffee chain said a review of its North American locations showed many outlets were underperforming financially or not meeting customer expectations. “Each year, we open and close coffeehouses for a variety of reasons, from financial performance to lease expirations. This is a more significant action that we understand will impact partners and customers. Our coffeehouses are centers of the community, and closing any location is difficult,” Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol wrote in a letter to staff, as quoted by AP.Following the move, Starbucks expects to end its fiscal year with 18,300 stores in North America, down 124 from last year. It is unusual for the company to reduce its store count within a fiscal year.Niccol, a turnaround specialist brought in a year ago to revive Starbucks, previously led Chipotle through a dramatic recovery. During his six-year tenure there, the brand doubled its revenue and profit while its stock price soared.Starbucks said it will offer severance and support packages to employees affected by the layoffs.","Starbucks is laying off around 900 non-retail employees and shutting some stores in the US and Canada.

China’s move ‘to safeguard WTO’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/chinas-move-to-safeguard-wto/articleshow/124102771.cms,"



China will no longer claim benefits available to developing nations at the World Trade Organization, announced Chinese Premier Li Qiang. He is currently in the US to attend the United Nations General Assembly. WTO director general Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala welcomed the decision on X, calling it “a culmination of many years of hard work” and thanking China’s leadership. The gesture is significant at a time when higher US tariffs are forcing China to divert ever more of its exports to rising economic powers from Latin America to Africa and Southeast Asia, a push that’s starting to meet resistance around the world.And as Beijing looks to negotiate a more lasting trade deal with the US, it’s also likely an effort to curry favour with President Donald Trump, who has long bristled at the designation he’d said was unfairly applied to the world’s second-biggest economy.While no longer eligible for the special treatment, China’s status as a developing nation won’t change, Han Yong, a ministry of commerce official in charge of relations with WTO, said in Beijing on Wednesday. Wendy Cutler, a senior vice president at the Asia Society Policy Institute and veteran US trade negotiator, said the announcement is “years too late”.“In light of the absence of a WTO negotiating agenda and the slow pace of its reform efforts, the announcement — while welcome — will have little practical effect,” said Cutler.But it “will help Beijing make the case of its enduring commitment to the multilateral trading system, in sharp contrast to Washington which is holding up its dues to the organisation.”China’s move not to claim the benefits “is an important measure to safeguard and strengthen the multilateral trading system”. The US Trade Representative and the White House didn’t immediately respond to a request for more information on the announcement.","China will no longer claim benefits available to developing nations at the World Trade Organization, announced Chinese Premier Li Qiang.

Argentina-US swap line talks: Washington proposes $20 billion support; peso rises 2.4% ahead of elections,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/argentina-us-swap-line-talks-washington-proposes-20-billion-support-peso-rises-2-4-ahead-of-elections/articleshow/124094625.cms,"File photo (AP)





The US Treasury is in discussions with Argentina to provide a $20 billion swap line to the South American country’s central bank, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Wednesday, as right-wing President Javier Milei seeks to stabilise markets ahead of upcoming midterm elections. Following the announcement, the Argentine peso gained 2.4 percent to 1,333.90 per dollar.“The Treasury is currently in negotiations with Argentine officials for a $20 billion swap line with the Central Bank,” Bessent said in a social media post, a day after he and US President Donald Trump spoke with Milei, AFP reported. He added that the US is also prepared to purchase Argentina’s dollar-denominated bonds as needed.Milei, an ally of Trump in Latin America, thanked the US leadership for their “support and confidence.” Swap lines allow central banks to exchange currencies at predetermined rates for a specified period, helping stabilise markets during periods of financial stress.Trump, speaking on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly, said the US would assist Argentina but added, “I don’t think they need a bailout.” Argentina’s currency had weakened sharply after Milei’s party lost the Buenos Aires provincial election on September 7, a key indicator ahead of national legislative elections on October 26.Bessent emphasised that Argentina “has the tools to defeat speculators, including those who seek to destabilise Argentina’s markets for political objectives.” However, domestic criticism emerged, with Senator Elizabeth Warren calling a potential US intervention “deeply troubling” and questioning the use of emergency funds to bolster a foreign government’s financial markets.The announcement comes as Milei faces declining support following two years of austerity measures and a corruption scandal involving his sister, after initially being cheered by investors upon his 2023 election.","The US Treasury is in discussions with Argentina to provide a $20 billion swap line.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.","Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain.

Startups will play important role in helping India become 3rd largest economy: CEA Nageswaran,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/startups-will-play-important-role-in-helping-india-become-3rd-largest-economy-cea-nageswaran/articleshow/105332523.cms,"Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor ( CEA ) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran Udaan until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.Udaan built an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business still accounts for a very small part of India’s overall retail market but can balloon to $150 billion in sales and yield a 100% return on capital invested in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co. estimates published in the Mint newspaper.Bengaluru-based Udaan has also ventured into financing through its fintech unit which helps shopkeepers get working capital loans to buy inventory. That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says.

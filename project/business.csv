India Need Not Worry About Bangladesh-US Trade Deal: Former Envoy Veena Sikri

How much will zero tariffs on Bangladesh textiles hurt India?

The US-Bangladesh trade deal has the Indian textile sector exporters worried? The Donald Trump administration has reduced the tariffs on Bangladesh to 19%, but a clause of zero tariffs on textile exports may hit the Indian textile industry.But how hard will India be impacted? According to a recent report by Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI), the concession of zero tariffs to Bangladesh will not lead to a big surge in the country’s exports. The joint statement says the US will offer zero reciprocal tariff on garments which are made using US-origin cotton and man-made fibres.In practical terms, a Bangladeshi garment that normally faces a 12% US MFN tariff would attract a total duty of 31% (12% MFN + 19% reciprocal). For India, the comparable total would be about 30% (12% MFN + 18% reciprocal). But Bangladeshi garments made with US fibres would avoid the reciprocal duty, paying just the 12% MFN tariff, the GTRI report says.Also Read | Trump removes 25% penal tariff: What happens if India stops buying Russian crude oil? “While this appears to be a significant concession, Bangladesh’s export structure and its heavy dependence on non-US textile inputs mean the arrangement is likely to result in only a limited increase in garment exports to the U.S,” says Ajay Srivastava, founder of GTRI.In 2024, Bangladesh’s global garment exports were $50.9 billion, which is much higher than India’s $16.3 billion. More than 63% of Bangladesh’s exports were directed to the European Union, where shipments get duty-free access.Exports to the United States were $7.4 billion, with Bangladeshi garments continuing to face an average MFN tariff of about 12 percent after the withdrawal of US GSP benefits in 2019. Since the European Union remains Bangladesh’s primary market, its production and supply chains have largely evolved to cater to European demand and are unlikely to undergo rapid changes to comply with conditional US sourcing requirements, says GTRI.The structure of Bangladesh’s garment industry also reflects a strong dependence on imported raw materials. In 2024, the country imported fibres, yarns and fabrics worth $16.1 billion. China accounted for approximately $9 billion of these supplies, India for $3.1 billion, and the United States for only $274 million.At a more detailed level, the imbalance becomes clearer. Bangladesh imported cotton fibre worth $2.5 billion, with India supplying $655 million and Brazil $604 million, while imports from the United States were limited to $255 million.Also Read | 18% tariffs, boost to exports, agriculture protected: How India benefits from trade deal with US? Explained Cotton yarn imports totalled $1.8 billion, of which India alone accounted for $1.6 billion. In the case of fabrics, particularly woven synthetic filament fabrics that are critical for garment production, China remained the dominant supplier, providing $1.1 billion out of total imports valued at $1.4 billion, compared with just $88 million sourced from the United States.Out of total woven cotton fabric imports valued at $1.3 billion, China accounted for $601 million while India supplied $194 million. A similar trend is visible in synthetic filament yarn imports, where China contributed $329 million out of a total of $442 million, compared with $53 million from India.The significant share of yarn and fabric imports relative to fibre imports indicates that less than one-third of Bangladesh’s garments are produced starting from raw fibre. Most apparel manufacturing relies on imported yarns and fabrics rather than basic fibre inputs.The United States primarily supplies raw cotton to Bangladesh and that too in relatively small quantities, whereas India and China provide the yarns and fabrics that form the backbone of Bangladesh’s garment production.In order to benefit from zero-tariff access, Bangladesh would need to replace long-standing suppliers and make substantial investments in spinning and fabric-processing infrastructure, capacity that is currently limited, says GTRI.Since the European Union accounts for nearly two-thirds of Bangladesh’s garment exports and already provides unconditional duty-free access, the incentive to reorganise supply chains mainly to serve the US market remains limited.","The US-Bangladesh trade deal has the Indian textile sector exporters worried.

Bank strike today: Are banks shut amid nationwide Bharat bandh on February 12?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/bharat-bandh-today-are-banks-shut-amid-nationwide-strike-on-february-12/articleshow/128235136.cms,"Representative AI image

Will banks remain open today?

Which bank unions are participating — and why?

The nation is observing a Bharat Bandh on Thursday following a nationwide strike call by a joint forum of central trade unions against the Centre’s alleged anti-worker policies. The strike also involves banking unions.Thus, amid the strike, uncertainty looms over banking operations, with customers across cities unsure whether branches will function normally or face disruptions as several bank unions align with the strike call.While banks will remain open, services might face disruptions as major institutions like State Bank of India, Bank of Baroda , and UCO Bank have notified the BSE about potential service impacts during the Bharat Bandh.Bank of Baroda has informed customers through its BSE filing that while it is preparing for normal operations, branch services might be affected if the strike takes place. Similarly, SBI noted that although necessary arrangements have been made to ensure normal functioning, work in branches and offices may be impacted to a limited extent.UCO Bank made similar statements in its BSE filing, stating that steps are being taken for smooth operations but branch functioning could be affected if the strike materialises.For customers wondering about bank services on February 12, it is important to note that while banks are not officially closed, planning transactions in advance may help avoid inconvenience due to possible service limitations.Major bank unions including the All India Bank Employees' Association (AIBEA), All India Bank Officers Association (AIBOA), and Bank Employees Federation of India (BEFI) joined forces with 10 central trade unions for this protest. They have raised concerns over the new labour codes, alleging that the reforms are unfavourable to workers and could make trade union registration more restrictive.The protest also comes at a time when bank associations have been actively campaigning for improved working conditions, including the long-pending demand for a five-day work week to enhance work-life balance for employees.","The nation is observing a Bharat Bandh on Thursday following a nationwide strike call by a joint forum of central trade unions against the Centre’s alleged anti- worker policies.

Yes Securities has a buy recommendation on Amber Enterprises with the target price at Rs 8,962. Analysts said Amber Ent has started to witness strong traction as it has significantly increased its capabilities and is now focusing on value addition that will drive growth and margins. Railways business revenue is expected to double in the next two financial years. Considering strong April-Dec 2025 performance and continued execution excellence, the analysts have increased their earnings estimates for FY27 and FY28.ICICI Securities maintained its add rating on Titan with the target price at Rs 4,500. Analysts said that though Titan’s strong jewellery sales growth during Oct-Dec 2025 (Q3FY26) amid inflated gold price regime is primarily led by higher ticket sizes, it does unravel a relatively lower volume elasticity, suggesting resilient underlying demand. They believe margin sustenance within the normative range of 11-11.5% may be a key monitorable as high gold price-led margin dilution in the studded segment and higher coin salience could continue to weigh on jewellery margins. CaratLane continues to scale up well along with improving profitability. Watches and Eyecare witnessed strong sales growth, while emerging businesses sustained demand traction. Analysts said they remain cognizant of the fact that continued rise in gold prices could impact consumer behaviour/ business model.Motilal Oswal Securities reiterated its sell rating on Eicher Motors with the target price at Rs 6,313. Analysts said that the company’s robust domestic volume growth for Royal Enfield in FY26 so far has largely been a function of GST rate cut benefits. However, demand seems to have now normalized after an initial surge in pent-up demand. Further, given that management would continue to focus on ‘growth over profitability,’ it would mean that margin upside is likely to be capped from hereon. Given the expected slower earnings growth, analysts see no reason for the stock to trade at premium valuations.Emkay Global Financial Services has a buy rating on Star Cement with the target price raised to Rs 300 from Rs 280 earlier. Analysts said the company’s reported consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) was above the brokerage’s estimate due to higher-than-expected realization. Analysts like Star cement’s regional dominance and endeavour toward stretching its leadership over peers in the northeastern market. Further, entry into Rajasthan is likely to help it shed the tag of a regional player and establish its brand in North India too.Elara Securities has an accumulate rating on Lemon Tree Hotels with the target price at Rs 157. Analysts said Lemon Tree Hotels reported in-line operational performance. Asset addition pipeline continues to swell for the hospitality company, driven by managed hotels, but new hotel openings have been sluggish. Growth in the next two years will be driven by mix improvement at Aurika Mumbai, opening of the 91-key Aurika at Shimla in FY27, higher management fee income and double-digit RevPAR growth for the owned portfolio. LEMONTRE is the best stock to play on growth in the mid-market hotel segment but partial gains on profitability due to the industry upcycle are being eroded by recurring renovation expenses.","Yes Securities has a buy recommendation on Amber Enterprises with the target price at Rs 8,962.

Stock market today: Indian stock market indices, Nifty50 and BSE Sensex , tanked in opening trade on Thursday morning. While Nifty50 went below 25,900, BSE Sensex was down over 200 points.

BSE Sensex was at 83,998.41, down 235 points or 0.28%.Dr. VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Investments Limited says, “The latest US jobs data indicating addition of 1,30,000 jobs last month and unemployment falling to 4.3% points to the possibility of no rate cuts by the Fed in the near-term. In India, too, it appears that the rate cutting cycle is over since growth is good and inflation is expected to inch back to the RBI’s long-term target by the end of FY 27. Support to the market has to come from earnings growth, and there are sectors like automobiles, jewellery, hotels, segments of capital goods, telecom and financials that are doing well on the earnings front and have the potential to continue to do well.”“Tech stocks, reeling under the Anthropic shock, are unlikely to recover soon. The sharp dip in the ADRs of top Indian IT companies in the US yesterday, indicates that Indian IT will continue to struggle.The switch from IT to other segments will help performing stocks in performing sectors. The sharp rise in stocks like Eicher, Titan and Apollo Hospital in response to results indicate that the market will reward better-than-expected results. Even with occasional profit booking, the undertone of the market will remain resilient mainly because there is a trend of FIIs turning buyers. The fact that FIIs were buyers in six of the last seven trading sessions, indicates that at least the trend of sustained selling is over.

Looking Ahead

For more than three decades, the H-1B visa program has been a cornerstone of economic integration between India and the United States, enabling movement of highly skilled professionals into sectors critical to US productivity and innovation.Indian nationals account for more than 70% of all H-1B visas issued globally, making India the single largest beneficiary. This has delivered clear tangible benefits to US employers and Indian nationals.What was once a process characterized by relative predictability has, over the past year, evolved into prolonged uncertainty and anxiousness among Indian nationals. Extended visa stamping delays at US consulates in India have left thousands of H-1B holders stranded outside the United States far longer than anticipated.While the immigration consequences of these delays are widely discussed, the more complex and enduring implications might lie in personal & corporate taxation, social security, and payroll risks which need careful consideration.Appointment availability across US consulates across cities in India has squeezed dramatically. Applicants witnessed their already scheduled interview dates pushed into late 2026 and 2027 due to backlog and rescheduling.Visa stamping via third countries is also discouraged.The above reflects a convergence of post-pandemic demand recovery, surging application volumes, staffing constraints at diplomatic missions, annual lottery caps, requests for evidence, expanded security screening for employment-based visas, and reduced eligibility for interview-waiver (“drop-box”) processing.The US Department of State has announced that, effective December 15, 2025, all H-1B and H-4 applicants will be subject to expanded online-presence and social-media vetting. Applicants have been asked to make social-media profiles public, and consular officers may review publicly available posts, professional histories, connections, and any inconsistencies between online content and visa applications. The Department has explicitly stated that adjudication will rely on ‘all available information.’Additional vetting increases review time raises the likelihood of administrative processing and heightens the risk of follow-up interviews or document requests. For applicants who traveled expecting a short stay for a routine, compliance has transformed into an open-ended disruption, with return timelines getting increasingly difficult to predict.Stranded professionals continue working remotely from India for their US employers, if their tax position remains unchanged because their employment contracts, payroll, and reporting lines remain in the US This assumption may hold good for short, well-contained periods. As delays stretch into months and now even more than a year, it opens tax exposures.As per India income-tax laws, salary accrues in India for services being rendered in/from India, irrespective of where the employer is located or where remuneration is paid. As a result, salary attributable to days worked remotely from India may be treated as India-sourced income, even if paid into a US bank account by a US employer.The India–US Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (‘DTAA’ or ‘treaty’) offers potential relief. Article 16 provides a short-stay exemption under which employment income remains taxable solely in the country of residence if all the below conditions are met cumulatively.In case of breach of the 183-days threshold, coupled with history of stay pattern in India, ‘Resident and Ordinarily Resident’ status may trigger, which has larger ramifications of worldwide income taxation in India. Having said this, treaty relief mechanisms become more complex and administratively burdensome.From a US perspective, many H-1B holders remain US Tax residents under the substantial presence test despite prolonged physical absence, particularly where the absence is involuntary and the intent to return to USA is clear. As a result, US federal tax on worldwide income continues, and payroll withholding often remains unchanged. State tax residency may also persist depending on domicile and individual state rules.This creates a dual exposure scenario: Indian taxation based on source or residency, alongside US taxation based on residence. Although foreign tax credits are available in the US to mitigate double taxation, mismatches in tax years and timing of tax payments can lead to cash-flow strain and interim double taxation.The consequences extend beyond individual employees. From a payroll perspective, if an employee remains in India for fewer than 183 days and treaty exemption applies, India tax withholding may not be required, but the employer must be able to document the treaty position.Once presence exceeds the threshold mentioned above, Indian tax withholding obligations arise, often necessitating shadow payroll registration and compliance. Where payroll continues only in the United States without Indian reporting, employers may face audit by the tax authorities, even where employees have paid the necessary tax directly through advance tax route or tax return filings.Prolonged presence of employees in India—particularly those engaged in strategic roles such as business development, contract negotiations, client engagement or revenue generating roles—may trigger questions around permanent establishment risk exposure. Authorities may examine the aggregate presence of employees, the nature of their responsibilities, and whether a fixed place of business exists in substance.Social security adds another layer of complexity. There is no comprehensive India- US social security totalization agreement.FICA withholding continues in the US, while Indian provident fund obligations may arise if the US entity has twenty or more employees stranded in India at any point in time. Dual contribution risk, though often impractical to resolve, becomes a real consideration in extended delay scenarios.What distinguishes the current H-1B backlog from traditional mobility is that the risk exposure arises without intent. Employees did not elect to relocate their work location, and employers did not redesign secondment models. Yet both are required to navigate tax, payroll, social security, and corporate tax frameworks that assume advance planning and conscious structuring.As expanded vetting under Department of State rules comes into effect from December 2025, the likelihood of longer consular processing times increases. This, in turn, raises the probability that temporary travel turns into extended remote work, with cascading tax consequences across jurisdictions.As H-1B delays persist, the issue warrants attention beyond immigration policy alone. During covid times, such unprecedented delays caused similar tax complexities. The Indian government back then for a very limited period provided for a window to make an application to ‘not consider additional stay in India beyond the individual’s control to determine the tax residential status.The artificial barriers being created to obstruct talent fungibility might impact US Companies reliance on Indian talent - or will it lead businesses to begin moving towards talent rich geographies like India?","The H-1B visa program has been a cornerstone of economic integration between India and the United States. Indian nationals account for more than 70% of all H- 1B visas issued globally, making India the single largest beneficiary. Extended visa stamping delays at US consulates in India have left thousands of H1B holders stranded.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128106708,imgsize-49172,width-400,resizemode-4/h-1b-visa.jpg"

Cess and surcharge money spent to benefit states: FM Sitharaman,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/cess-and-surcharge-money-spent-to-benefit-states-fm-sitharaman/articleshow/128233421.cms,"NEW DELHI: Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Wednesday rejected the criticism by states over cesses and surcharges, arguing that it was in line with the Constitutional provisions and the money collected through these levies was spent on schemes that benefited the states.While responding to the discussion on the Budget in the Lok Sabha, FM said that states should distinguish between the gross tax revenue and the net proceeds that are legally shareable. “States can’t have it both ways. The states should check if the entire net proceeds which form the divisible pool, after removing cess and surcharge from gross tax revenue, is received by them,” she said.The minister said that the Centre was transferring 41% to the states, as was recommended by the Finance Commission. “The 16th Finance Commission analysed the state’s share transferred by the Centre to the states from 2018-19 to 2022-23, and concluded that in each of these years, the devolution made by the Centre exactly matches the recommendation of the Finance Commission. So, we are not the only ones claiming this… There is no scope for any doubt in this for the states,” the minister said.Sitharaman also criticised states such as West Bengal, where Mamata Banerjee’s TMC was in power, arguing that they blamed the Centre for GST , but then imposed additional burden on consumers. “The state govt in West Bengal imposes road levies and charges taxes at the time of new vehicle registration.If there is so much concern about GST burdening citizens, then why impose additional state-level taxes? These could be waived for the people of Bengal, but instead, GST collections are criticised while state taxes continue to be levied,” she said while accusing Abhishek Banerjee of twisting facts on GST.She said govt is incentivising data centres in the country, in what was a rebuttal to Rahul Gandhi’s claims on Indian data. Further, she listed out measures on SEZs, customs reforms and support to MSMEs to counter Rahul’s concerns. “Leader of the Opposition expressed concerns over geopolitics, energy and weaponisation of finance.

"RBI strengthens mis-selling norms, full refund if proven",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/rbi-strengthens-mis-selling-norms-full-refund-if-proven/articleshow/128233189.cms,"MUMBAI: Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has sharply tightened the definition of mis-selling, removing one of the biggest defences used by banks and insurance companies that the customer had explicitly consented by signing documents. Under the new framework, regulated entities will also have to make full refunds in cases of proven mis-selling.In the Draft Reserve Bank of India (Commercial Banks - Responsible Business Conduct) Amendment Directions, 2026, RBI has defined mis-selling as the sale of a product or service that is inappropriate for a customer's profile-age, income level or risk appetite, even if the customer gave explicit consent.The central bank has also, for the first time, defined ""dark patterns"" in financial sales. These refer to deceptive user experience designs on digital platforms that mislead or trick customers into actions they did not intend, by impairing their autonomy or choice, and amount to misleading advertising, unfair trade practices or violation of consumer rights.For years, banks and insurers have followed a buyer-beware approach, often citing signed fact sheets and confirmation calls to defend themselves in disputes, particularly in cases involving complex insurance or investment products sold to senior citizens.By stating that customer consent does not legitimise an unsuitable sale, RBI has effectively held banks to the principle of utmost good faith, making them accountable for the appropriateness of products they distribute rather than treating them as mere commission-driven intermediaries. RBI has also indicated that regulated entities must have a policy in place for customer compensation, including full refunds in established cases.The draft rules further prohibit compulsory bundling, making it clear that loan approvals cannot be linked to the purchase of insurance or other financial products.They also tighten oversight of third-party agents, requiring banks to display updated lists of all Direct Selling Agents on their websites and ensure that agents operating within branches are clearly distinguishable from bank employees.Industry executives said the norms, scheduled to take effect from July 1, 2026, are likely to major overhaul in the way insurance and investment products are sold through bank branches.","The central bank has also, for the first time, defined ""dark patterns"" in financial sales.

WTO DG Okonjo-Iweala Lauds India’s Trade Strategy, Calls For Multilateral Leadership

The World Trade Organization (WTO) needs urgent structural reform as the global trading system undergoes rapid economic and technological shifts, WTO Director-General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala said, warning that maintaining the current framework is no longer viable, AFP reported.Speaking in Geneva on Wednesday, Okonjo-Iweala said the global trade body and the broader multilateral system are at a decisive moment. “We are meeting today at an inflection point, not just for the WTO, but... for the multilateral system,” she said, adding that failure to preserve the global trading framework could trigger instability.“I don't think the status quo is an option,” she said.Reform is expected to be a central agenda item at the WTO ministerial meeting scheduled in Cameroon next month.The WTO, which governs large parts of global trade flows, has been facing operational challenges due to its consensus-based decision-making structure and a dispute settlement mechanism that has been weakened amid tensions with the United States. The organisation has also faced growing geopolitical pressures, which intensified after US President Donald Trump returned to the White House last year and trade tensions escalated.Okonjo-Iweala stressed that global institutions must evolve alongside rapid technological and economic transformation. “The world is moving so fast... If you look at the speed at which technology is moving, and AI is moving and quantum technologies are moving,” she said.“If your organisation doesn't adapt, then you'll be left behind,” she added.Highlighting the WTO’s role in providing trade certainty, she said the system continues to remain foundational despite growing challenges. “This organisation provides stability and predictability,” she said, adding that “in spite of all the knocks, it is still the bedrock for so much of world trade”.She cautioned that a breakdown of the multilateral trading framework would create widespread uncertainty for businesses and global commerce.“If we don't have this system, what does it mean? I'll be very honest with you: there'll be chaos,” she said.“It means a business will send goods somewhere without the knowledge of how those goods will be valued when it arrives at customs... you wouldn't know how your goods will be valued before you're tariffed. You wouldn't know whether you're going to make money or not.”“You'll be confronted when your goods arrive with rules that you were never aware of,” she added.",WTO Director-General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala says the global trading system is at an 'inflection point' She warns that a breakdown of the multilateral trading framework would create widespread uncertainty for businesses.

Rate-cut bets strengthen, bond yields fall

Mixed earnings keep stocks in check

Wall Street stocks traded near record levels on Tuesday as investors digested weak US retail sales data and a mixed set of corporate earnings, boosting expectations that the Federal Reserve could cut interest rates later this year.The S&P 500 was marginally higher, briefly sitting just above its all-time high, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose around 0.4 per cent to hover near record territory. The Nasdaq Composite also edged up slightly.According to news agency AFP, markets were largely indecisive early in the session as traders balanced concerns about slowing consumer spending with optimism over possible monetary easing.US retail sales data showed no growth in December, missing economists’ expectations and raising concerns about the momentum of the world’s largest economy.Shoppers spent roughly the same in December as in November, signalling potential weakness in household demand, which is the main engine of US economic growth, as per AP.The softer retail data pushed Treasury yields lower, with the benchmark 10-year yield falling to around 4.13 per cent from 4.22 per cent a day earlier, reported news agency AP.Traders also increased bets that the Federal Reserve could cut interest rates three times or more this year, according to CME Group data, though most still expect two cuts.The retail sales report comes ahead of key US data releases later this week, including unemployment figures on Wednesday and inflation numbers on Friday. These updates are expected to play a crucial role in shaping the Fed’s interest rate outlook.While stubborn inflation could keep rates higher for longer, signs of labour market weakness may prompt quicker easing.CFRA Research’s Sam Stovall said the data could strengthen the case for additional rate cuts but warned investors must balance this against “the possibility of an economic slowdown”.Corporate earnings offered a mixed picture. Coca-Cola shares slipped after the company reported quarterly revenue growth that fell short of expectations and issued a cautious outlook.S&P Global tumbled after giving a weaker-than-expected profit forecast, amid concerns about competition from AI-driven rivals.In contrast, Hasbro jumped after beating profit and revenue estimates and announcing plans to return up to $1 billion to shareholders through share buybacks.DuPont also gained after posting stronger-than-expected quarterly results and issuing an upbeat profit outlook for 2026.Outside the US, Japan’s Nikkei 225 surged more than 2 per cent to a fresh record, driven by expectations that a newly elected parliament will support tax cuts and pro-growth measures.Other Asian markets saw modest gains, while European indices traded mixed.Overall, markets remained supported by hopes of lower interest rates, even as investors weighed signs of a cooling US economy against resilient corporate performance.","The S&P 500 was marginally higher, briefly sitting just above its all-time high.

Bangladesh commerce secretary Mahbubur Rahman and assistant US trade representative Brendan Lynch were also present.Speaking on the agreement, Greer said, “Under President Trump's leadership, the United States is pursuing a trade policy that delivers real results for American workers and businesses, strengthening our economic and security partnerships abroad.” He further added, “today's signing of the Agreement on Reciprocal Trade with Bangladesh is the first in South Asia and marks a meaningful step forward in opening markets, addressing trade barriers, and creating new opportunities for American exporters. ”Bangladesh's chief adviser Muhammad Yunus said that the agreement indicates a “historically new level” in relations between the two nations.The latest deal also reduces the reciprocal tariff from the initial figure of 37% and the 20% that had been in place since August last year.As part of the deal, Washington has also committed to establish a pathway for certain textile and apparel shipments from Bangladesh made with US cotton and man-made fibre to enter the United States at a zero reciprocal tariff.“The reduction of reciprocal tariff will grant further advantage to our exporters, while zero reciprocal tariff on specific textile and apparel exports from Bangladesh using US inputs will give substantial added impetus to our garments sector”, said NSA Rahman, Bangladesh’s chief negotiator.Dhaka said that the agreement was approved by the council of advisers approved and the pact will come into force once both governments issue formal notifications.","Under the arrangement, Bangladesh’s exports to the American market will face a 19% tariff, slightly below the earlier rate of 20%.

US President Donald Trump sees the US stock market doubling from here by the end of his term. Praising the first year of his second term, Trump expressed confidence that the stock market could double within the next two years after the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed above the 50,000 mark for the first time on Friday.Posting on Truth Social during the Super Bowl on Sunday night, Trump attributed the Dow Jones’ milestone to what he believes are strong tariffs and national security policies. He said he expected the Dow to reach 100,000 by the time his term concludes, adding that he hoped the United States Supreme Court was observing developments. This comment is widely being interpreted as a message urging the court not to interfere with his tariff agenda.""Record Stock Market, and National Security, driven by our Great TARIFFS. I am predicting 100,000 on the DOW by the end of my Term.REMEMBER, TRUMP WAS RIGHT ABOUT EVERYTHING! I hope the United States Supreme Court is watching,” he posted on Truth Social.Trump has repeatedly argued that his tariff policies have helped rebalance global trade, contributed to international stability, and boosted economic prosperity in the United States through increased revenue from abroad.Trump has repeatedly argued that his tariff policies have helped rebalance global trade, contributed to international stability, and boosted economic prosperity in the United States through increased revenue from abroad. He also pointed to an estimated 5.4% expansion in gross domestic product in the previous quarter, despite what he described as a record-long government shutdown driven by Democrats.According to his remarks, the shutdown was carried out under the banner of healthcare reform that ultimately did not materialise, with conservatives claiming it was intended as a political move against him. He further stated that Senate Democrats triggered another shutdown toward the end of last month and could potentially cause another if funding for the Department of Homeland Security is not approved before the February 13 deadline later this week.The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed above the 50,000 level for the first time on Friday. This marked a historic milestone for the blue-chip index as investors increasingly shifted toward non-technology stocks this year.The index climbed 1,206.95 points, or 2.47%, to settle at 50,115.67 at the close of trading. The strong gain reflects continued momentum in the Dow, which has outperformed other major Wall Street benchmarks so far this year.Market participants have increasingly turned to stocks outside the technology sector, supporting the index’s advance and helping drive its year-to-date rise. The Dow has gained 4.3% since the beginning of the year.","US President Donald Trump sees the US stock market doubling from here by the end of his term.

The Federal Trade Commission requires products labelled as American-made to contain no foreign content, a standard that is difficult to meet given the globalised supply chain of smartphone components.Instead, production is being handled by what executives described as a “favored nation”, while a limited “final assembly” stage is expected to take place in Miami. The Verge reported this final assembly may involve putting together roughly the last set of components before shipment.The device is currently undergoing carrier certification with T-Mobile, which is expected to be completed around mid-March, after which sales could begin. Trump Mobile is also preparing to relaunch its website with updated product images and full specifications.The redesigned T1 will feature a larger display, now closer to 6.8 inches compared with the earlier 6.25-inch version. The report said the device will use a Qualcomm Snapdragon 7-series chipset, paired with 512GB internal storage expandable up to 1TB via microSD.Camera specifications are also being upgraded, with both the front camera and main rear sensor expected to be 50MP.

The Washington Post's publisher and CEO Will Lewis resigned on Saturday, just days after laying off 300 journalists. His sudden departure comes amid strong criticism from staff over his handling of the newspaper's financial troubles and recent mass layoffs. Jeff D'Onofrio, the company's CFO, will take over as acting publisher and CEO immediately.Lewis announced his exit in a brief note to staff, thanking owner Jeff Bezos and claiming the ""difficult decisions"" were needed for the Post's future. “After two years of transformation at The Washington Post, now is the right time for me to step aside,” Lewis wrote Saturday in a brief note to staff. “I want to thank Jeff Bezos for his support and leadership throughout my tenure as CEO and Publisher. The institution could not have a better owner,"" he added.Further continuing his message he added, “During my tenure, difficult decisions have been taken in order to ensure the sustainable future of The Post so it can for many years ahead publish high-quality nonpartisan news to millions of customers each day.""However, Lewis' leadership came with controversies, according to CNN. Even during the Wednesday layoffs, his absence and subsequent appearance at a Super Bowl event in San Francisco reportedly caused anger.The Washington Post announced what it called a “significant restructuring” of its operations, including the closure of its standalone Sports desk and a reduction in its international reporting presence. According to Fox News, roughly a third of the organisation’s workforce which is nearly 300 employees were affected.Bezos broke his silence since the layoffs, stating in a statement that ""The Post has an essential journalistic mission and an extraordinary opportunity."" He expressed confidence in the new leadership team of D'Onofrio, executive editor Matt Murray, and Opinion editor Adam O'Neal.Lewis's 15-month tenure was rocky from the start. He joined in November 2023 after working at The Wall Street Journal and within Rupert Murdoch's media empire. His reputation took hits when NPR reported his alleged involvement in covering up a phone-hacking scandal at Murdoch's UK tabloids, which he denied. He also reportedly tried to stop NPR from publishing that story.The Washington Post Guild responded to Lewis's departure with sharp criticism. ""His legacy will be the attempted destruction of a great American journalism institution,"" the union said, calling on Bezos to reverse the layoffs or sell the paper to someone willing to invest in its future.Despite attempts to improve the Post's business side and develop new revenue streams, Lewis struggled to win over the newsroom. His decision to fire executive editor Sally Buzbee and his handling of the recent layoffs, where he was notably absent from communicating with staff, further damaged his standing with employees.","The Washington Post's publisher and CEO Will Lewis resigned on Saturday.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.","Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain.

The Series A funding round was led by Lightspeed Venture Partners, and participants included Silicon Valley billionaire Vinod Khosla’s Khosla Ventures and Peak XV Partners, formerly Sequoia Capital India & Southeast Asia, Sarvam said Thursday.The Bangalore-based startup, until recently in stealth mode, was co-founded by Vivek Raghavan and Pratyush Kumar. It has ambitious plans to build open source foundational AI systems as well as tools for creating apps for the meager compute infrastructure available to developers in India. The startup has a total of 18 employees and is just opening an office in the city.""What we are showing is that you can build large language models with limited resources,” Raghavan said in a phone interview. ""We are building at a smaller scale and demonstrating that these can be extremely cost and energy efficient so they can be accessed by everyone.""Large language models, like OpenAI’s GPT-4 and Meta Platforms Inc.’s Llama, are powerful AI systems that understand by learning from vast amounts of diverse data from the internet and elsewhere to summarize, translate, and create text, audio and video for a wide range of applications.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor (CEA) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September.

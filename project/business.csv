Central government employees and pensioners have reason to cheer with the website for the 8th Pay Commission going live, seeking feedback and inputs from concerned individuals.The 8th Pay Commission was first announced in January 2025, and it was formally notified later through a Ministry of Finance notification issued on November 3, 2025.

With the launch of the website, the 8th Pay Commission has now invited suggestions and feedback from ministries, departments, central government employees, and other stakeholders.In a statement published on the new website, the Commission said it is seeking views, opinions, and inputs to help it make well-informed recommendations.

He said that the government would decide when the 8th Central Pay Commission recommendations would come into effect and that suitable financial provisions would be made once the recommendations accepted by the government are implemented.According to Ramachandran Krishnamoorthy, Director – Payroll Services at Nexdigm, arrears under the 8th Pay Commission may be estimated by multiplying the difference in monthly salary by the number of months for which implementation is delayed.The revised pay is calculated by applying the approved fitment factor to an employee’s existing basic pay under the 7th Pay Commission.Krishnamoorthy explained that arrears generally consist of:The overall arrears amount depends on the duration of the delay, which could typically range between 18 and 24 months.","The 8th Pay Commission was first announced in January 2025, and it was formally notified later through a Ministry of Finance notification issued on November 3, 2025.

‘Historically new level’: US cuts tariffs on Bangladeshi goods to 19% under new trade deal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/historically-new-level-us-cuts-tariffs-on-bangladeshi-goods-to-19-under-new-trade-deal/articleshow/128136753.cms,"After India Breaks Trump's Tariff Wall, Bangladesh Moves Fast On A Hidden US Pact Under Interim Rule

The United States and Bangladesh on Monday reached an Agreement on Reciprocal Trade as both sides seek to deepen their “bilateral economic relationship”. Under the arrangement, Bangladesh’s exports to the American market will face a 19% tariff, slightly below the earlier rate of 20%.The signing brought together US trade representative Jamieson Greer and Bangladesh’s adviser overseeing commerce, textiles and jute, and civil aviation and tourism, Sheikh Bashir Uddin. Bangladesh commerce secretary Mahbubur Rahman and assistant US trade representative Brendan Lynch were also present.Speaking on the agreement, Greer said, “Under President Trump's leadership, the United States is pursuing a trade policy that delivers real results for American workers and businesses, strengthening our economic and security partnerships abroad.” He further added, “today's signing of the Agreement on Reciprocal Trade with Bangladesh is the first in South Asia and marks a meaningful step forward in opening markets, addressing trade barriers, and creating new opportunities for American exporters. ”Bangladesh's chief adviser Muhammad Yunus said that the agreement indicates a “historically new level” in relations between the two nations.The latest deal also reduces the reciprocal tariff from the initial figure of 37% and the 20% that had been in place since August last year.As part of the deal, Washington has also committed to establish a pathway for certain textile and apparel shipments from Bangladesh made with US cotton and man-made fibre to enter the United States at a zero reciprocal tariff.“The reduction of reciprocal tariff will grant further advantage to our exporters, while zero reciprocal tariff on specific textile and apparel exports from Bangladesh using US inputs will give substantial added impetus to our garments sector”, said NSA Rahman, Bangladesh’s chief negotiator.Dhaka said that the agreement was approved by the council of advisers approved and the pact will come into force once both governments issue formal notifications.","Under the arrangement, Bangladesh’s exports to the American market will face a 19% tariff, slightly below the earlier rate of 20%.

Gold price prediction today: Gold prices are likely to remain volatile this week, says Manav Modi, Senior Analyst, Commodity Research at Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd. The expert shares his outlook for gold prices in the near term:Gold and silver witnessed another volatile yet constructive last week, with prices rebounding sharply after aggressive liquidation at the start of this month, as forced unwinding eased and value buying emerged across both metals. The earlier correction—triggered by a sharp dollar rebound, shifting Fed expectations, easing geopolitical risk premiums and heavy speculative positioning—appears to have run its course for now, allowing bullion to stabilise and recover.Gold rebounded decisively from the ₹141,000 zone, forming a clear V-shaped recovery on daily charts, while prices continue to sustain well above the key momentum pivot of ₹138,000, keeping the broader trend positive. Bollinger Bands, which had compressed during the correction, have begun to expand again with prices moving towards the upper band, signalling a revival in directional strength supported by improving volumes.Immediate support for gold is seen near ₹150,000 followed by ₹143,000, while the earlier target of ₹155,000 has been achieved; any sustained close above this level could open the path towards ₹165,000 and ₹171,000 from a short to medium-term perspective.Despite a relatively firm dollar and lingering policy uncertainty, safe-haven demand remains underpinned by central-bank buying, renewed geopolitical and fiscal concerns. Domestically, a rebound in USDINR from recent lows has lent support to MCX prices.Markets will remain sensitive this week to US inflation, retail sales, PMI data and the delayed non-farm payrolls release, along with policy commentary, which are likely to keep intraday swings sharp even as the broader bullion bias stays supportive.","Gold prices are likely to remain volatile this week, says Manav Modi, Senior Analyst, Commodity Research at Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd.

Stock market today: Indian benchmark indices, Nifty50 and BSE Sensex , rose in early trade on Tuesday continuing the ongoing rally post the India-US trade deal announcement. While Nifty50 went above 25,900, BSE Sensex was up over 150 points. At 9:16 AM, Nifty50 was trading at 25,918.55, up 51 points or 0.20%. BSE Sensex was at 84,232.68, up 167 points or 0.20%.Experts are of the view that in the near-term, the market direction is likely to depend on global macroeconomic trends, currency movements and the durability of risk appetite reflected in foreign institutional investment flows.Dr. VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Investments Limited says, “Tailwinds for the market are getting stronger with each passing day. Growth prospects for the economy are getting better than earlier optimistic estimates. A significant macro development is the turnaround in private capex, which has been sluggish for years. The H1 FY 26 numbers of a sample of listed companies compiled by BS show a 13.1% YoY increase in fixed assets. This is a clear indication of acceleration in private capex and this data is complemented by the recent up tick in bank credit.In brief, these macro developments can lead to GDP growth of above 7% and with inflation rising to expected 4% in FY27, this can translate into nominal GDP growth of around 10.5 % and corporate earnings growth of above 16%. The market will start discounting these positive developments, particularly since the US-India trade deal is no longer a constraint for the market. Financials have the potential to outperform in the rally while IT might continue to disappoint weighed down by the Anthropic shock. The outperformance of the broader market, particularly the recovery of the smallcaps will add to the enthusiasm of the retail investors enabling the market to remain resilient.""Asian markets extended their gains and climbed to fresh record levels as a rebound in US technology stocks gathered momentum. The recovery in tech shares helped ease investor concerns that had earlier emerged over elevated spending on artificial intelligence, providing support to broader market sentiment across the region.In US stock markets, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq posted strong gains after a volatile start to the week. Technology stocks regained stability following last week’s selloff linked to artificial intelligence-related concerns, while investors remained focused on upcoming economic data expected to offer signals on the Federal Reserve’s future interest rate trajectory.Gold and silver prices declined as the US dollar strengthened from a more than one-week low, with investors awaiting key employment and inflation data from the United States later in the week for further clarity on the outlook for interest rates.","Nifty50 went above 25,900, BSE Sensex was up over 150 points.

Provident Fund withdrawals via UPI soon! New EPFO app to have several subscriber-friendly features; check details,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/wealth/retirement-planning/provident-fund-withdrawals-via-upi-soon-new-epfo-app-to-have-several-subscriber-friendly-features-check-details/articleshow/128113030.cms,"Representative image generated by AI (Gemini)

New app to add UPI withdrawal



Reducing claim delays and improving access



In a move aimed at modernising retirement fund access, EPFO is working on a new mobile application that may allow subscribers to withdraw a portion of their EPF savings instantly through the UPI payment gateway. The app, expected to be launched around April, is part of efforts to reduce claim processing time and improve digital service delivery, sources told PTI.The labour ministry is working on a project where a certain proportion of EPF will be frozen, while a large portion will be available for withdrawal through bank accounts using Unified Payments Interface (UPI), the source said.The Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation is set to roll out a new dedicated mobile application through which members will be able to withdraw EPF money using the UPI gateway and access services such as passbook balance, the source said.Currently, members use the Universal Account Number (UAN) portal or the UMANG app to access EPF services. The source said these platforms will continue to function, while the new app is expected to further improve accessibility and service delivery for subscribers.Subscribers will be able to view the eligible EPF balance available for transfer to their seeded bank accounts through the mobile application. They will be able to use their linked UPI PIN to complete transactions, ensuring secure transfer of funds to bank accounts.The EPFO is currently conducting trials using 100 dummy accounts to improve system efficiency and remove possible technical glitches. The labour ministry is likely to launch the new app with a major rollout event in April, the source said.At present, EPFO members must file withdrawal claims to access EPF money, a process that can be time-consuming. Under the auto-settlement mode, claims are settled electronically without manual intervention within three days of filing the application.The auto-settlement withdrawal limit has already been increased to Rs 5 lakh from Rs 1 lakh earlier, allowing members to access funds faster for illness, education, marriage and housing purposes.EPFO, which has about 8 crore members, first introduced online auto-settlement of advance claims during the COVID-19 pandemic to help members facing financial stress. However, members still need to file claims to access EPF funds.The new system is being developed to eliminate this time-consuming process and reduce the operational burden on EPFO, which settles over 5 crore claims annually, mostly related to EPF withdrawals.The source said EPFO cannot allow direct withdrawal from EPF accounts because it does not have banking licences, but the government aims to upgrade EPFO services to match banking-level convenience.","EPFO is working on a new mobile application that may allow subscribers to withdraw a portion of their EPF savings instantly.

US and Bangladesh strike new trade deal — key terms of the agreement,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-and-bangladesh-strike-new-trade-deal-key-terms-of-the-agreement/articleshow/128138647.cms,"After India Breaks Trump's Tariff Wall, Bangladesh Moves Fast On A Hidden US Pact Under Interim Rule

Key terms of the agreement



Perks for Bangladesh: Washington will reduce the reciprocal tariff imposed under Executive Order 14257 to 19% on Bangladeshi goods. In addition, selected products listed in Annex III of Executive Order 14346 will qualify for a zero-tariff rate. The United States has committed to creating a mechanism under which certain textile and apparel products from Bangladesh can qualify for a zero reciprocal tariff rate. Under this arrangement, a yet-to-be-finalised volume of garments and textile imports from Bangladesh will be allowed to enter the US at the reduced rate. The permitted volume will depend on Bangladesh’s imports of American textile inputs, such as US-produced cotton and man-made fibres, effectively tying the benefit to the level of US exports.

Perks for US: Bangladesh will grant wide preferential entry to US industrial and agricultural products, covering chemicals, medical devices, machinery, automobiles and components, ICT equipment, energy supplies, soy items, dairy, beef, poultry, nuts and fruit.

Both governments will seek to remove Bangladeshi non-tariff barriers affecting trade and investment. Measures include recognising vehicles meeting US federal safety and emission rules, accepting US Food and Drug Administration certificates and prior approvals for pharmaceuticals and medical devices, and ending import restrictions or licensing on US remanufactured products and parts.

Bangladesh will enable trusted cross-border data flows, support a lasting WTO ban on customs duties for electronic transmissions, rely on science- and risk-based systems for safe American food and farm imports, open up the insurance sector, digitise customs and adopt sound regulatory practices.

Commitments have also been made on labour. Bangladesh will act to uphold internationally recognised rights, prohibit imports made through forced or compulsory labour, amend legislation to secure freedom of association and collective bargaining, and tighten enforcement.

Dhaka has pledged to maintain strong environmental safeguards, implement its environmental laws, improve trade facilitation at the border and tackle market distortions linked to subsidies and state-owned firms. Furthermore, the South Asian giant has committed to reinforce and apply comprehensive anti-corruption legislation.

On intellectual property, Bangladesh will pursue tougher protection and enforcement, including ratifying or joining certain global treaties. It will also introduce provisions on geographical indications aimed at ensuring continued US market access, particularly for producers of cheese and meat that use common names.

The two countries intend to align more closely on economic and national security matters, strengthening supply chains and innovation while working together against unfair trade practices, duty evasion, export control risks and by exchanging information on inbound investment.

American agencies such as the Export-Import Bank and the US International Development Finance Corporation may, where eligible and in accordance with law, look at backing investment in priority Bangladeshi sectors alongside US private firms.

The two countries also acknowledged recent and upcoming commercial agreements spanning agriculture, energy and technology. These include the procurement of aircraft, the purchase of around $3.5 billion worth of American agricultural commodities such as wheat, soy, cotton and corn, and energy imports estimated to be valued at $15 billion over the next 15 years.

The United States and Bangladesh on Monday finalised the United States–Bangladesh Agreement on Reciprocal Trade, wrapping up negotiations as both countries stepped in to strengthen bilateral economic ties. Under the revised framework, Bangladeshi exports to the American market will attract a 19% tariff, marginally lower than the 20% imposed in August and significantly below the original reciprocal rate of 37%.The agreement was signed by US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and Bangladesh’s Adviser for Commerce, Textiles and Jute, and Civil Aviation and Tourism, Sheikh Bashir Uddin, in the presence of Bangladesh Commerce Secretary Mahbubur Rahman and Assistant US Trade Representative Brendan Lynch.Both sides said they would proceed promptly, following their respective internal processes, to complete formalities required for the Agreement on Reciprocal Trade to take effect.","The United States and Bangladesh on Monday finalised the United States–Bangladesh Agreement on Reciprocal Trade.

"Industry split, govt reviews import policy on refurbished med devices",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/industry-split-govt-reviews-import-policy-on-refurbished-med-devices/articleshow/128134480.cms,"NEW DELHI: As India pushes ahead with bilateral trade agreements, the issue of importing refurbished medical equipment has emerged as a contentious flashpoint in the medical devices sector. Domestic players have warned against easing restrictions, flagging patient safety risks and concerns over unfair competition, while MNCs are advocating a globally-aligned framework to allow wider access to refurbished devices under stringent regulatory oversight.Recently, the health ministry constituted a committee to frame a policy for imported refurbished med devices, raising concerns among domestic players. Industry sources said the debate has intensified alongside India-US trade talks. ""The push has come into sharper focus as India negotiates a trade deal with US, which could include market access for such med devices over next few years,"" they told TOI.Total imports of medical devices last year stood at Rs 76,000 crore. Of this, Rs 48,000 crore are med electronics, with an estimated one-third being illegal pre-owned medical equipment.Such imports without any regulatory oversight have been ongoing for years, industry experts told TOI.Domestic industry body, Association of Indian Medical Device Industry (AiMeD) has opposed the move to relax policy restrictions on importing refurbished medical equipment, saying its highly unsafe for patients in the absence of inadequate calibration.""In case of locally-made devices, refurbished imports should only be allowed with a robust, enforceable regulatory framework benchmarked to global standards. Refurbished devices pose risks from unknown histories, inconsistent performance, limited traceability, and shortened lifespans. India must prioritise new, indigenously-manufactured devices under 'Make in India', and the Medical Devices Policy, rather than becoming a dumping ground for end-of-life equipment,"" Rajiv Nath, Forum Coordinator, AiMeD said.Rival firm, Medical Technology Association of India welcomed the govt move. ""As India actively pursues FTAs, we urge the adoption of a time-bound, globally aligned policy. Such a framework should permit the use of refurbished devices only when managed through original equipment manufacturers, ensuring clear legal accountability, robust service support and stringent patient safeguards,"" its chairman Pavan Choudary said.BPL's growth under PLI demands rejection of these imports, said Sunil Khurana, executive chairman, BPL Medical.

"As Centaur awaits end, Leela takes over Srinagar property",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/as-centaur-awaits-end-leela-takes-over-srinagar-property/articleshow/128133484.cms,"NEW DELHI: One of the two last remaining Centaur Hotels — the brand run by Hotel Corp of India, a subsidiary of erstwhile state-owned Air India — has found a saviour and is now looking at a fresh lease of life in a new avatar. The Leela Palaces, Hotels and Resorts has taken over the Centaur Srinagar, a picturesque property on the banks of Dal Lake, for a period of 60 years. The other Centaur, at Delhi Airport, however, is languishing in its last last remaining six years of existence with more than half of its 378 rooms unusable, awaiting demolition after March 2032.Anuraag Bhatnagar, Leela’s whole-time director & CEO, told TOI: “We are doing a Rs 300-crore capex on Centaur Srinagar. Extensive work is on at the site, which is the biggest hospitality sector project in Kashmir right now. The property, which used to have 220 keys, will open by the end of next year with 170 bigger rooms as a Leela. We are going to have Leela branded houseboats too, in a first for this place.”He added: “India is at the beginning of a multi-decadal cycle of luxury. The 7 crore households currently targeted by luxury players are expected to triple by 2030.While demand for luxury hospitality is growing in double digits, there is very little supply addition in the space.”Leela currently has 13 properties operational and sees this number rising to 23 by March 2030. It is in the midst of Rs 1,300-crore capex at five places — Agra, Ayodhya, Srinagar, Bandhavgarh and Ranthambore — for opening hotels with 1,000 keys in these places. Additionally, Leela is building a greenfield Leela Palace in BKC, Mumbai, which is 50% owned by it & 50% by Brookfield.“Our investment in the upcoming 250-key BKC property that will open in 2029 is Rs 800 crore. BKC has a serious demand for luxury hotels and hasn’t seen any new property in years. Excavation for that property will start this June,” Bhatnagar said. The group, which is going to have its first property abroad in Dubai, is also working on hotels in places like Sikkim and Jaisalmer.Unlike most other hospitality chains that are going asset light by going in for management contracts to expand footprint, Brookfield-backed Leela will own 12 of the hotels, which means more than half of the 23 hotels expected by 2030 will be owned by it. Asked the reason for this, Bhatnagar said: “We are generating very high returns and very high profit margins in our owned assets. This way we are creating value for stakeholders. ” The group keeps getting “inbound requests for assets”, meaning owners wanting to convert their properties to Leela.Meanwhile, back to the last remaining Centaur at Delhi Airport. Just before Covid struck, govt had in Dec 2019 allowed the dilapidated 1982-era Centaur Delhi to remain operational till March 31, 2032. The property is to be demolished after that and the area be used for expanding airport facilities. However, with no capex given the short remaining time period for recovering the same, the once iconic property remembered for its glass lifts & central hall is like a terminally ill patient in his last days, waiting for the end.","The Leela Palaces, Hotels and Resorts has taken over the Centaur Srinagar for a period of 60 years.

Regulatory filings over the past three Dec quarters point to a brief uptick after 2023-24, followed by a blip this year.""Coforge's growth has been driven by strong BFSI exposure, large deal wins and better offshore leverage. Persistent continues to benefit from product engineering, cloud modernisation and embedded AI work tied to revenue-generating transformation rather than cost takeout.

BNP Paribas noted that AI-driven platform and tooling engagements enabled a margin lift, backing the company's 200-basis-point expansion target by the next financial year.The broader engineering services segment remains under pressure.

Eligible seniors can authorise banks to compute and deduct tax. The number of fields are reduced by about 46%, and many seniors may no longer need to file returns.So, for those without a PAN, say your kid, which required filing of Form 60 for 21 different transactions - yielding some 13 crore declarations annually - under the new law, the number of non-PAN declarations have been reduced significantly. No filings are required where data is already available through banking systems or digital payments, govt said Monday. Issuing PAN, for which five crore applications are made annually, too is expected to be speeded up with new simplified forms.The draft rules, released for public comments on Saturday, have also raised the transaction limits for quoting of PAN for cash deposits and withdrawal in banks, for purchase of motor vehicles and property, and payment of hotel bills.It has also proposed raising the value of tax-free perquisites provided by employers, and making it mandatory for crypto exchanges to share information with the department. Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) will be included as an accepted mode of electronic payment.Following stakeholder consultation, the rules are expected to be finalised by the first week of March.According to the proposed rules, quoting PAN will be mandatory for making cash deposits or withdrawals of Rs 10 lakh or more in a financial year. Currently, PAN is required for cash deposits of Rs 50,000 during a day with a bank.While purchasing vehicles, a buyer has to quote PAN if the price exceeds Rs 5 lakh. Under current rules, PAN is not required for purchase of two-wheelers.Officials said the idea is to capture only relevant information and ""leveraging tech-enhancements of reporting entities"" under the Income Tax Act.

It has become a daily routine,"" Adrit Mishra, chief operating officer at Tata Starbucks told TOI.""A cup of iced coffee already includes anywhere between 20-25 grams of protein and topping it up with a protein-infused cold foam will give a consumer another 11-15 grams of protein depending on the portion size of the drink.Starbucks is also offering people the choice of cold foam with zero added sugar as Indians become more inclined towards cutting down on sugar levels. The product is targeted at consumers who are mindful of their health but do not want to compromise on their regular lifestyle, Mishra said. India has traditionally been a tea-drinking nation but coffee is now becoming more common in households and coffeehouses are propagating coffee culture. A cup of branded coffee is still aspirational for many and people are willing to get a dose of hot coffee while heading to work or drinking a cold brew after hitting the gym.Starbucks plans to extend the protein foam to hot brews as well in about six months or so besides exploring the idea of adding the feature to more categories going ahead, said Mishra.

"Govt must monitor unfairly priced steel imports, says Tata Steel CEO TV Narendran",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/govt-must-monitor-unfairly-priced-steel-imports-says-tata-steel-ceo-tv-narendran/articleshow/128128117.cms,"Tata Steel MD and CEO TV Narendran, Tata Steel CFO Koushik Chatterjee

PAT has jumped sharply year on year. How do you see the third quarter numbers?

Global and Indian steel prices have been weak. What is your outlook on margins for the next two quarters?

Given India’s dependence on imported coking coal, are you seeing any structural relief on sourcing, or is cost volatility continuing?

On CBAM, how do you view the EU’s CBAM regulation and what impact will it have on your business?

Indian steel volumes have been very strong. Which sectors are driving demand, and do you see any early signs of slowdown?

How confident is Tata Steel in maintaining current utilisation levels at its Indian factories amid imports and rising competition?

How do you see the India-EU FTA impacting Tata Steel, given your international operations, and will it help collaboration on green steel?

How effective have recent safeguards by the Indian govt been in protecting the steel industry, and what more does the industry expect from the government?

What are Tata Steel’s top priorities over the next three years?

There is a probe underway by the CCI against major steel players, including Tata Steel. What is your response, and have there been any discussions with the government?

NEW DELHI: Govt must keep a watch on unfairly priced steel imports, Tata Steel MD and CEO TV Narendran told TOI in an interview, while adding that the price of the key industrial product is expected to rise in the domestic market in the current quarter. He also said that EU’s carbon border tax (CBAM) will have little impact on Tata Steel’s Indian operations and is a positive for its Europe business, as it levels the carbon cost for all suppliers selling into the region.Tata Steel CFO Koushik Chatterjee said the company managed to protect its margins in one of the toughest years for the steel industry in five years and that the India-EU FTA is an opportunity for Indian companies to transition into low-carbon technologies to export into the EU. Excerpts:Chatterjee: The last three quarters’ consolidated numbers had an almost consistent EBITDA margin of about 15% in spite of very weak markets, especially in the second and the third quarter. It is attributable to the cost-takeout program that we announced in the beginning of the year, and we are almost on track, except in the Netherlands, where delays in the negotiations with the unions have pushed timing. What would have come by March will come now around June once the restructuring is completed. Our target has been to be in that zone of 15% EBITDA margin consolidated, which is essentially in the region of 22 to 24% for a standalone basis.With the Kalinganagar plant now commissioned almost fully and the downstream products mix also coming into play, India margins will look to expand. In the Netherlands we should see margin expansion because of consistent operating performance and two big regulatory impacts — CBAM, which will push the price up, and tariff quotas, which will come in from July. Overall, in one of the most challenging years in the last four or five years, we have been able to maintain this, we should be holding on to our cost gains and building on it. When the market provides that tailwind, we should be in a better position.Narendran: Steel prices seem to have hit its bottom in the last quarter. We are expecting steel prices to go up in India; realizations will be about Rs 2,200 higher per tonne for India for Tata Steel in the fourth quarter compared to the third. While the spot prices have started going up, the realizations quarter on quarter for us will be down about Rs 3,200 because of the mix, because we're selling more volumes and some of the lower-price segments even though spot prices are up. Overall, we expect margins to be better in Q4. Volumes are also better for us in Q4 compared to Q3, by almost half a million tonnes and hopefully the momentum will carry on. We are watchful on coking-coal prices which have also gone up by about $50 in the last few weeks. The worst is behind us.Narendran: Coking coal is not a very liquid market; it's highly volatile depending on one-off events. If bad weather in Australia impacts ports, then coking coal prices shoot up. That's a problem compared with iron ore, which is a much more liquid market for Tata Steel India. Most of the coal we import will be from Australia because that's the best coal for us. The US trade deal opens up options from the US but those are not suitable for most of Tata Steel's coal carbons because we use a technology called stamp charging for which Australian or Indian coal is better. The US coal is not so great... We buy some volumes for India where we use top-charged coal, coke-making technology at small volumes, but we buy coal from the US for the Netherlands. This will be a volatile market.Narendran: CBAM is actually a carbon-equalization tax; it is less of a trade issue and more of a carbon-equalization tax. We operate in Europe, where we pay a carbon tax in Europe and CBAM ensures that anyone who sells in Europe pays the same carbon tax. So CBAM is positive for our European operation. We don't sell much steel from India to Europe. So we are not impacted by CBAM significantly for the Indian operation.Narendran: Indian steel demand has been strong. We've always said over the last few years that steel demand growth in India will be at a higher growth rate than the GDP growth rate because it's investment-led growth. Earlier it used to be more consumption-led growth. So, if GDP was growing at 7%, steel demand would grow at 5%. Now when GDP is growing at 7%, we are seeing steel demand grow at 9-10%. We are seeing strong growth across sectors. Automotive is very strong. Construction is also continuing to pick up because of infrastructure spending. Some concerns have been payments from state governments; particularly the MSME sector gets impacted when projects' payments come late, so liquidity has been a bit of a concern in the market. Otherwise, from a pure demand point of view, the Indian demand story has been great.Narendran: We've always had among the highest capacity utilizations in the country. We are pretty much at 100% all the time, every year apart from the COVID year. Otherwise, we run full out unless there is a planned shutdown like blast-furnace refractory linings. Largely we are confident because we have a very strong franchise in the domestic market. Our exports are typically 5–10% of production because we are able to sell all that we produce in the domestic market. I don't see that as a problem. We work well in advance of production to develop inroads in the market.Chatterjee: One important thing in the FTA has been that CBAM has been kept as a carbon-equalisation measure because local players in the EU pay that carbon cost. CBAM itself is meant to trigger transition to green steel. We are seeing that in the Netherlands where we are involved and others of our peers are doing that and it may help Indian companies move towards a green-steel configuration especially those who want to export into the EU. To export into the EU you have to reduce your carbon footprint and modify technologies which will ensure CO2 levels go down. The carbon tax or the EU ETS tax will be a hindrance in exporting competitively into the EU. If the EU increases spending on defence, infrastructure and engineering, it can become an attractive market needing low-carbon steel. It is an opportunity for Indian companies to think about transiting into low-carbon technologies and making green steel if they have interest in exporting into the EU.Narendran: The safeguard has been helpful. When it was announced, it was for six months, which created uncertainty; the notification ended in Nov and there was a period when it was not sure if it would get extended. That confirmation is helpful to give us long-term certainty. It's been extended for another two years which is good. While we had originally asked for more safeguard, even this level is fine for the time being. Our ask of the government is always to keep a watch on unfairly priced imports. The steel sector is the biggest private-sector capital investor in the country and we shouldn't be derailed by unfairly priced imports from countries and companies who are not making money at those prices. The second part is whenever there are trade complaints action should be taken fast because the damage is caused fast. The third part, which is already getting addressed in the budget, is to continue to spend on infrastructure because that not only helps demand for steel but also lowers the cost of doing business outside factory gates — logistics and transportation costs are important components of our costs. These are the areas where we can get help from the government, which we're getting.Narendran: First, continued growth in India, not only in volume but also in terms of the right product mix. We will keep investing in downstream businesses. Second, transformation in Europe both in terms of financial performance in the UK as well as moving to greener process routes in the UK and the Netherlands. Third, in the Netherlands, where we are dealing with some challenges to our social licence to operate, we need to address those.Narendran: We will follow due process. These are allegations being made and we have accessed the report and are reviewing it. From what we've seen, the commentary is more on steel prices moving up and down; steel prices reflect global prices and commodity movements like coking coal costs. It's very open and transparent so we will make our submissions to the CCI. We will have the opportunity over the next few months and we feel we've done nothing wrong. Steel prices move up and down. We've also had the lowest steel prices in the last few three years so I don't think anyone anywhere can control steel prices simply because it's a global product and its price is determined by international factors. We'll make a submission to the CCI and hopefully they will hear and appreciate our point of view.",Tata Steel CFO Koushik Chatterjee said the company managed to protect its margins in one of the toughest years for the steel industry in five years.

Carry-Forward Expectations

India’s real estate sector continued its growth momentum in 2025, reaffirming its position as a core pillar of the country's economic expansion. Currently contributing nearly 8% to GDP, the sector is projected to contribute 15-16% by 2047, aligning with India’s vision of “Viksit Bharat”. The Budget reinforces this trajectory through infrastructure-led development, policy & tax reforms, though some sector-specific expectations remain unaddressed.Proposal to monetize public sector real estate assets through dedicated REITs is expected to unlock value from idle assets, deepen institutional participation & enable efficient capital recycling across the sector.The government has reiterated its commitment to Tier 2 & Tier 3 cities, including temple towns, by allocating INR 5,000 crore over 5 years per City Economic Region. This is likely to stimulate urbanisation beyond metros & drive housing demand.Another notable thrust is on industrial & logistics corridors, supported by development of university townships integrating research institutions, skill centres & residential infrastructure.This integrated approach is expected to boost employment generation while creating demand for commercial & residential real estate.Further, development of dedicated rail freight corridors, textile & chemical parks will have positive spillover effects on industrial real estate, warehousing & allied infrastructure.For self-occupied properties, prior-period interest on housing loans continues to be deductible in 5 equal installments after construction completion. This prior-period interest has now been aligned with the Old Regime, with the overall interest deduction capped at INR 2 lakh per annum.Resident individuals & HUFs purchasing property from non-resident sellers can now deduct TDS by quoting PAN without the requirement to obtain a TAN.Consideration received on buy-back of shares will now be taxed as capital gains instead of dividends, with entitlement to capital loss on the cost of shares. However, promoters will be subject to an additional levy, resulting in higher effective tax rate for them.The Budget aligns income-tax provisions for compulsory acquisition of land under Right to Fair Compensation & Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation & Resettlement Act, 2013, bringing clarity & consistency.MAT has been proposed to be reduced from 15% to 14%.For domestic companies continuing under the old tax regime post March 31, 2026, MAT paid will be treated as final tax liability, with no new MAT credit generation. Existing MAT credit as on March 31, 2026 will not be available for set-off unless the company transitions to the new regime.Companies migrating to the new regime during or after FY 2026–27 will be allowed to utilise MAT credit, subject to set-off capped at 25% of normal tax liability per year & carry forward permitted for 15 years from the date of generation.The MAT amendments are designed to encourage migration to the new tax regime. However, as REIT unitholder dividend exemptions remain linked to SPVs under the old regime, REIT managers will need to carefully evaluate the cost-benefit implications.The Budget also promotes foreign investment in Indian data centres by introducing a tax holiday for foreign companies until March 31, 2047 on income from procuring data centre services from specified Indian facilities. Services to Indian users must be routed through an Indian reseller entity.Additionally, the government has proposed the convergence of the Income Computation and Disclosure Standards (ICDS) with Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) through a joint Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA)–Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) committee, along with a comprehensive review of the Foreign Exchange Management Act (Non-Debt Instruments) Rules to align them with India’s evolving economic priorities.Even as the reforms strengthen the sector’s overall framework, certain areas could be candidates for future refinement, including affordable housing incentives, interest deduction limits under the new regime, sector-specific relief for hospitality and tourism, and flexibility in ITC utilisation for leased assets.Overall, the Budget presents a largely positive outlook for the real estate sector, driven by infrastructure expansion, regional development & tax rationalisation. The government’s proactive engagement with industry stakeholders throughout the year rather than relying solely on annual budget announcements offers optimism that pending sectoral expectations may be addressed as India progresses toward its Viksit Bharat 2047 vision.","India’s real estate sector continued its growth momentum in 2025, reaffirming its position as a core pillar of the country's economic expansion.

Benchmarking its market access strategy to product sensitivity, India will grant quota-based duty concessions in the automobile sector while offering market access to alcoholic beverages under tariff reduction and minimum import price-based formulations under the trade pact with the United States, the government said on Monday, PTI reported.Under the agreement, tariffs on $30.94 billion of India’s exports will be reduced from 50 per cent to 18 per cent, while reciprocal tariffs on another $10.03 billion will be eliminated.""This means a substantial share of Indian goods entering the US market will now face either sharply lower tariffs or completely duty-free access, significantly improving price competitiveness,"" the government said.The government said $1.36 billion of Indian agricultural exports will receive zero additional US duty access. Key products include spices, tea, coffee, fruits, nuts and processed foods.Sensitive sectors such as automobiles have been liberalised through a mix of quota and duty reduction mechanisms. According to an official, India is not granting any duty concessions on electric vehicles to the US.Medical devices have been placed under long and staggered phasing schedules, while precious metals and other sensitive industrial products are being managed through quota-based tariff lowering.""Alcoholic beverages have been offered under tariff reduction along with minimum import price-based formulations, consistent with India's approach in other FTAs (free trade agreements),"" it added.Listing sectoral gains, the government said tariffs on textile exports will be cut from 50 per cent to 18 per cent, while silk will get nil duty access, opening opportunities in the US textile market valued at $113 billion.Tariffs for the domestic gems and jewellery sector will also fall to 18 per cent, providing preferential access to the US market valued at $61 billion.""In addition, 0 per cent duty market access has been secured for major product categories including diamonds, platinum and coins, covering a US market of $29 billion,"" it added.Key export segments expected to gain include cut and polished diamonds, lab-grown synthetic diamonds, coloured gemstones, synthetic stones and articles made of gold, silver and platinum.India maintains a $1.3 billion trade surplus in agricultural trade with the US, with exports of $3.4 billion and imports of $2.1 billion in 2024, the government said.The United States will apply zero additional duty on Indian exports worth $1.36 billion. Beneficiary items include spices, tea, coffee, copra, coconut oil, cashew nuts, chestnuts, avocados, bananas, guavas, mangoes, kiwis, papayas, pineapples and mushrooms.Cereals such as barley and canary seeds, bakery products, cocoa and cocoa preparations, sesame and poppy seeds, and processed food products such as fruit pulp, juices and jams will also benefit.In line with India’s existing FTA approach, agricultural market access has been structured based on product sensitivity, including immediate duty elimination, phased elimination of up to 10 years, tariff reduction, margin of preference and tariff rate quota mechanisms.Highly sensitive agricultural sectors remain fully protected under an exemption category. These include meat, poultry, dairy products, GM food products, soyameal, maize and cereals.For select sensitive products, tariff reduction has been applied to maintain measured duty protection. Examples include plant parts, olives, pyrethrum and oil cakes.Certain highly sensitive items have been liberalised under tariff rate quotas (TRQs), allowing limited quantities at reduced duties. These include in-shell almonds, walnuts, pistachios and lentils.Phased tariff elimination of up to 10 years has been offered for certain intermediate food processing inputs sourced from multiple countries, including albumins, coconut oil, castor oil, cotton seed oil and plant derivatives.""Immediate duty elimination has been offered only for select non-sensitive products that are already liberalised under other FTAs,"" it said.For industrial goods, the agreement secures zero additional duty access for exports valued at $38 billion, the government said.India will get zero reciprocal duty access in key industrial categories including gems and diamonds, platinum and coins, clocks and watches, essential oils, inorganic chemicals, paper articles, plastics, wood products and natural rubber.Market access for American industrial goods has been structured strictly based on product sensitivity, combining immediate tariff elimination, phased reduction of up to 10 years and quota-based access.In digital trade, India’s digitally delivered services exports stood at $0.28 trillion in 2024, growing 10.3 per cent year-on-year.India ranks fifth globally in digitally delivered services exports and eleventh in imports, while the US ranks first in both categories.""A structured digital trade framework between the two countries reduces regulatory uncertainty, lowers compliance friction and facilitates smoother cross-border service delivery,"" the government said.","Under the agreement, tariffs on $30.94 billion of India’s exports will be reduced from 50 per cent to 18 per cent.

US President Donald Trump sees the US stock market doubling from here by the end of his term. Praising the first year of his second term, Trump expressed confidence that the stock market could double within the next two years after the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed above the 50,000 mark for the first time on Friday.Posting on Truth Social during the Super Bowl on Sunday night, Trump attributed the Dow Jones’ milestone to what he believes are strong tariffs and national security policies. He said he expected the Dow to reach 100,000 by the time his term concludes, adding that he hoped the United States Supreme Court was observing developments. This comment is widely being interpreted as a message urging the court not to interfere with his tariff agenda.""Record Stock Market, and National Security, driven by our Great TARIFFS. I am predicting 100,000 on the DOW by the end of my Term.REMEMBER, TRUMP WAS RIGHT ABOUT EVERYTHING! I hope the United States Supreme Court is watching,” he posted on Truth Social.Trump has repeatedly argued that his tariff policies have helped rebalance global trade, contributed to international stability, and boosted economic prosperity in the United States through increased revenue from abroad.Trump has repeatedly argued that his tariff policies have helped rebalance global trade, contributed to international stability, and boosted economic prosperity in the United States through increased revenue from abroad. He also pointed to an estimated 5.4% expansion in gross domestic product in the previous quarter, despite what he described as a record-long government shutdown driven by Democrats.According to his remarks, the shutdown was carried out under the banner of healthcare reform that ultimately did not materialise, with conservatives claiming it was intended as a political move against him. He further stated that Senate Democrats triggered another shutdown toward the end of last month and could potentially cause another if funding for the Department of Homeland Security is not approved before the February 13 deadline later this week.The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed above the 50,000 level for the first time on Friday. This marked a historic milestone for the blue-chip index as investors increasingly shifted toward non-technology stocks this year.The index climbed 1,206.95 points, or 2.47%, to settle at 50,115.67 at the close of trading. The strong gain reflects continued momentum in the Dow, which has outperformed other major Wall Street benchmarks so far this year.Market participants have increasingly turned to stocks outside the technology sector, supporting the index’s advance and helping drive its year-to-date rise.

Even during the Wednesday layoffs, his absence and subsequent appearance at a Super Bowl event in San Francisco reportedly caused anger.The Washington Post announced what it called a “significant restructuring” of its operations, including the closure of its standalone Sports desk and a reduction in its international reporting presence. According to Fox News, roughly a third of the organisation’s workforce which is nearly 300 employees were affected.Bezos broke his silence since the layoffs, stating in a statement that ""The Post has an essential journalistic mission and an extraordinary opportunity.""

How Trump's claims on tariffs are far from reality,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/how-trumps-claim-on-tariffs-are-far-from-reality/articleshow/128000245.cms,"Beyond Tariffs: The India–US Deal and the Politics of Oil

Here is what Trump claimed and how far were they from facts

""Just over one year ago, we were a ‘DEAD’ country. Now, we are the ‘HOTTEST” country anywhere in the world!""

US was not dead when he returned to the Oval office for his second stint for POTUS. Despite a shaky start of his second term, the economy has performed strongly overall.

In 2024, the last year of the Biden presidency, American gross domestic product grew 2.8%, adjusted for inflation, faster than any wealthy country in the world except Spain. It also expanded at a healthy rate from 2021 through 2023.

presidency, American gross domestic product grew 2.8%, adjusted for inflation, faster than any wealthy country in the world except Spain. It also expanded at a healthy rate from 2021 through 2023. Meanwhile, first three quarters show that Trump’s tariffs - or even the threat of them - produced mixed outcomes. However, Full-year data for 2025 is not yet available.

From January to March, US GDP contracted for the first time in three years. The reason was clear: imports surged as American companies rushed to stock up on foreign goods ahead of potential tariff hikes. Since imports are subtracted from GDP, the spike dragged growth into negative territory.

The slowdown proved temporary. Growth rebounded sharply in the second quarter, with the economy expanding at an annualised rate of 3.8% from April to June. Momentum strengthened further in the third quarter, when growth accelerated to 4.4%. The rebound was driven in part by a decline in imports, reflecting both the impact of tariffs and earlier stockpiling. Strong consumer spending also played a major role.

Trump has also pointed to gains in the US stock market, noting that stocks hit record highs 52 times in 2025. While the market did post solid gains, its performance lagged several global peers.

“Annual core inflation for the past three months has dropped to just 1.4% - far lower than almost anyone, other than me, had predicted.”

According to news agency AP, Trump is using cherry-picked data to vastly exaggerate where inflation stands. Trump’s preferred inflation figure - annual inflation over the past three months excluding food and energy - is low. But it is also distorted. A government shutdown in October and November disrupted data collection, forcing the statistical agency to rely on rough estimates in some categories, which artificially pushed overall inflation lower.

Core inflation over the final six months of 2025 stood at 2.6%. That is lower than January 2025 levels but roughly in line with October 2024. Overall inflation has largely plateaued this year. It was running at 3% in September, before the shutdown - the same level as in January 2025.

It is true that inflation did not spike as sharply as many economists feared when Trump began rolling out tariffs last spring. But that is partly because many of the so-called “Liberation Day” tariffs were later withdrawn, scaled back or riddled with exemptions.

The impact of tariffs is clearer in core goods prices, which also exclude food and energy. Before the pandemic, core goods prices typically rose little or even fell year after year. By last December, however, they were 1.4% higher than a year earlier - the biggest increase outside the pandemic since 2011.

“The data shows that the burden, or ‘incidence,’ of the tariffs has fallen overwhelmingly on foreign producers and middlemen… paying at least 80% of tariff costs.”

The study Trump cited appears to show the opposite. Co-authored by Cavallo, it finds that US consumers bore about 43% of the tariff-related costs after seven months, with most of the remainder absorbed by US firms.

Cavallo said import prices barely declined, suggesting foreign exporters did not cut prices enough to shoulder most of the burden.

“We have slashed our monthly trade deficit by an astonishing 77%.”

This figure also relies on cherry-picking - comparing an unusually large deficit in January 2025, when Trump took office, with an unusually small one in October. The broader trend is less flattering.

From January through November 2025, the US ran a trade deficit of nearly $840 billion, about 4% higher than during the same period in 2024.

Imports surged in the first three months of the year as companies rushed to buy foreign goods ahead of tariffs.

While monthly deficits fell later in the year, the early import spike was so large that the year-to-date deficit still exceeds last year’s.

""I have successfully used tariffs to secure colossal investments in America… more than $18 trillion.”

Trump did use tariff threats to extract investment pledges from trading partners. The European Union alone promised $600 billion over four years.

But the administration has not explained how it arrived at the $18 trillion figure.

The White House has cited $9.6 trillion in public and private commitments. Researchers at the Peterson Institute for International Economics estimate the pledges at about $5 trillion from the EU, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Switzerland, Liechtenstein and Gulf states including Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Bahrain and the UAE.

has cited $9.6 trillion in public and private commitments. Researchers at the Peterson Institute for International Economics estimate the pledges at about $5 trillion from the EU, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Switzerland, Liechtenstein and Gulf states including Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Bahrain and the UAE. They also caution that many pledges are vague and may never fully materialise, in part because some countries would struggle to finance them.

The numbers are large by any measure. Total private investment in the US currently runs at about $5.4 trillion annually. In 2024, foreign direct investment - money put into factories, offices and other physical assets - totaled just $151 billion.

US President Donald Trump has, at several occasions, claimed that broad tariffs on different countries has revived the American economy. In his recent opinion piece in The Wall Street Journal, Trump claimed that tariffs have created an ""American economic miracle. ""He also lamented on critics and economists who predicted that tariffs would backfire, raising prices and threatening growth.""When I imposed historic tariffs on nearly all foreign countries last April, the critics said my policies would cause a global economic meltdown,"" US president wrote.""Instead, they have created an American economic miracle, and we are quickly building the greatest economy in the history of the world, with other countries doing just fine!"" he added.However, it appears the US president is playing fast and loose with his claims, which are often not supported by facts.","Despite a shaky start of his second term, the economy has performed strongly overall.

Iran’s IRGC ‘CAPTURE’ Two Foreign Oil Tankers, Send Message To Trump Ahead Of Iran-US Nuke Talks

The United States on Friday announced new sanctions targeting Iran’s oil and petrochemical trade, hours after indirect talks between Tehran and Washington concluded in Oman.The move came even as both sides signalled willingness to continue negotiations aimed at easing tensions over Iran’s nuclear programme.The sanctions, unveiled by the US State Department, target 15 entities and 14 vessels linked to Iran’s “shadow fleet,” which is used to transport petroleum, petroleum products and petrochemicals in violation of international restrictions, according to Reuters.In a statement, State Department spokesperson Tommy Pigott said that the measures were part of the Trump administration’s renewed pressure campaign against Tehran.“President Donald Trump is committed to driving down the Iranian regime's illicit oil and petrochemical exports under the administration's maximum pressure campaign,” Pigott said.The United States said that the fresh sanctions were aimed at cutting off revenue streams that Tehran uses to fund repression at home and destabilising activities abroad.Pigott accused Tehran of prioritising repression and regional destabilisation over domestic welfare.“Instead of investing in the welfare of its own people and crumbling infrastructure, the Iranian regime continues to fund destabilizing activities around the world and step up its repression inside Iran,” he said.Warning of continued pressure, he added: “So long as Iranian regime attempts to evade sanctions and generate oil and petrochemical revenues to fund such oppressive behavior and support terrorist activities and proxies, the United States will act to hold both the Iranian regime and its partners accountable.”Among the entities sanctioned by the United States is an India-based firm involved in managing a vessel accused of transporting Iranian petroleum products in violation of international restrictions.According to the US State Department, Elevate Marine Management Private Limited (ELEVATE), an Indian commercial shipping management company, served as the commercial manager of the BENEDICT, a Cameroon-flagged crude oil tanker. The vessel is alleged to have transported Iranian petroleum products on at least three occasions between September and November 2025.Akash Anant Shinde is an Indian national and director of Elevate Marine Management Private Limited.The announcement came shortly after Iranian and US officials wrapped up a day of indirect negotiations in Muscat, mediated by Oman. The talks were described as constructive by TehranIran’s foreign minister Abbas Araghchi, speaking after the talks, struck a cautiously optimistic tone, calling the discussions “a good start.”“If we can go along with this positive path, I can say that we can reach a positive framework regarding the nuclear talks between Iran and the US,” Araghchi told reporters.He said both sides had agreed to continue discussions after further consultations in their respective capitals.“Our concerns were conveyed, as well as our interests and the rights that the Iranian people have. It was conveyed in a very good atmosphere, and the views of the other side were also heard,” he added.According to Oman’s foreign ministry, foreign minister Badr al-Busaidi met separately with Araghchi and US Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff in Muscat.Footage later released by Oman’s state news agency showed US Navy Admiral Brad Cooper, head of US Central Command also present.The negotiations mark the first formal engagement since the United States joined Israel’s military action against Iran in June, during which US strikes damaged Iranian nuclear facilities.Israel also targeted Iran’s air defence systems and ballistic missile infrastructure. Since then, Washington has bolstered its military presence in the region, deploying additional warships, fighter jets and the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln.US officials have indicated that Washington wants the talks to go beyond Iran’s nuclear programme to include its missile capabilities and regional influence. Iran, however, has insisted that discussions remain limited.US Secretary of State Marco Rubio acknowledged the difficulty of the negotiations earlier this week, saying, “I’m not sure you can reach a deal with these guys, but we’re going to try to find out.”Tensions remain high as both sides weigh diplomacy against the risk of escalation. The US has recently shot down an Iranian drone near the USS Abraham Lincoln, while Iran has attempted to stop a US-flagged vessel in the Strait of Hormuz.Friday’s sanctions also follow similar measures imposed last month, when the US targeted vessels accused of moving hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of Iranian oil.The Treasury Department has said that Iran’s shadow fleet plays a critical role in financing the regime, including its domestic crackdowns and regional activities.","The sanctions target 15 entities and 14 vessels linked to Iran’s ‘shadow fleet,’ which is used to transport petroleum, petroleum products and petrochemicals in violation of international restrictions.

AI spending worries hit Amazon

Bitcoin stabilises, crypto stocks jump

Consumers, airlines and smaller stocks gain

US stock markets moved higher on Friday, clawing back part of the heavy losses seen earlier in the week, as technology shares recovered and bitcoin halted its recent slide.The rebound came after several volatile sessions driven by worries over massive spending on artificial intelligence and its impact on corporate profits.The S&P 500 rose 0.9 per cent, marking only its second gain in the past eight sessions. The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 776 points, or 1.6 per cent, while the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.5 per cent by mid-morning trading in New York.Chipmakers led the recovery. Nvidia climbed 4.9 per cent, trimming a weekly decline of more than 10 per cent, while Broadcom gained 3.8 per cent after falling sharply earlier in the week.According to news agency AP, hopes of strong long-term demand for chips linked to artificial intelligence continued to support the sector.Despite the broader rebound, concerns over soaring AI investment remained. Amazon shares slumped 8.5 per cent after the company said it expects to spend around $200 billion this year on areas such as AI, chips, robotics and low-earth-orbit satellites.Similar spending plans announced earlier by Alphabet have raised questions about whether such large investments will deliver enough future profits.As per news agency AFP, investors have grown cautious after a period when enthusiasm around AI lifted much of the technology sector.Chris Low of FHN Financial said markets were now reassessing whether the sell-off had gone too far, noting that traders felt some of the recent declines may have been “overdone”.Even with Friday’s gains, the S&P 500 was still on course for its third weekly fall in four weeks.Bitcoin showed signs of stabilising after weeks of losses that wiped out more than half its value since its October peak.The cryptocurrency recovered to around $68,000 after briefly slipping near $60,000 late on Thursday.The move helped lift shares linked to the crypto sector. Robinhood Markets surged 11.7 per cent, Coinbase Global rose 7.3 per cent, and Strategy, a company known for holding large amounts of bitcoin, jumped 15.9 per cent.US consumer sentiment also provided some support. A preliminary survey from the University of Michigan showed sentiment improving slightly, defying expectations of a fall. The improvement was strongest among households that own shares.Airline stocks gained on hopes that stronger confidence would translate into more travel spending. United Airlines rose 5.4 per cent, American Airlines gained 4.6 per cent, and Delta Air Lines added 4.4 per cent.Smaller companies outperformed larger peers, with the Russell 2000 index climbing 2.3 per cent. These firms tend to be more sensitive to the strength of the US economy.In the bond market, US Treasury yields were largely steady. The yield on the 10-year Treasury held at around 4.21 per cent, unchanged from late Thursday.","The S&P 500 rose 0.9 per cent, marking only its second gain in the past eight sessions.

German exports to the United States plunged last year due to President Donald Trump's tariff blitz, and the trade surplus of Europe's top economy with the US shrunk to a four-year low, data showed Friday.But total exports for 2025 rebounded by around one percent following two years of contraction, as stronger trade with Europe offset falling shipments to the United States, statistics agency Destatis said.German exports to the United States fell 9.3 percent last year, while US imports to Germany rose slightly.Germany's trade surplus with the world's biggest economy was 52.2 billion euros ($62 billion), its lowest level since 2021, after a record surplus the previous year of nearly 70 billion euros.China returned as Germany's biggest trading partner last year, overtaking the US, as exports from the world's number two economy to Germany rose sharply, according to the preliminary data.Europe was in Trump's crosshairs when he launched his tariff onslaught as it runs a hefty trade surplus with the United States, much of it due to German exports.Under a deal struck in July, EU exports to the United States face a baseline levy of 15 percent -- far higher than before Trump's return to office.It was a heavy blow for Germany, whose firms, from well-known automakers and machinery giants to smaller, family-owned companies, have long relied on robust trade with the United States.","German exports to the United States fell 9.3 percent last year, while US imports to Germany rose slightly.

The downturn rippled across asset classes, battering silver once again and pushing bitcoin to levels that erased all gains made since US President Donald Trump’s election victory in the United States.Adding to investor anxiety was an announcement from AI startup Anthropic, known for creating the Claude chatbot. The company revealed a new tool capable of replacing multiple software functions, including applications used in legal services and data marketing. US markets closed lower for a third consecutive session on Thursday. All three major Wall Street indexes recorded significant losses, with the Nasdaq suffering the steepest decline.The index has now logged its worst three-day performance since the tariff-driven market turmoil in April during Trump’s presidency.Economic data from the US added further pressure. Monthly job openings fell to their lowest level since 2020, while companies announced the highest number of job cuts for January since the global financial crisis in 2009, intensifying worries about the broader US economy.Precious metals remained under heavy selling pressure. Silver plunged by around 18 percent at one stage before recovering to trade near $70 an ounce, its lowest level since December. The metal had been trading above $121 just a week earlier. Gold also fell, shedding about two percent to sit just under $4,800, compared with its peak of $5,595 last Thursday.The recent slump in metals followed a surge in the US dollar last weekend after Trump appointed a relatively hawkish figure to lead the Federal Reserve, alongside easing geopolitical tensions.Cryptocurrencies were also caught in the sell-off. Bitcoin fell to its weakest level since October and narrowly avoided slipping below $60,000, wiping out gains linked to expectations of more crypto-friendly policies under Trump. The digital currency has now dropped more than 50 percent from its record high above $126,000 reached in October.In corporate news, Rio Tinto shares declined after the British-Australian miner said it would abandon merger talkswith Switzerland-based Glencore.

NEW DELHI: More than 1.14 lakh startups in India have created over 12 lakh jobs so far, the finance ministry said in its latest review of the Indian economy.In the report titled, ‘The Indian Economy: A Review January 2024’, the Department of Economic Affairs said that the 1.14 lakh startups recognised by the government under the 'Startup India initiative’ created more than 12 lakh jobs (as of October 2023).The state-owned e-commerce platform Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) clocked more than 63 lakh transactions till November 2023, the document read.Despite facing global challenges in 2023 like valuation issues, few IPOs, regulatory changes and macroeconomic and geopolitical trends, India remains the third largest tech start-up ecosystem globally, with over 950 tech startups founded last year.The cumulative funding for more than 31,000 tech start ups has exceeded $70 billion (from 2019 to 2023), according to a recent report by Nasscom in collaboration with Zinnov.“In 2023, despite facing global economic and regulatory challenges, Indian tech startups have prioritised the imperative of enhancing their business fundamentals, driving profitability and growth,” said Debjani Ghosh, President, Nasscom.“The proliferation of tech startups in tier 2 and 3 cities marks the ecosystem's resilience,” she added.Navigating 2024, tech startup founders expect to continue the revenue growth path with measured steps focusing on optimising expenditure and maximising profitability for B2B tech startups.Investments in deeptech will continue an upward trend in 2024.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran Udaan until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.Udaan built an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business still accounts for a very small part of India’s overall retail market but can balloon to $150 billion in sales and yield a 100% return on capital invested in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co. estimates published in the Mint newspaper.Bengaluru-based Udaan has also ventured into financing through its fintech unit which helps shopkeepers get working capital loans to buy inventory. That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says.

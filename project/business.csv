Vodafone Idea shares surge 18% after Union Cabinet approves bank guarantee waiver,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/vodafone-idea-shares-surge-18-after-union-cabinet-approves-bank-guarantee-waiver/articleshow/115691990.cms,"The Cabinet offered relief to telecommunications firms by eliminating bank guarantee requirements for spectrum acquisitions through 2022.

Vodafone Idea share price today: Vodafone Idea (Vi) shares surged 18.08% to Rs 8.23 on the BSE during early Tuesday trading, following the Union Cabinet's in-principle approval regarding the company's bank guarantee matter. At 2:53 PM, shares of Vi were trading at Rs 7.59, up 8.74%.The Cabinet offered relief to telecommunications firms by eliminating bank guarantee requirements for spectrum acquisitions through 2022. The Department of Telecommunications (DoT) had supported this waiver for spectrum purchases.The reforms of 2021 had already removed bank guarantee requirements for auctions from 2022 onwards. Vi's total bank guarantee obligation stands at Rs 24,700 crore, with the spectrum auction dues moratorium concluding in October 2025.Vodafone Idea defaulted on its second bank guarantee (BG) payment of approximately Rs 350 crore on November 1, relating to spectrum acquired in the 2012 auction. Previously, the company had missed a BG payment exceeding Rs 4,600 crore for 2016 spectrum auction in September, as reported by ET.Although Vi spearheaded the BG waiver request, with support from other telecommunications firms, the government's decision particularly advantages Vi. Whilst competitors Bharti Airtel and Reliance Jio also require BG submissions for previous auction payments, their obligations are considerably smaller than Vi's.Bharti Airtel faces a BG payment of roughly Rs 2,200 crore due in September next year for the 2016 auction. Jio's obligation of approximately Rs 4,400 crore follows afterwards.Vi requested the waiver citing financial constraints, anticipating that this would enable banks to extend additional credit facilities to the company.Following this development, Bharti Airtel shares increased by 1.6% to Rs 1,604.95, whilst Jio Financial Services shares declined nearly 1% to Rs 320.10 on the BSE.","Vodafone Idea (Vi) shares surged 18.08% to Rs 8.23 on the BSE during early Tuesday trading.

GST mop-up in November up 8.5% to ₹1.8 lakh crore,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gst-mop-up-in-november-up-8-5-to-1-8-lakh-crore/articleshow/115877064.cms,"NEW DELHI: Goods and services tax (GST) collection rose 8.5% to Rs 1,82,269 crore in Nov, the fourth highest since the new regime kicked in over seven years ago.The growth in Nov, based on transactions in Oct, was driven by domestic consumption , rising 9.4% to just under Rs 1.4 lakh crore, while imports saw a 5.9% increase, according to latest monthly numbers. While integrated GST on imports grew around 6.5%, cess on imported sin and luxury goods declined over 17%. The numbers indicated that overall imports may have increased, although at a moderate pace.So far this year, gross collections have increased 9.3% to Rs 14.6 lakh crore.The numbers come amid signs of a slowdown in consumption demand in some sectors and GDP expansion moderating to 5.4% during the Sept quarter, the slowest in seven quarters.""The projected GDP growth of 7% in FY25 augurs well for GST collections in the remaining four months of the current fiscal year, considering the fact that the collections in the first eight months of FY25 have exceeded that of FY25 by more than Rs 1 lakh crore and are ahead of the budget estimates for FY25. The slower single-digit growth in some large states like Haryana (2%), Punjab (3%), UP & MP (5%), Tamil Nadu(8%), Telangana (3%) as well the negative growth in Rajasthan (-1%) , Andhra Pradesh ( -10%) , Chhattisgarh (-1%) would be an area of concern as these states have significant manufacturing presence and considerable economic impact,"" said MS Mani, partner at Deloitte , a consulting firm.Others also pointed to the need to boost collections.

While YTD (year-to-date) direct tax collections till Nov 10, 2024 have grown by more than 15%, the YTD GST collections in around that period have grown by only 9.3%. This shows that while income levels are growing in India, yet consumption is not aligned accordingly. It may also mean inequality of income in the country. Further, the YTD GST collections growth is also below the budgeted growth and considering that nominal GDP growth is around 10.5%, the buoyancy of GST collections is below one. This may require some food for thought for the GST Council,"" said Vivek Jalan, partner at Tax Connect Advisory Services.","GST collection rose 8.5% to Rs 1,82,269 crore in Nov.

Sonal Varma, chief economist for India and Asia ex Japan at Nomura, said in an interview:

A hiccup in India’s world-beating economic growth may exacerbate near-term weakness in stocks, according to strategists.The economy expanded at the slowest pace in almost two years in the September quarter, data Friday showed. Market participants expect a pickup in growth in the second half of the fiscal year, especially if the Reserve Bank of India cuts interest rates or slashes the share of deposits lenders must set aside.Concerns about the economy and valuations have India’s NSE Nifty 50 Index about 8% down from a September record. Foreign investors pulled out $2.6 billion from equities last month after a record monthly withdrawal in October. Meanwhile, India’s index-eligible bonds have seen their first monthly outflow since getting added to a key JPMorgan Chase & Co. index.India's Stock Gauge Fell Into Correction Last MonthHere’s a selection of comments on what India’s slowing growth means for its assets.“This should trigger some near-term weakness in the markets, but some of this was already known and partially priced in.”“We do not see the case for a major market selloff but reiterate that near-term upside is also limited due to earnings weakness and valuations.”The year-end Nifty target remains 25,000, and “an incremental correction over 5% in the Nifty is an entry opportunity.”“A silver lining is that the weak growth opens the door for an RBI rate cut” this month.India “might be the longest-tail growth story in the world today among major markets.”“I know we had a hiccup,” but “there will be GDP multiplier here. Economy will continue to grow.”A weak GDP print was already getting reflected in corporate earnings and “we believe that the worst of earnings cuts is likely behind.”Still, a much tighter fiscal 2025 is on the cards, driving yields lower. The possibility of a cut in cash reserve ratio, or a reduction in the share of deposits lenders must set aside, increases.From an FX perspective, the key question is whether this growth blip proves to be short-lived or something more pernicious. The growth slowdown is likely to have been driven also by restrictive monetary policy and the RBI’s moves to tighten macroprudential measures and these factors could continue to weigh on portfolio flowsFrom a rates perspective, this week’s rate meeting is likely to be a close one, with possible increasing dissent out of some members. There may also be moves to cut the cash reserve ratio requirements to help boost banking system liquidity“RBI Governor Das has repeatedly argued the primacy of price stability to support sustained high growth in the medium term.”“Despite some pullback in food prices in early November, we now expect the RBI MPC to stay on hold in the December policy meeting next week and keep the repo rate at 6.5% and the policy stance neutral.”Consumer inflation breaching the upper limit of RBI’s tolerance band in October isn’t not a favorable backdrop to start an easing cycle, even though this recent growth reading disappointed expectations “by a wide margin.”The GDP reading “is a game-changer” for the RBI’s meeting on Friday. “On the face of it, policy tradeoffs may appear stark, but looking at the nuances, we don’t see any tradeoffs and believe easing is long overdue.”“We now expect a 25 basis point repo rate cut” and are “penciling in a 50 basis point cut in the Cash Reserve Ratio to counter tight banking sector liquidity. We stick to our out-of-consensus view of a deeper easing cycle of 100 basis points cumulatively by mid-2025.”","The economy expanded at the slowest pace in almost two years in the September quarter, data showed.

Rate cut looks uncertain despite slowing growth,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/rate-cut-looks-uncertain-despite-slowing-growth/articleshow/115877117.cms,"MUMBAI: Despite growth numbers coming in sharply lower and all-round calls for reduction in interest rates to support growth, the monetary policy committee (MPC) will find reducing rates a challenge.Lower-than-expected Q2 GDP growth numbers at 5.4 per cent have increased pressure on RBI 's MPC to reduce interest rates even as the expectation of a softer policy led to bond yields falling on Friday.The rate-setting panel has also faced pressure from govt, with commerce minister Piyush Goyal suggesting that food prices should be excluded from consideration and finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman advocating for softer rates to boost investment and growth.But while monetary policy cannot impact the prices of tomatoes, onion or potatoes, it can reduce demand and bring down overall prices which will soften headline inflation .According to Shreya Sodhani, economist with Barclays, RBI is expected to keep policy rates unchanged this week despite weaker growth, 'according primacy to price stability'. ""We highlighted that a weaker-than-expected Q3 GDP print may prompt the MPC to ease monetary policy, but the timing would depend on the outlook of growth and inflation,"" Sodhani said in a report.In the MPC meeting in Oct, of the three newly inducted external members, Nagesh Kumar was the only one who called for an immediate 25 basis point rate cut . Earlier in Aug, outgoing members Jayanth Varma and Ashima Goyal had voted for a rate cut. Varma was strident in advocating for lower rates and had said that the status quo in rates undermines India's growth potential.""The outlook for H2 FY25 is decidedly mixed. We foresee a likely improvement in rural demand owing to the robust growth in kharif foodgrain output and upbeat outlook for rabi crops amid replenished reservoir levels, as well as expectations of a back-ended pick up in govt capex,"" Aditi Nayar, chief economist with Icra, said.

This contrasts with September's nine-month high investment of Rs 57,724 crore.Future foreign investments in Indian equity markets will depend on various factors, according to Himanshu Srivastava, associate director manager research, Morningstar Investment Research India told news agency PTI.These include Donald Trump 's presidential policies, current inflation and interest rates, and the global geopolitical situation.Financial experts attribute the recent outflow to increased US bond yields, dollar appreciation and anticipated domestic economic deceleration.Despite November's overall net outflow, FPIs demonstrated a significant shift in the week ending November 29, following the BJP-led Mahayuti alliance's decisive victory in the Maharashtra Assembly elections.The inclusion of select Indian stocks in MSCI's key indices and potential ceasefire prospects between Israel and Lebanon also contributed positively to market sentiment.V K Vijayakumar, chief investment strategist at Geojit Financial Services , highlighted the erratic nature of recent FPI activity, noting that whilst FPIs were buyers during November 23-25, they subsequently sold equity worth Rs 16,139 crore over the next two days.Conversely, FPIs invested Rs 1,217 crore in debt general limit and Rs 3,034 crore in debt Voluntary Retention Route (VRR) during this period.

What’s the tax treatment?

How do they help investors?

Hybrid funds are mutual funds that invest in multiple asset classes, such as a combination of equity and debt, or equity and gold.There are different categories of hybrid funds available for investors to choose based on their risk-taking ability.: These schemes allocate 65% to 80% of their portfolio in equity with the rest in a mix of debt and money market instruments. The fixed income allocation is in the range of 20% to 35%.These schemes use proprietary valuation models to decide their equity allocation. They invest in a mix of equity and debt depending on valuations and market conditions based on a pre-decided internal investment model. They could have up to 35% in debt, some allocation to arbitrage and the rest in equity.These funds have a minimum of 10% in at least three asset classes — typically equity, debt and gold — and alter the allocation based on market conditions. Some schemes also invest in international equities and REITs or InvITs.Invests in equity, debt and arbitrage opportunities in the cash and derivative segments of the equity market, with the equity and arbitrage portion constituting 65% of the portfolio. The unhedged equity portion of the portfolio is onservatively managed and could be between 10% and 25%.Most hybrid fund categories mentioned above are treated as equity funds for taxation. This means if the units are held for less than a year, the investor pays a short-term capital gains tax of 20%, while if held for more than a year, investors pay a long term capital gains tax of 12.5% only.Hybrid funds help investors put money in different asset classes through a single scheme and help in automatic asset allocation. Another benefit for high-net-worth individuals is that even though money is allocated to fixed income, the scheme is treated as an equity fund for taxation.","Hybrid funds are mutual funds that invest in multiple asset classes, such as a combination of equity and debt, or equity and gold.

No stopping him once the die was cast,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/no-stopping-him-once-the-die-was-cast/articleshow/115873044.cms,"Ramesh M from Madurai went to Coimbatore in the mid-1980s to pursue engineering. He stayed on and, yes, started a small industrial unit with a friend. It ran into losses and they closed and parted ways. (Both started new ventures independently and have done well. And, they remain good friends.)“I got into manufacturing because I thought no one will give me a job. But then realised how difficult it is without adequate finance, especially for someone from a middle-class background,” says Ramesh, managing director, Alphacraft Private Limited.“Initially, I did research & development for the defence sector for the light combat aircraft. But later stopped as my work was shared with others. At a young age, you do certain things with a sense of patriotism. But then you realise that the same patriotism is not shared by others,” he says.Ramesh then set his sights on plastic moulding. Someone asked why waste energy on something that many others are doing. He asked Ramesh to focus on making tools, since the industry imports 95%, mostly from Taiwan. His tools did well in the local market and soon he found overseas customers. One such customer would soon turn his business focus upside down.“We were supplying tools to Siemens, Germany. One of their buyers near Tel Aviv in Israel broke a dye and blamed it on the quality of our tool, my company and country. I created a fresh tool in 17 days, flew down and offered it to them free of cost. Ours was a small company, I was drawing 10,000 as salary then, but I gave away this tool that cost 2.5 lakh free of cost just to prove our quality,” says Ramesh.But Siemens was not happy about giving away that tool free of cost, especially when the fault was not that of Alphacraft. “In the end, they cut off ties with the Israeli company and gave all those orders for tools and castings to me. They asked me to establish a foundry and until then outsource castings,” says Ramesh. “I got it done through other companies in Coimbatore and Bengaluru. Six months later I established our own foundry. That was the beginning and till now, we don’t have a marketing division and all overseas orders come on their own because we are the only player offering end-to-end solutions from tools, die casting and machining and castings in aluminium,” he adds.What started as a 1,500 sqft factory in 1996 is today spread over 60,000 sqft with a tool room, foundry and casting machining facilities. Another 50,000 sqft modern and fully automated facility is getting ready by year-end for exports. The company makes custom-developed parts that are fully machined aluminium castings through three processes. These are exported to the US, Germany, the UK, Netherlands, Hungary, Czech Republic, Sweden, Mexico, Spain, Belgium and more. End users include John Deere, Volvo, Parker, Batco, Siemens, Aston Martin and Porche.“All our supplies are for automobile companies abroad. We don’t supply to any four-wheeler company here in India and in two-wheelers only to Ola Electric and in tractors to John Deere,” says Ramesh.While Ramesh and his wife managed the business, they did not take up all orders that came to them. Only after their daughter finished engineering did they have the confidence to expand. They opted for automation for the new plant due to labour shortage.“We employ 400 people including 250 migrant labourers. We have provided industrial housing for 150 migrants. We have accommodated the rest in various houses for which we pay the rent. Business is thriving and we will easily be a 1,000 crore company by 2030, from the present120 crore. Labour and funding are the need of the hour,” says Ramesh.",Ramesh M from Madurai went to Coimbatore in the mid-1980s to pursue engineering.

Times of India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/ports-ahoy/articleshow/115873002.cms,"Seventeen ports along its 1,076km coastline. Tamil Nadu is taking the sea route to becoming a global manufacturing hub. The move to expand the 17 minor ports gains significance with the Chennai-Vladivostok maritime corridor going operational recently.State-owned Tamil Nadu Maritime Board is developing a greenfield port at Cuddalore with a 4,000 crore investment under the PPP model. It will have 25 berths along a 3.6km seafront to handle 40 million tonnes of cargo a year. It is the second port the state’s maritime board is developing more than 10 years after seting up one at Kattupalli, 30 km north of Chennai.Minor ports at Nagapattinam, Udangudi and Rameswaram are also being considered for development to boost growth in these regions, says M Vallalar, vice-chairman and CEO, Tamil Nadu Maritime Board. “Moreover, the move will increase the volume of imports and exports to TN, presently handled by the three major ports, besides Kattupalli.”Coastal shipping can cut transport costs big time. “Annually, we require 120 lakh bales of cotton (each bale weighing 170 kg) and this is sourced from Gujarat, Maharashtra. We can save 1,500-2,000 per tonne if bales are brought by sea instead of by road,” says Vallalar. “We are also exploring possibility of developing a deep seaport in south TN for which minor ports in Tuticorin and Kanyakumari districts are being looked at,” he adds.While Chennai, Kamarajar and Kattupalli ports together handled more than 100 million tonnes in FY2024, V O Chidambaranar Port at Tuticorin recorded a traffic of 41 million tonnes. Kattupalli alone functions under the Tamil Nadu govt. The major ports are under the Union govt.“TN should look at developing minor ports along with Sipcot industrial complexes and/or SEZs,” says J Celestine Villavarayar, CEO of Vilsons Shipping and Tuticorin district chairman of CII. “This will create economic corridors and attract industries. We can emulate the Gujarat Maritime Board, which has completely leveraged its coastline by developing minor ports,” he adds. The delta districts can be considered for a minor port, a greenfield container port can be set up south of Chennai in Chengalpet district, and a minor port with cruise terminal at Kaniyakumari would make strategic and economic sense, says Villavarayar.“More ports will give exporters more options and reduce delays,” says Israr Ahmed, vice-president, Federation of Indian Export Organisations (FIEO). “Coastal shipping is cheaper than road transport. Overall pricing for exports will also come down automatically. Domestic trade and exports will benefit.”The entire port sector should be transferred to the states, says K Ashok Vardhan Shetty, retired IAS officer and former vice-chancellor of Indian Maritime University. Pointing out that coastal shipping in India contributes to less than 5% of freight transport despite the long coastline, he says the corresponding figures are between 10% and 30% for US, China and Europe. Coastal shipping is cheaper, environmentally friendly and will reduce congestion in rail and road traffic, adds Shetty.Developing new ports will benefit TN as the Chennai-Vladivostok maritime corridor has become operational. Chennai Port Authority chairman Sunil Paliwal says it will be a boost for India’s economy by upping exports. “We are becoming the manufacturing hub of the world. In the China plus one policy, everybody is looking at India. Raw material are critical for manufacturing raw material and we are going to get them at a cheaper rate.” Currently, coking coal is imported from Indonesia, Australia, South Africa and US. “When you get coking coal from Far East Russia, you are saving almost 1,000 per tonne,” adds Paliwal. For TN to cash in on the opportunity, developing its ports is critical.","State-owned Tamil Nadu Maritime Board is developing a greenfield port at Cuddalore with a 4,000 crore investment under the PPP model.

IIT-M team working to help India lead in spatial computing,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/iit-m-team-working-to-help-india-lead-in-spatial-computing/articleshow/115873052.cms,"As adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) technology is going on apace, a group of academics and entrepreneurs at IIT-M is working on the next potential big thing -- spatial computing.The goal of the Experiential Technology Innovation Centre (XTIC) at IIT Madras is to get India ready for the spatial computing wave, which includes using computing in wearables such as augmented, virtual, mixed reality (AR/VR/MR) headsets for a wide range of applications.“India got into AI very late and that is why there is not much innovation happening. We want to prepare India to lead the world in spatial computing,” says Prof M Manivannan, head of XTIC and on the faculty of the department of applied mechanics and biomedical engineering. He believes this is the next big wave in technology.A group of academics and students at IIT-M is working on developing parts for headsets, haptic toolwws or touch sensing technology, biosensors and software. The XTIC has formed a consortium of corporates and startups working purely on experiential (XR) technologies to develop an ecosystem and bring standardisation. Currently there is no standardisation or quality control in applications developed by Indian companies, which hinders industry adoption. The consortium has 400 startups and large enterprises and 700 more are expected to join over the next few months.XTIC is developing tools, standard protocols, learning materials and sharing best practices in this fast-changing field. “Only a public institution such as IITM can bring all the ecosystems together. We do not want to be tied to a particular platform,” says Prof Manivannan.Currently, the biggest challenge for the industry in India is unavailability of headsets, as major products are not launched here. He says India needs to focus on frugal innovation to make this technology affordable.XTIC has formed partnerships with global original equipment makers in XR technologies such as Meta, Qualcomm and Samsung for select research projects. “We are pushing for global players to make their hardware in Chennai where we have electronics and manufacturing strengths,” he adds.In a white paper prepared by the XR consortium, experts argue that there is an urgent need for advanced education as well as research and development in this space. To achieve this, they propose an XR corridor connecting multiple stakeholders across the country.To achieve this, XTIC has formed partnerships with academic institutions for training students. “There are very few people working on the R&D part of it. Most of the XR community in India is working on the application part. We need more people working in hardware and software development,” says Prof Manivannan.We should not just consume technology but create fundamental software tools and take our AR/VR companies to the global market, he adds.“The centre is making efforts to collaborate with global experts so Indian startups and researchers can get visibility outside India. With this, our developers and designers can build the fundamental technology, not just provide services on top of a technology like the information technology sector,” he says.","A group of academics and students at IIT-M is working on developing parts for headsets, haptic toolwws or touch sensing technology, biosensors and software.

TOI explains: What’s behind Trump’s threat of 100% tariff on Brics?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/toi-explains-whats-behind-trumps-threat-of-100-tariff-on-brics/articleshow/115877140.cms,"What is reserve currency?

Sanctions, weaponising the dollar

Incentive to de-dollarise

Cost of highly valued dollar

On Nov 30, US President-elect Donald Trump issued this threat on his social media TruthSocial: ""The idea that the BRICS Countries are trying to move away from the Dollar, while we standby and watch is OVER. We require a commitment from these Countries that they will neither create a new BRICS currency, nor back any other currency to replace the mighty US Dollar or, they will face 100% tariffs, and should expect to say goodbye to selling into the wonderful US Economy.""India is a founding member of BRICS that now has nine member states. US dollar has been the world's most used currency since the end of the second World War, before which UK pound was the most in use. Most countries use dollar for two primary purposes: Currency to hold foreign exchange reserves and currency for trade and other global transactions. The chart below shows dollar's dominant, but declining, position as preferred reserve currencyA reserve currency is a foreign currency that central banks hold as part of its country's formal foreign exchange reserves. By buying and selling currencies on the open market, a central bank, such as RBI, can influence the value of its country's currency (rupee), which can provide stability and maintain investor confidence. Most countries want to hold their reserves in a currency with large and open financial markets, since they want to be sure that they can access their reserves when they need. Central banks often hold currency in the form of govt bonds, such as US treasuries. The US treasury market remains by far the world's largest and most liquid - the easiest to buy into and sell out of - bond market.In addition to accounting for majority of reserves, dollar remains the currency of choice for international trade. Major commodities, such as oil, are primarily bought and sold using US dollar, and some major economies, including Saudi Arabia, still peg their currencies to the dollar.High dollar demand enables US to borrow money at a lower cost, since higher demand for a govt's bonds means it doesn't have to pay as much interest to entice buyers, and helps to keep cost of its huge external debt down. Some experts say this benefit is modest, pointing to the fact that other developed countries are able to borrow at similarly low rates. Former Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke had argued that the US's falling share of the global economy and rise of other currencies, such as euro and yen, have eroded the US advantage.Dollar's centrality to the system of global payments also increases the power of US financial sanctions . Almost all trade done in US dollar, even trade among other countries, can be subject to US sanctions, because they are handled by so-called correspondent banks with accounts at the Federal Reserve. By cutting off the ability to transact in dollar, the US can make it difficult for those it blacklists to do business. For example, in the wake of Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, US sanctions cut Russia off from the dollar, freezing $300 billion in Russian central bank assets and triggering a default on the country's sovereign debt. If use of dollar falls, so will be the effectiveness of US sanctions.Ajay Srivastava, founder of Global Trade Research Initiative, says: ""The US has a history of leveraging its influence over global financial systems, such as the SWIFT network, to impose unilateral sanctions. SWIFT - the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication - is essential for secure and standardised international financial transactions. By blocking countries like Russia and Iran from accessing SWIFT, the US has effectively weaponised the global financial infrastructure, forcing other nations to find alternative payment mechanisms to continue legitimate trade.""Trump's threat is unrealistic. Tariffs of this scale would harm US consumers by raising domestic prices, disrupt global trade, and risk retaliation from key trading partners. A global shift away from dollar is a complex process driven by economic diversification, not easily deterred by threats,"" Srivastava adds.Though dollar still dominates, most economists say its role in the international financial system should not be taken for granted, because there are economic and geopolitical incentives for other countries to 'de-dollarise'. At an April 2023 summit of BRICS countries, Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva asked, ""Why can't we do trade based on our own currencies?""After the US sanctions India's has been buying oil from Russia without using dollar. China too has done the same. But, the idea of developing a BRICS currency hasn't yet taken shape largely due to structural challenges in member countries, including a lack of robust central banks and monetary policies. The share of Chinese Renminbi in global reserves has risen by three times - 1% to 3% - since 2016. This factor may be the primary reason behind Trump's outburst.A highly valued dollar is not without a cost to US. While it makes imports into US cheaper, it makes US exports expensive, which can hurt its industries selling goods abroad and potentially leads to job losses. US is also harmed by currency manipulation - when another country holds down value of its currency to maintain a large trade surplus. If a country keeps the value of its currency artificially low by accumulating dollar reserves, its exports will become more competitive, while US exports will become comparatively more expensive. China has historically been among the worst offenders.While dollar will not be overtaken as the world's leading reserve currency anytime soon, it will slowly come to share influence with other currencies. The trend will be accelerated by the aggressive use of US sanctions and kind of threats Trump issued on Saturday.",US dollar has been the world's most used currency since the end of the second World War.

What's behind global wine production hitting its lowest levels since 1961,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/whats-behind-global-wine-production-hitting-its-lowest-levels-since-1961/articleshow/115815096.cms,"AI-generated image of wine bottles (Picture credit: Canva AI)

Global wine production is expected to fall to its lowest level in over six decades, according to the International Organisation of Vine and Wine (OIV). This decline is primarily attributed to the effects of climate change.The OIV estimates 2024’s total wine production to be between 227 million and 235 million hectoliters. This data comes from 29 countries which represent 85% of global wine production. A mid-range estimate of 231 million hectoliters signifies a 2% decrease compared to 2023 and a 13% drop compared to the average of the preceding 10 years.“Climatic challenges across both hemispheres are once again major contributors to the reduced global production volume,” the OIV said in its report. The organization stressed the impact of extreme weather across key wine regions.“As with 2023, extreme or atypical meteorological events are the key influence on global production, with early frosts, heavy rainfall, and prolonged drought dramatically impacting vineyard productivity .”France, the largest wine producer in 2023, is projected to experience a significant 23% decrease in output. While Italy’s production has slightly rebounded from last year, it is now expected to surpass France as the top producer.The OIV noted some exceptions to the downward trend. “Only a small group of regions -- notably the United States and several Eastern European countries including Hungary, Georgia, and Moldova -- enjoyed more favourable climatic conditions, achieving average or above-average production volumes.”",Global wine production is expected to fall to its lowest level in over six decades.

For clever investors, the crypto market presents unique possibilities. Choosing the correct coins is crucial if you want to turn a meagre investment into an impressive portfolio in the following 10 months. Here we explore seven coins under $10 that offer great growth potential, affordability, and good foundations. Each one has unique qualities that could drive significant returns.Rexas Finance (RXS) is a cutting-edge token leading the tokenisation of real-world assets (RWAs). Having just $0.10 during its stage 8 presale, it has already attracted more than $16.54 million, indicating great investor trust. Designed to enable users to tokenise, trade, and own assets including real estate, commodities, art, and intellectual property—all over a decentralized and borderless platform—a Certik audit helps RXS to establish credibility. The RXS presale assures a 2x return; its official listing price is $0.20. Thanks to its creative approach and great adoption possibility, analysts estimate the token will soar within 10 months. With over 309,000 people vying for $50,000 in prizes, investors can also gain from its $1M giveaway.Rexas Finance is a great choice for creating a $1,000,000 portfolio since experts estimate it could surge more in the next months. Its ability to tokenise RWAs and offer liquidity and accessibility is unmatched in the current market.Its price has increased over 200% in the past month and 22.47% during the last week, showing restored investor confidence and presently at $0.9601 price level. The advanced proof-of-stake consensus mechanism of Cardano has drawn developers and businesses looking for scalable and energy-efficient solutions. Technical signals like good volume balance and RSI above 70 emphasise ADA's great optimistic momentum. Coupled with ongoing ecosystem improvements such as Hydra scaling and Mithral protocol enhancements, Cardano is poised to keep on its increasing trajectory. Cardano is among the top currencies to watch because of its emphasis on innovation and compatibility. ADA has the possibility to provide exponential returns over the next ten months as it keeps confirming its market position.Driven by community support and adoption in major payment systems, DOGE has surged around 300% and over 170% over the past three months, setting its price at $0.3934. The token's break from its horizontal trend channel points to much more positive momentum. Dogecoin is still a favourite for both short-term gains and long-term portfolio expansion even if immediate resistance levels are nowhere to be seen. For those seeking rapid wealth building, its low entry price and significant market presence make it a consistent choice. It has been shown over and again how powerfully Dogecoin rallies during optimistic cycles. Targeting high profits, DOGE is a necessary addition to a diversified crypto portfolio given its present course.With its quick and cheap transfers, XRP still rules the cross-border payment scene. Its most recent 169% price increase in one month and over 25% in the last week highlights growing investor interest, especially following Ripple's partial legal triumph against the SEC. Right now, its price is $1.39. Although the token's RSI above 70 shows great upward momentum, its incorporation into different financial institutions increases its value. The market characteristics of XRP point to a great chance for investors since they indicate that it could shortly go back and exceed its all-time high.XRP is set for exponential expansion with legislative certainty on the horizon and growing acceptance in world payment networks. Anyone trying to optimise returns over the next ten months has to have this.Sui (SUI) is fast-rising among the most exciting initiatives in the blockchain field. Its price doubled in the past month, rising to almost $4 but has reverted to $3.34 as of writing. Attracting developers and users, this Layer 1 blockchain stresses scalability and usability. Sui's strong ecosystem and deliberate alliances set it up for ongoing expansion. Sui is positioned to take a big portion of the market as blockchain usage quickens, therefore driving its price higher. Sui is a strong candidate for a notable price increase based on momentum and creative approach. SUI is a great option for investors wishing to profit from high-growth initiatives.Sei (SEI) is a Layer 1 blockchain made for the best trading performance. With an eye toward speed, dependability, and scalability, Sei has been popular among developers and traders; its price at $0.6684 Its price jumped 87.56% last month; over the past year, long-term gains have exceeded 213%. Sei is a great help in the changing crypto scene since her creative architecture enables the effective completion of difficult financial operations. The recent performance of the token points to ongoing increasing momentum. Long-term investors highly value Sei because of its original value proposition and steady expansion. SEI's price can face exponential increases in the next months as the platform increases the usage cases.Fantom (FTM) is designed for great performance with scalability and speed. FTM is displaying high optimistic momentum with a 61.17% price increase in the last month. In the DeFi ecosystem, its capacity to handle thousands of transactions every second has made it a preferred. With its price of $1.07, Fantom is right on breaking its $1.13 resistance level and might set off a major surge. Its long-term prospects are improved even more by its increasing acceptance in distributed finance and alliances with big companies. Fantom stands to gain more acceptance as DeFi keeps becoming popular. Targeting significant returns, its creative technologies and solid foundations make it a great option.A smart investment plan incorporating high-potential tokens is vital if one wants to establish a $1,000,000 portfolio in the next ten months. Rexas Finance (RXS) is the best choice. At $0.10 in its stage 8 presale, RXS presents an unparalleled starting position for investors. With its innovative real-world asset (RWA) tokenising approach, the token promises a 2x return upon listing at $0.20—expert predictions it might rocket higher. Rexas Finance is reinventing asset management by allowing anybody to tokenise and trade globally real estate, goods, and intellectual property. It's the most dependable token to hold for exponential profits since over $16.54 million was raised, and a Certik audit increased investor confidence. Given RXS's presale pace and growing interest in RWA-oriented projects, allocating a sizable half of your portfolio to it guarantees a good basis. Complementing this core investment, putting 20% in more established tokens like Cardano (ADA) and XRP offers stability and constant expansion possibilities. Both have lately shown amazing upward tendencies, indicating more gains. Allocating 15% to creative tokens like Sui (SUI) and Sei (SEI) would help to capture the advantages of modern blockchain innovations for greater risk, and higher reward exposure. Ten percent in Fantom (FTM) for its DeFi strength and five percent in speculative plays like Dogecoin (DOGE) balance the portfolio. Rexas Finance (RXS) is still the crown gem of this approach since it presents unmatched growth possibilities and positions itself as the finest investment to get a $1,000,000 portfolio.For more information about Rexas Finance (RXS) visit the links below:Website: https://rexas.com Whitepaper: https://rexas.com/rexas-whitepaper.pdf Twitter/X: https://x.com/rexasfinance Telegram: https://t.me/rexasfinance",Rexas Finance (RXS) is a cutting-edge token leading the tokenisation of real- world assets.

2024 ‘Black Friday’ sale targets inflation stricken US customers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/2024-black-friday-sale-targets-inflation-stricken-us-customers/articleshow/115789592.cms,"As November ends, Black Friday kicks off the US holiday shopping season , a time known for finding the best deals. However, this year, retailers are preparing for shoppers who are more focused than ever on finding the best bargains and maximizing the value of their money.Though inflation has stabilized after the substantial price hikes during the Covid pandemic, consumers are still feeling the financial strain. Consequently, bargain-hunting strategies like grabbing early giveaways and waiting for last-minute steals have become a trend.Vivek Pandya, leading insights analyst at Adobe Digital Insights told AFP that as compared to previous years, 2024 holiday shoppers are ""even more preoccupied and very focused around value and discounts.""""We do see stronger price sensitivity on the part of the consumer and they are very responsive to deals and event-tie deals,"" he said.This year, consumers have eagerly participated in special discount events like Memorial Day sales and Amazon's ""Prime Day.""Black Friday, marking the beginning of the gifting season, falls the day after Thanksgiving and kicks off a busy shopping weekend that also includes ""Small Business Saturday"" and ""Cyber Monday.""To combat the ever evolving concern of inflation, major retailers like Target have shifted their ""Black Friday"" promotions to October or even earlier.Consumer prices on average were 22 percent higher in August 2024 compared with January 2020, according to Pew Research, and popular discontent with inflation is one reason Donald Trump won the US presidency in November.In August 2024, prices surged by an average of 22 percent compared to January 2020, according to Pew Research. Inflation is also believed to have played a role in Donald Trump's victory in the November elections.Inflation continues to influence retailers' discounting strategies as they aim to meet the demands of the market.At Target, shoppers have become accustomed to gathering at the chain's ""Circle Week"" savings events, held almost once every quarter. These events have resulted in reduction in purchases a week before and after the events, as per the executives.After a lengthy period of inflation, ""consumers tell us their budgets remain stretched,"" Target CEO Brian Cornell told analysts.""They're becoming increasingly resourceful in their shopping behaviors, waiting to buy until (the) last moment of need, focusing on deals and then stocking up when they find them,"" he said.For the 2024 season, the National Retail Federation has forecasted holiday spending growth of 2.5 to 3.5 percent, compared to the previous year, reaching as much as $989 billion over the two-month period.Economists have pointed to an easing of gasoline prices as a supportive factor, along with an ebbing in the costs of some food items.Economists also signalled lowered prices for certain food items, supported by relaxation in gasoline prices.The inflationary environment has had a particularly weighted down lower-income households, with banks citing rising charge-off rates as a sign of growing financial stress.However, some chains, like off-price apparel retailer Burlington Stores, have seen improvements for this group of consumers. According to Burlington CEO Michael O'Sullivan, some of the company’s strongest sales have come from stores located in low-income zip codes.""Maybe for the first time since 2021, it looks like their real incomes are finally edging up,"" O'Sullivan said on a conference call this week.Thanksgiving, which always falls on the fourth Thursday in November, lands on its latest possible date in 2024. As a result, retailers are adjusting to a holiday season that is five days shorter than last year.A week before the national holiday marking the start of the gifting season, the electronics chain Best Buy also kicked off its Black Friday sale. This year, it reintroduced its ""Doorbuster"" sales every Friday, both in stores and online—an event many retailers had discontinued in recent years due to concerns over crowded lines and the risk of injury.Adobe Digital Insights reported on Wednesday that online sales during the first 24 days of the holiday season had increased by 9.6 percent year-over-year, surpassing the 8.4 percent growth projected for the season.","In August 2024, prices surged by an average of 22 percent compared to January 2020, according to Pew Research. Inflation is also believed to have played a role in Donald Trump's victory in the November elections.

"Japanese banks sticking with Adani as Jefferies, Barclays review ties",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/japanese-banks-sticking-with-adani-as-jefferies-barclays-review-ties/articleshow/115788415.cms,"Stock Tumbles

Japan’s biggest banks plan to maintain ties to billionaire Gautam Adani despite US bribery charges, even as other global firms including Barclays Plc are reassessing their exposure to the Indian conglomerate.Mizuho Financial Group Inc. expects the latest saga surrounding Adani won’t have a long-lasting impact and intends to continue supporting the group, according to people familiar with the matter. Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc. and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. also have no plans to pull back and will be open to fresh financing if needed later, people familiar with the matter said.Tokyo-based spokespeople for all three lenders declined to comment. An Adani Group representative didn’t comment immediately.The Japanese support underscores the divide among finance firms over Adani after he and others were charged with plotting a $250 million scheme to bribe India government officials to win solar energy contracts. Adani’s massive ports-to-power group has denied the charges and called the allegations baseless. Its representatives have been meeting with lenders and investors to reassure them and explain its stance on the matter.While it’s unlikely there’ll be new financing requests by the group for now, some global banks that are concerned about reputational risk are curbing their exposure to one of India’s biggest conglomerates. The capital-rich Japanese lenders take comfort that they’re backing cash-generative assets. Adani has strong government ties and any legal processes brought by the US will take a long time, according to the people familiar.“Drawing from their experiences in Southeast Asia in the ‘90s, Japanese banks have developed sophisticated frameworks for evaluating emerging-market risks,” Ben Charoenwong, an associate finance professor at Insead in Singapore, said about the lenders’ risk tolerance in the aftermath of the Asian Financial Crisis. “Banks like MUFG and SMBC, which view India as a crucial growth market, are unlikely to substantially reduce their overall India exposure” though they may tighten processes or raise risk premiums for certain deals.Meanwhile, Barclays, which has long been a go-to bank for Adani, has suspended extending new loans or financing to the group for now, according to people familiar with the matter.The British lender had been gradually decreasing its exposure in direct lending and bond underwriting since short seller Hindenburg Research took aim at the company last year, Bloomberg News earlier reported. Still, it provided part of a $394 million trade-finance facility last year to an Adani unit for a solar module plant. Earlier this year, Barclays was among bookrunners for a $409 million bond sale by Adani Green Energy Ltd.A Barclays spokesperson declined to comment on its exposure to Adani or the status of its relationship with the group.Jefferies Financial Group Inc., which stood by Adani after Hindenburg accused the conglomerate of fraud, hasn’t discussed new dealings with the group after further accusations surfaced following the US indictment, according to people familiar with the matter. The bank hasn’t made a formal decision on whether to pause or halt deals, and is awaiting a firm outcome from the charges before engaging in new business, the people said.Jefferies held some Adani shares temporarily on its balance sheet as a market maker, but not as an investment in the firm, the people said. The Adani Group represents less than 4 per cent of Jefferies’s India business, they added.The India arm of Jefferies last year brokered a $1.9 billion sale of shares in four Adani Group companies to GQG Partners, a Florida-based investment firm. More recently, Jefferies was a lead manager as the flagship Adani Enterprises Ltd. and other companies raised $500 million from stock sales last month.A representative for the New York-based firm declined to comment.Meanwhile, at least two other major US banks that were aiming to grab a small share of debt funding from the Adani group in recent months have now put those efforts on hold, according to people familiar.Japan’s biggest lenders, which recently raised their annual profit forecasts to fresh records, feature prominently in some of the biggest overseas bond deals this year by Indian companies, including Adani Group, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Most recently, they were among the arrangers of a planned $600 million bond sale by Adani Green that was canceled after the charges became public.Mizuho isn’t too concerned about the current investigation and has no intention of pulling back from the group, which hasn’t reneged on any payments, the people familiar said. Mizuho has helped finance Adani units running ports and airports, which are steady cash generators.Sumitomo and Mitsubishi UFJ are confident in the companies’ ability to repay borrowings and don’t expect the businesses to be affected much, the people said.Like their Japanese peers, some Middle East banks such as Emirates NBD Bank PJSC are equally unfazed about their relationship with Adani, the people said. They have no plans to pull back from existing commitments and will lend fresh money for future projects on the back of their regular diligence processes, the people said, adding that their capital was committed to good assets in the Adani portfolio. Emirates NBD declined to comment.“Japanese and Middle Eastern banks, with access to relatively low-cost capital, are actively exploring global growth and diversification opportunities,” said Ashutosh Mishra, head of research at the institutional desk of Ashika Stock Broking Ltd. “This creates a synergistic fit with asset-heavy Indian conglomerates like Adani, which offer a robust growth outlook.”Adani’s dollar bonds and stocks tumbled immediately following the indictment, indicating investors were spooked about rising risk. In the past week, S&P Global Ratings, Moody’s Ratings and Fitch Ratings have all lowered their credit outlooks on some Adani companies to negative from stable. S&P cited funding access and financing-cost concerns. Fitch also said it may cut its rating on Adani Ports & Special Economic Zone Ltd.’s dollar bonds to junk.Companies in other sectors are also reassessing their ties to Adani. TotalEnergies SE said it won’t make any fresh investment in the group until the consequences of the US indictments have been clarified. Kenya meanwhile canceled two Adani contracts worth about $2.6 billion in the wake of the charges.Adani Enterprises’s shares tumbled 23 per cent on Nov. 21 following the US move, but have since recouped some of those losses. The stock rallied this week after the company said Gautam Adani and his aides have not been charged under the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.",Mizuho Financial Group Inc. expects the latest saga surrounding Adani won’t have a long-lasting impact. Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group also have no plans to pull back and will be open to fresh financing if needed later.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115788472,imgsize-23056,width-400,resizemode-4/115788472.jpg"

The GDP of the world's largest economy has exceeded 2% in eight out of the past nine quarters.The GDP data also revealed that a measure of the economy's fundamental strength which includes consumer spending and private investment and excludes variable components such as exports, inventories and government expenditure, increased at a robust 3.2% annual rate from July through September, improving from 2.7% in the April-June period.Consumer expenditure, representing approximately 70% of US economic activity, grew to a 3.5% annual rate in the last quarter, rising from 2.8% in April-June and marking the fastest increase since the fourth quarter of 2023. Exports also enhanced third-quarter growth, rising at a 7.5% rate, the highest in two years.However, both consumer spending and export growth were below the Commerce Department's initial projections.Business investment growth decelerated notably due to reduced investment in residential properties and commercial structures like offices and warehouses, although equipment expenditure increased significantly.The incoming President-elect will assume leadership of a generally stable economy when he takes office next month.The economic indicators show stability.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume.While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor ( CEA ) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview.That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran Udaan until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.Udaan built an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business still accounts for a very small part of India’s overall retail market but can balloon to $150 billion in sales and yield a 100% return on capital invested in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co. estimates published in the Mint newspaper.Bengaluru-based Udaan has also ventured into financing through its fintech unit which helps shopkeepers get working capital loans to buy inventory. That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says.

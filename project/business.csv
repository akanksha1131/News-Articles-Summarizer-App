Piyush Goyal Sends Strong Reply To Donald Trump, Says India Wants Fair But Balanced Trade Agreement

India-US trade deal: 3-point strategy India should adopt

End oil imports from sanctioned Russian firms. Trump has acknowledged that India has largely done this, so Step 1 is complete, says GTRI.

Secure tariff rollback before trade talks. With Russian oil imports curtailed, India should press Washington to withdraw the 25% “Russian oil” tariff. This would reduce the overall US duty burden on Indian goods from 50% to 25%, boosting competitiveness in sectors like textiles, gems and jewellery, and pharmaceuticals without rushing into a full trade deal, it says.

Resume trade negotiations after tariffs come down to 25%. Once duties are rolled back, India should restart talks for a balanced trade agreement, aiming for parity with partners like the EU and targeting average industrial tariffs of about 15%, it adds.

India-US trade deal: What’s the status?





With US President Donald Trump hinting at a trade deal soon, Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI) founder Ajay Srivastava says that India should push for rollback of 25% tariffs on account of Russian crude oil. Srivastava is of the view that before finalizing the trade deal, India should insist on America dropping the penal tariff, especially as Trump has himself claimed that India has substantially dropped its Russian crude oil trade.President Trump indicated on Monday that he plans to lower tariffs on India in the future, acknowledging that his trade policies had strained bilateral relations whilst again claiming that India has significantly reduced Russian oil imports.During the Oval Office ceremony for Sergio Gor's swearing-in as the new ambassador to India, Trump remarked, ""So right now, they don't love me, but they'll love us again."" When discussing potential trade agreements, he simply stated, ""I think we're pretty close to doing a deal that's good for everybody,"" without providing specific details about timing or remaining obstacles.GTRI proposes a 3-point approach for India: finalise withdrawal from sanctioned Russian oil trading, get the US to reverse 25% Russian oil duty to enhance market access, and subsequently engage in balanced trade discussions with the US as equals.GTRI also points out that India could potentially benefit from awaiting the US Supreme Court's verdict on Trump tariffs. Should previous rulings be upheld and the tariffs invalidated, India would be better positioned to negotiate a fair and progressive trade agreement with the US, without the constraints of unilateral duties.The US Supreme Court has commenced hearings on a significant case regarding presidential authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose such tariffs. Several justices expressed doubts about whether the legislation permits such extensive authority. A ruling against Trump would render these tariffs unlawful and require their withdrawal, potentially influencing global trade patterns and directly impacting US-India trade discussions.The trade negotiations between India and the US appear to be reaching completion, with additional discussions becoming less likely. The Indian government maintains its stance on achieving a fair outcome.At an event, Commerce & Industry Minister Piyush Goyal said, ""We are working for a good trade deal in the interest of India. We want a fair, equitable, and balanced trade deal with the US. If that happens, it could happen any day, tomorrow, next month, or next year. But as a government, we are preparing for everything.""A high-ranking official told TOI that discussions with the US have largely concluded, with no additional rounds anticipated.The official noted, ""They (the US) have to get back to us. It's the most comprehensive, WTO-compliant treaty compared to any other nation. We negotiated very cautiously, keeping in mind the sensitivities of key sectors. There is no deadline.""Following five rounds of official-level discussions, with involvement from Goyal and External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar with their American counterparts, progress appears promising.",US President Trump indicated on Monday that he plans to lower tariffs on India in the future.

Why investors are upbeat



Analysts’ view: Buy, sell, or hold?

Iveco acquisition adds global potential



(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market, other asset classes or personal finance management tips given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India.)





Shares of Tata Motors Commercial Vehicles Ltd (TMLCV), the newly demerged commercial vehicle arm of Tata Motors , made a robust debut on Wednesday, listing at a premium of over 26%–28% to its implied value..The stock opened at Rs 335 on the NSE, up 28.5% from the implied value of Rs 260.75 and at Rs 330.25 on the BSE, a 26.6% gain.Post listing, it rose further to Rs 345 on the NSE, reflecting solid investor enthusiasm for India’s largest truck and bus maker.Analysts cited optimism about India’s commercial vehicle upcycle and infrastructure growth as key drivers.Jahol Prajapati, research analyst at Samco Securities, was quoted by ET as saying that the demerger “separates the fast-growing passenger vehicle and EV business from the more stable, cash-generating CV business, allowing investors to value each on its own strength.”He noted that shareholders will get one share of TMLCV for every Tata Motors share held, with no dilution of ownership.According to ET, TMLCV reported FY25 revenue of Rs 75,055 crore and EBITDA of Rs 8,856 crore, implying an 11.8% margin.Prajapati added, “Using Ashok Leyland’s EV/EBITDA multiple of 12.9x, the fair value for TMLCV comes around Rs 1.14 lakh crore, or roughly Rs 310–Rs 320 per share.” He said the listing “removes the conglomerate discount and gives investors a focused bet on India’s commercial vehicle upcycle.”Brokerages remain broadly positive but advise caution on near-term volatility.Ambit Institutional Equities called the demerger “a separation of value and growth propositions,” stating that “the CV business is better positioned to capitalise on the demerger” and could see “immediate value unlocking.”SBI Securities values the CV arm between Rs 320 and Rs 470 per share.Harshal Dasani, business head at INVasset PMS, said, “For investors, this listing presents a dual-edged opportunity — a sharp, India-centric commercial vehicle play aligned with freight and infrastructure growth, but also early-stage listing risks and cyclicality in margins.”He recommended that long-term investors “hold the stock in a medium-term portfolio with a three-to-five-year horizon.”According to ET, analysts see Tata Motors’ pending acquisition of Italy’s Iveco Group NV’s commercial vehicle operations for €3.8 billion as a transformative step.Dasani said, “The Iveco acquisition adds technological heft but will take time to reflect in earnings,” calling it a “long-term strategic catalyst” that could make TMLCV a global contender in medium and heavy commercial vehicles.In the near term, analysts expect some volatility as funds rebalance post-demerger but believe that GDP-linked demand recovery, infrastructure expansion, and emission-led upgrades will gradually support the stock’s trajectory.","Shares of Tata Motors Commercial Vehicles Ltd (TMLCV) made a robust debut on Wednesday, listing at a premium of over 26%–28% to its implied value.

Gold Price Outlook

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market, other asset classes or personal finance management tips given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)





Gold price ended last week almost flat showing consolidated moves while positive developments over US Shutdown reopening over the weekend revived prospects for rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve (Fed) in December shifting focus back to deteriorating US Fiscal outlook. US private jobs data released last week indicated a weak labour market, further supporting the US rate cut prospects. US Challenger job data also indicated a spike in job cuts, suggesting a possible cooling in US labour market conditions.CME Fed funds tool showed rate cut possibility for December 10 -11 meeting have risen to above 90 % now from around 66 % yesterday. Worries about the potential economic fallout from the longest-ever US government shutdown turned out to be a key factor that continued to underpin demand for the safe-haven commodity as the yellow metal rose to three week highs in the current week.Inflation concerns also persisted as President Donald Trump floated the idea of sending American rebate checks of at least $ 2000 a person (excluding high income people) for the tariffs that his administration has collected which provided additional support to yellow metal.In other news, China central bank continued to buy gold for 12th Consecutive month as data showed China's official gold reserves stood at 74.09 MOz at the end of October up 74.06 Moz from a month earlier, which meant PBoC bought nearly one tonne which continued to boost sentiments in Gold.Meanwhile spot silver rose more than 4 % to above $50 per oz, reaching its highest since October 21. The US, which added copper, and silver to its critical minerals list, also provided structural support for precious and industrial metals. However, the supply shortage which persisted in October has likely eased now indicating an unlikely scenario for new highs in spot, but prices could still find support from uncertain economic conditions in the US which could keep safe haven flows intact in white metal.In the near term, gold is expected to test its resistance zone around $ 4190 – 4210 per oz (CMP $ 4135/Oz) while buying on dips could remain a favourable strategy for the metal. Support for the yellow metal could persist in the range of $ 4110 – 4075 per oz in near term. On MCX futures (CMP 124,850/10 gm) prices are expected to witness strong supports in the range of 1,23,800 – 1,22,900 per 10 gm levels in near term as resistance on higher side to remain at around Rs, 1,26,500 – 1,27,900 /10 gm levels for the week.Looking ahead for the week, volatility in prices could also occur at higher levels driven by fluctuations in the dollar index and global financial market as traders could closely monitor the US October Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation data later on Thursday. The headline CPI is expected to show an increase of 0.2% MoM in October, while the core CPI is projected to show a rise of 0.3% MoM during the same period. The US Retail Sales will be in the spotlight on Friday.Silver could also trade with a positive bias as a rise towards $ 52. 20 - 52.50 per oz (CMP $ 51.10/Oz) in spot cannot be ruled out in near term. Strong support could persist in the range of $ 50.20 – 49.50 /Oz levels. On MCX futures contract (CMP Rs. 1,55,500/Kg.) This could translate to a support level of Rs. 1,52,500–1,50,800 / Kg & resistance at Rs 1,58,000 - 1,59,500/Kg levels for the week.","Gold prices are expected to face upside resistance, and buying on dips may be a favourable strategy, says Maneesh Sharma, AVP - Commodities & Currencies, Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers.

Groww made a strong debut on Dalal Street on Wednesday, with shares listing on both the BSE and NSE at a premium over the issue price.Shares of Billionbrains Garage Ventures Ltd (Groww) listed at Rs 114 apiece on the BSE, marking a 14% premium over the IPO price of Rs 100. On the NSE, the stock debuted at Rs 112 per share, up 12% from the issue price.The Bengaluru-based fintech platform’s Rs 6,632 crore IPO was among the most anticipated issues of 2025, and the positive listing reflects steady investor confidence in India’s growing digital investing ecosystem.The grey market premium (GMP) for Groww IPO stood at Rs 3 per share as of Tuesday evening, down from Rs 16 on the day the issue opened, as reported by ET. The muted GMP had suggested a likely listing premium of around 4–5%, but the stock exceeded those expectations by opening 12–14% higher on debut.Analysts said the stronger-than-expected listing signals investor optimism toward fintech growth despite regulatory headwinds.As per ET, Prashanth Tapse, Sr VP Research at Mehta Equities, said, “At listing, Groww’s implied valuation appears justifiable, backed by rapid customer growth (over 10 crore users), strong brand recall in retail investing, rising market share in F&O and mutual fund distribution, and a scalable digital business model with low incremental cost.”Analysts tracking the stock remain cautiously optimistic. Raj Gaikar, Research Analyst at Samco Securities, was quoted by ET as saying, “For investors who have received allotments, we recommend holding the stock for at least 2–3 years, as we anticipate further upside over that period, given Groww’s profitability and strong revenue growth.”He noted that Groww’s valuation at 33x FY25 earnings is slightly higher than peers such as Motilal Oswal Financial Services (29x) and Angel One (31x).Prashanth Tapse of Mehta Equities also advised investors to stay invested, saying, “Those allotted shares should hold through listing, while new investors can consider entering post-listing if valuations remain reasonable and business momentum continues — particularly on any post-listing dips as a potential entry point.”Founded in 2017, Groww operates a direct-to-customer digital investment platform that allows users to invest in mutual funds, stocks, F&O, ETFs, IPOs, digital gold, and U.S. stocks. The app is particularly popular among mutual fund investors.The company also provides margin trading, algorithmic trading, credit facilities, and new fund offers (NFOs) to enhance user engagement.Its customer base includes both first-time investors and affluent clients, contributing to a healthy mix of revenue streams.The IPO comprised a fresh issue of Rs 1,060 crore and an offer for sale (OFS) of Rs 5,572 crore by existing shareholders. Proceeds from the fresh issue will fund cloud infrastructure, marketing, and capital infusion into subsidiaries such as Groww Creditserv Tech and Groww Invest Tech.Kotak Mahindra Capital, JP Morgan India, Citigroup Global Markets India, Axis Capital, and Motilal Oswal Investment Advisors were the Book Running Lead Managers, while MUFG Intime India Private Limited served as the Registrar.In FY25, Groww reported operating revenue of Rs 3,901 crore, up 49% YoY, and a PAT of Rs 1,824 crore, marking a strong turnaround from previous losses.Its EBITDA margin rose to 60.8%, supported by organic user growth and reduced marketing costs.The company’s AARPU (average revenue per user) improved to Rs 3,339 in FY25 from Rs 2,541 in FY23, showing higher profitability from its affluent investor base.Despite solid growth, analysts remain cautious due to SEBI’s tightening oversight of the F&O segment, a key revenue driver for Groww and other discount brokers.Potential restrictions on weekly options and stricter margin norms could impact trading volumes and revenue growth.At the upper price band, Groww’s valuation of 33.8x FY25 P/E is higher than peers like Angel One (19x) and Anand Rathi Wealth (25x), but analysts believe the premium is justified given Groww’s technology edge, brand visibility and expanding retail franchise.Groww is the first new-age wealthtech firm to list on the Indian bourses, marking a major milestone for the fintech ecosystem.While listing gains may be moderate, the company’s long-term prospects hinge on diversifying beyond F&O and scaling its wealth management offerings amid increasing regulatory scrutiny.","Groww made a strong debut on Dalal Street on Wednesday, with shares listing on both the BSE and NSE at a premium over the issue price.

US government shutdown: Supreme Court extends block on Snap payments; hopes rise for potential end to standoff,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-govt-shutdown-supreme-court-extends-block-on-snap-payments-hopes-rise-for-potential-end-to-standoff/articleshow/125263032.cms,"1000+ Flights Cancelled As Shutdown Severely Impacts American Aviation Sector

Snap benefits









The US Supreme Court had, once again, refused to order the Trump administration to provide full funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap). Instead it has chosen to allow congress additional time to resolve the matter through a possible agreement tied to ending the government shutdown.In an order issued on Tuesday (local time), the justices extended a temporary halt on a lower court ruling that had required the administration to release full food benefit payments. The stay remains active until November 13, effectively putting the funding issue on hold without the court examining the legal arguments of either side.The dispute reached the Supreme Court after Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, who handles emergency requests from the 1st US Circuit Court of Appeals’ jurisdiction, paused a district court-imposed deadline for the payments while the appeals judges reviewed the case.Jackson, one of the court’s liberal justices, approved an emergency request from the administration, even though the matter involves a programme strongly supported by Democrats. In the latest order, Jackson stated she disagreed with the court’s decision to keep the pause in place on full Snap funding.Meanwhile, lawmakers are racing to reach a broader deal. The House of Representatives is expected to vote on Wednesday on a plan to reopen the government through January 30.That proposal includes full-year funding for several federal agencies and services, covering food assistance and benefits for veterans.The department of justice has warned the Supreme Court that judicial intervention risks complicating shutdown negotiations.Government lawyers, according to USA Today, have argued that the lower courts introduced a “massively inappropriate new variable” and disrupted the operation of Snap. Solicitor General John Sauer wrote, ""Congress appears to be on the brink of breaking the deadlock, though that outcome is unsure.”“The district court’s unlawful orders risk upsetting that compromise and throwing into doubt how innumerable critical federal programs will be funded,"" Sauer was further quoted by the agency.The legal fight began when the US district judge John McConnell in Rhode Island ordered the administration to use contingency Snap funds and other available money to ensure full November payments reached states by November 7. The appeals court sided with McConnell, ruling that the danger of leaving tens of millions of Americans without adequate food support outweighed the administration’s objections to using alternative funds.The groups opposing the Trump administration have argued that Snap recipients had “now gone ten days without the help they need to afford food,” warning that millions of Americans, including children, were already going hungry.Almost 42 million people across the country rely on food stamps, which are distributed in phases throughout the month. According to Code for America, an organisation that helps governments improve access to public benefit programmes, about 27 million of them should have received their payments by Monday.US households, according to CNN, on an average get roughly $350 a month to purchase food, but for many families, that money runs out quickly.","The US Supreme Court extended a temporary halt on a lower court ruling that had required the administration to release full food benefit payments.

New Delhi: Over the last 12 months Hafele India, the local arm of the German furniture fittings and architectural hardware firm, has trebled the share of domestically sourced products to 30%.""When I came to India three years ago, I was looking to drive localisation and quality control orders have helped accelerate that drive as it has helped improve quality, where India is a bit behind,"" said Frank Scholeder Hafele, the MD of the Indian arm.It's the same story across insulated flask manufacturing units and the screw industry. Vikas Jain of Nanobot Houseware Solutions, says that since the QCOs (quality control orders) were announced, 75 licences have been issued to domestic manufacturers, with big names such as Milton, Cello and Borosil now focusing on domestic production.Similarly, Jasbir Singh of the association representing screw manufacturers in North India, says that small units in Amritsar have expanded capacity by two-three times in the last few months as the QCOs have restricted the entry of products from China, which cost around Rs 70 a kg thanks to subsidy, compared to locally produced ones at Rs 129 a kg.While companies are expanding, the recent moves to review QCOs and ease some of them have caused anxiety.""You need stability of policy. We are for localisation in certain product categories and it (QCOs) should not be rolled back,"" said Hafele, while advocating that the norms should first be implemented for finished products and the ecosystem will evolve for intermediate goods over a period of time.""The manufacturing initiative will slow down if QCOs are removed,"" added Jain of Nanobat, adding that exports to countries, such as Japan and UAE, have picked up and global chains are now sourcing products for their Indian operations.Anil Bedi of the Roller Chain Manufacturer Association blames the ""powerful importer lobby"" for the noise.

Semicon startups see near 6-fold rise in early-stage funding: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/semicon-startups-see-near-6-fold-rise-in-early-stage-funding-report/articleshow/125289538.cms,"



BENGALURU: India's semiconductor ecosystem is gaining strong momentum, with early-stage venture capital funding rising from $5 million in 2023 to $28 million in 2024, according to venture fund Capital-A's report. Most of it came through seed funding rounds averaging $3 million, showed the Semicon Report. By mid-2025, the sector already surpassed last year's total, with $44 million committed till July.""Majority of the ones that are raised are fabless,"" the report noted, citing Mindgrove, Agnit and Incore among key players. Supported by govt incentives under the PLI scheme, 23 chip design projects have been approved, while projects worth $18 million have been cleared under the India Semiconductor Mission.According to Capital-A, India is emerging as a hub for downstream activities, such as electronic device integration, material recovery and testing, marking, packaging, and pure-play foundries - areas that demand scale but are less capital-intensive. However, India still has limited presence in high-capital segments, like input material manufacturing.""India's strategy should not be to merely replicate what worked out for its peers.It should focus on building partnerships, while simultaneously developing IPs in niche adjacencies,"" the report said. The report highlights strong potential for fabless start-ups to evolve into global IP-led innovators, paving the way for commercial maturity.Despite past hurdles like policy delays and infrastructure gaps, the domestic semiconductor market is poised for growth - fuelled by startup activity, global collaborations, and an IP-focused funding ecosystem targeting advanced materials and manufacturing for import substitution.","India's semiconductor ecosystem is gaining strong momentum.

Switch Mobility is shutting down its UK plant and shifting production to its Ras Al Khaimah (RAK), UAE facility to cut costs and improve efficiency. ""A few months ago, we decided to shut down Switch's Sherburn, UK, facility as operating there was no longer viable. We have since shifted the manufacturing of Switch buses to our RAK plant in the UAE, where we are investing under $3 million to produce buses for the UK and European markets. RAK offers better market access to Europe and the GCC, along with a more efficient cost structure,"" said Shenu Agarwal, MD & CEO, Ashok Leyland . ""While Switch India is doing very well, after this restructuring we expect to perform much better in international markets as well, particularly in electric buses,"" he added.Meanwhile, Switch India has turned PAT-positive in H1FY26. K M Balaji, CFO of the company, attributed the turnaround to tighter cost control, and higher domestic volumes. Unlike many EV makers that run standalone factories, Switch leverages Leyland's manufacturing infrastructure for ""gliders"" - vehicle shells without batteries or powertrains .

Shutdown strain: Small US businesses reel under halted contracts; firms weigh layoffs as Congress moves to end deadlock,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/shutdown-strain-small-us-businesses-reel-under-halted-contracts-firms-weigh-layoffs-as-congress-moves-to-end-deadlock/articleshow/125280380.cms,"U.S Shutdown Twist: Inside Capitol Hill’s 36-Hour Sprint to Reopen America; All Eyes On House Dems





Small businesses across the United States that rely on federal contracts and funding are facing a severe cash crunch as the country’s longest-ever government shutdown stretches into its seventh week, forcing owners to cut costs, delay payments, and even consider layoffs, according to AP report.Lawmakers are returning to Washington to vote on a stopgap funding bill that would reopen the government through January 30. While the measure is expected to pass the Republican-controlled House despite opposition from most Democrats, small business owners say the shutdown has already caused deep disruptions that will take months to recover from.For entrepreneurs like Jackson Dalton, owner of Black Box Safety, a California-based maker of protective gear, the shutdown’s effects have been immediate. Dalton had secured a $1.9 million federal contract just a day before the shutdown began on October 1, requiring an initial $1 million outlay. “It’s had a major impact on our cash flow and operations,” he told AP, adding that suppliers had been “freaking out” as they awaited new orders.For some business owners, the uncertainty has led to difficult choices. Eric Veal, founder of Interactive Knowledge in North Carolina — which develops digital exhibits for museums and cultural institutions — said 60% of his business depends on the Smithsonian Institution, which operates under partial federal funding.With federal staff unable to work, “projects are at a complete halt,” he said.Veal has cut expenses and may be forced to consider layoffs if the shutdown extends beyond mid-November. “Our cash flow is affected, and we’ve marked November 15 on the calendar as the date to start considering those steps,” he said, noting that the crisis had made him rethink his company’s reliance on federal projects.The prolonged shutdown has also overshadowed other business priorities. At a recent Goldman Sachs 10,000 Small Businesses summit in Washington, attended by around 2,000 entrepreneurs, participants said their planned discussions on access to capital, AI adoption, and workforce policies were derailed by uncertainty around government operations.Joe Gelardi, CEO of Virginia-based Vectrona, which provides technology and training to defence clients, said his firm had not received payments for ongoing contracts. “We keep working because we don’t want to harm the relationship with our government customers,” he said. “But it’s really unfortunate that the burden is being transferred to us to fund and manage work the government can’t process.”Some businesses are facing outright cancellations. Karen Jenkins, founder of KRJ Consulting in South Carolina, said a major management consulting contract that was supposed to be renewed this year was scrapped amid the shutdown. “It’s affected us almost as badly as the pandemic,” she said. “We’re just trying to hold on and hope we can be a resource again when the government reopens.”Economists warn that small contractors are among the hardest hit by the impasse since they typically lack the reserves that large corporations can rely on during prolonged funding freezes. Even after the shutdown ends, many may face months of backlog, delayed payments, and lost business opportunities as federal agencies scramble to restart operations.As one small business owner put it: “We’ve survived on resilience before — but this time, even resilience is starting to run out.”",Small businesses across the U.S. that rely on federal contracts and funding are facing a severe cash crunch.

US stocks moved in mixed trade on Wednesday as investors balanced renewed enthusiasm for artificial intelligence (AI) plays with lingering concerns over inflated tech valuations and slowing economic signals. The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged 309 points, or 0.6%, to hit another record, while the S&P 500 dipped 0.1%, staying close to its all-time high. The Nasdaq Composite, weighed down by tech losses, slipped 0.5%, AP reported.Chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) led market gains, jumping 9.6% after CEO Lisa Su forecast that the company’s revenue could grow at an annual compounded rate above 35% over the next three to five years, driven by what she called “accelerating AI momentum.” The upbeat outlook gave investors a boost after several volatile sessions for AI-linked stocks.However, analysts said concerns remain that the current rally in artificial intelligence shares mirrors the excesses of the early 2000s dot-com bubble. Nvidia, the sector’s bellwether, oscillated between gains and losses during the session after sliding 4.6% this month. Despite dominating AI chipmaking, its stock’s meteoric rise — doubling in four of the last five years — has left investors debating whether prices have outpaced fundamentals.Wall Street’s broader advance has been fuelled by tech megacaps, even as parts of the US economy show signs of cooling. IBM rose 2.3% after announcing what it called a breakthrough in “bringing truly useful quantum computing to the world,” according to Jay Gambetta, director of IBM Research. The development marks another step in the race among major tech firms to commercialise quantum computing and tackle complex problems traditional systems can’t handle.Elsewhere, On Holdings, the Swiss sportswear company, soared 20.3% after reporting a much larger-than-expected quarterly profit, while Circle Internet Group, a major cryptocurrency issuer, tumbled nearly 10% despite strong earnings. The stock has plunged from almost $300 in June to below $90 amid weakening sentiment toward crypto-linked equities.In the bond market, the yield on the benchmark 10-year US Treasury note eased to 4.06% from 4.13% after trading resumed following Tuesday’s Veterans Day holiday. Lower yields typically make equities more attractive by reducing returns on bonds. Traders continue to price in a roughly two-thirds chance that the Federal Reserve will deliver a rate cut in December, data from CME Group showed.However, Fed Chair Jerome Powell recently cautioned that another cut this year is “far from certain,” warning against fuelling inflation, which remains above the central bank’s 2% target. The Fed’s visibility has also been hindered by the ongoing US government shutdown — the longest in history — which has paused the release of key data on inflation, jobs, and consumer spending. Economists say this data gap complicates policy decisions and adds uncertainty to markets.Globally, equities gained ground. France’s CAC 40 climbed 1.2%, South Korea’s Kospi gained 1.1%, and Japan’s Nikkei 225 advanced 0.4%. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index rose 0.9%, while China’s Shanghai Composite closed nearly flat.Analysts said investor sentiment remains cautiously optimistic as hopes of an imminent end to the US shutdown and expectations for AI-led growth continue to counterbalance valuation concerns in tech-heavy sectors.","The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged 309 points, or 0.6%, to hit another record.

The TOI correspondent from Washington:

'You Don’t Have Talent in US': Donald Trump’s Shocking Shift on H-1B Visa Policy Debate





US President Donald Trump’s blunt declaration that America “doesn’t have certain talents” detonated an epic meltdown across MAGA circles on Wednesday, with his Fox News interview that touched on the subject of H1-B visas and foreign students exposing a widening chasm between the MAGA boss and his base.“No, you don’t—no you don’t,” Trump snapped when Fox News’ Laura Ingraham insisted during an interview that the U.S. already has “plenty of talented people,” arguing that if the President wanted to raise wages for American workers, he can’t flood the country hundreds of thousands of foreign workers,”“I agree—but you also do have to bring in talent,” Trump fired back. “We have plenty of talented people here,” Ingraham countered. “No, you don’t… You don’t have certain talents. And people have to learn. You can’t take people off an unemployment line and say, ‘I’m going to put you into a factory, we’re going to make missiles.’ It’s not an easy thing. Very dangerous, a lot of explosions, a lot of problems.”Trump also doubled down with a real-world example: a September 2025 ICE raid on a Hyundai EV battery plant in Georgia, where more than 400 South Koreans, many with H-1B visas, were briefly detained after complaints by a local MAGA activist.“They had like 500 or 600 people… to make batteries and to teach people how to do it,... they (MAGA) wanted them out of the country. You’re going to need that, Laura. I know you and I disagree on this. ”Trump also defended the inflow of foreign students opposed by MAGA hardliners, calling it essential to prop up U.S. universities. “You don’t want to cut half the people, half the students from all over the world, destroy our university and college system,” he said, referring to plans to admit up to 600,000 Chinese students annually on F-1 visas, which MAGA hardliners say is a gateway for intellectual property theft.The exchange instantly became the rallying cry for a furious backlash that lit up X, formerly Twitter, owned by one-time pro-H1B MAGA supporter Elon Musk – with hashtags like #MAGARevolt and #TalentGate.“This is Davos in a red tie! Telling American engineers and factory workers we lack talent? Then flooding campuses with CCP-linked students? It’s a gut-punch to every voter who bled for this movement. Wake up, Mr. President—this isn’t MAGA, it’s Chamber of Commerce betrayal,” raged former Trump aide Steve Bannon on his War Room podcast.MAGA gadabout Laura Loomer, a pro-Trump firebrand, said the President had to fix the problem or face the fire. “‘No, you don’t have talent. That’s what Trump just told 74 million Americans. H-1Bs over STEM grads, 600K Chinese visas while tuition bankrupts families—this is globalism with a red hat,” she said. And from MAGA influencer Jack Posobiec: “Insult of the year: Trump says Americans can’t build missiles without foreign babysitters. H-1B + Chinese student surge = Trojan horse for Beijing. America First means Americans first. Period.”White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt downplayed the uproar, telling reporters: ""The president is threading the needle – protecting borders while supercharging American innovation. MAGA knows results over rhetoric.""But surveys show Trump’s MAGA base is getting increasingly disenchanted with his gilded era where billionaires and foreign leaders strut through the Oval Office while they continue to get slammed economically. The perception that foreign students and guest workers are damaging to the U.S-born is now so strong that Nalin Haley, son of the Indian-American former governor of South Carolina Nikki Haley, daughter of Sikh immigrants who is not exactly pro-MAGA, is advocating a ban on H1B visas and even legal immigration, framing them as a direct threat to American youth employment and cultural assimilation.""Every friend from my high school group has a college degree from great schools, but none of them have jobs even after searching for more than a year... So when you see a bunch of foreigners coming over here to take jobs that they wanted, they have every right to be pissed, and I'm pissed for them,” he said in a recent interview, igniting a firestorm in immigrant circles about betraying his immigrant heritage.","'You Don't Have Talent in US': Donald Trump’s Shocking Shift on H-1B Visa Policy Debate.

TTP Owns Up to Islamabad Attack, Pak PM Points Finger at India & Afghanistan

Talks collapse amid growing hostilities

Economic and political fallout





Afghanistan’s Taliban government on Wednesday said that it is seeking alternative trade routes through Central Asia as border closures with Pakistan continue to cripple commerce and worsen economic losses.Acting commerce minister Nooruddin Azizi said that the country is losing nearly $200 million every month due to the shutdown of key crossings with Pakistan, accusing Islamabad of “politically motivated” restrictions.“Pakistan has frequently created obstacles, especially during the fruit export season,” Azizi said during a session in Kabul. “These closures are without any foundational or logical basis, and they are damaging to both countries.”At least five major crossings, including Torkham and Spin Boldak, have been closed for more than a month following a sharp deterioration in relations.The closures have disrupted trade, halted exports and caused significant losses for Afghan businesses that rely heavily on overland access to Pakistani ports, according to Afghanistan news channel Amu TV.Calling the Pakistan route “high-risk,” Azizi said Afghan traders have repeatedly suffered losses due to arbitrary decisions by Pakistani authorities.He urged merchants to strengthen economic ties with Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan instead.“We are actively working with northern neighbors to find reliable trade alternatives,” he said. Azizi added that the Taliban government would only trade with Pakistan on the basis of “mutual respect and equality.”“There will be no trade under duress. We are under no obligation,” he said.Azizi also accused Pakistan of exploiting Afghan traders and using commerce as political leverage.“Our traders should not be tools in Pakistan’s hands,” he said. “If Pakistani traders want access to Afghan markets, they must handle marketing and outreach themselves. We will not allow one-sided conditions.”The minister’s remarks came days after Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif declared that dialogue between Islamabad and Kabul had collapsed. He said that the negotiations had “entered an indefinite phase” after two rounds of talks in Istanbul failed to reach an agreement.The collapse in talks follows weeks of cross-border clashes that have killed civilians and soldiers on both sides, marking the most serious escalation in years. The violence began after explosions in Kabul and Paktika on October 9, which the Afghan government blamed on Pakistan.Pakistan has neither confirmed nor denied involvement, but its military later said it had carried out retaliatory strikes targeting militant hideouts and army posts across the border.Military spokesman Lt Gen Ahmad Sharif said more than 200 Afghan soldiers and 100 militants were killed in the strikes, while Afghan officials claimed only nine soldiers had died and accused Pakistan of killing civilians.Afghan spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid said 45 civilians were killed and over 100 wounded, while claiming 58 Pakistani soldiers had died, figures Islamabad disputes, saying 23 soldiers were killed.The clashes has coincided with rising economic strain inside Afghanistan. With border routes blocked, exports have fallen sharply, inflation has increased and traders face growing uncertainty.Pakistan remains one of Afghanistan’s largest trading partners, with annual trade worth over $1.5 billion before the latest closures. But with relations deteriorating, Afghan authorities are now encouraging exporters to redirect goods through northern corridors linked to Central Asia.“Our traders should not be tools in Pakistan’s hands. If Pakistani traders want access to Afghan markets, they must handle marketing and outreach themselves. We will not allow one-sided conditions,” Azizi said.The two countries share a 2,611-kilometre frontier, known as the Durand Line, drawn during British rule in 1893.Afghanistan has never formally recognised it as an international border, a long-standing source of friction that continues to fuel political and security disputes.Despite mediation efforts by Qatar and Turkey, both sides remain entrenched, with no sign of an immediate resolution. Analysts warn that if the border deadlock persists, it could deepen Afghanistan’s economic crisis and further isolate the landlocked nation.","Afghanistan is losing nearly $200 million every month due to the shutdown of key crossings with Pakistan.

Supply chain shift: GM tells suppliers to exit China by 2027; move signals deeper US-China trade decoupling,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/supply-chain-shift-gm-tells-suppliers-to-exit-china-by-2027-move-signals-deeper-us-china-trade-decoupling/articleshow/125274256.cms,"'India Won’t Be A Dumping Ground': Piyush Goyal Blasts China For Unfair And Unethical Trade Practice

Automakers brace for tariff shocks and rare-earth curbs

A complex and costly transition for suppliers





General Motors (GM) has asked thousands of its suppliers to eliminate parts sourced from China by 2027, in one of the auto industry’s most aggressive moves yet to insulate its operations from deepening US-China trade tensions, Reuters reported, citing four people familiar with the matter.According to the report, GM has directed suppliers to find alternative sources for raw materials and components, with the eventual goal of moving its entire supply chain out of China. The automaker first approached some suppliers with this directive in late 2024, but the push gained momentum earlier this year amid an escalating trade conflict between Washington and Beijing.GM executives told suppliers the move is part of a broader strategy to enhance “supply chain resiliency,” Reuters said. The company’s leadership has repeatedly cited the need to mitigate risks arising from geopolitical disruptions, such as rare-earth bottlenecks and computer-chip shortages that have plagued global automakers since 2021.The directive covers parts and materials used in vehicles manufactured in North America — GM’s biggest production hub — and extends to countries like Russia and Venezuela, which face similar US trade restrictions.However, China remains the largest source of affected components, Reuters reported.The automaker, which has already diversified its sourcing of electric vehicle materials by investing in a US lithium mine and partnering with a domestic rare-earth company, is now broadening its efforts to include basic parts and industrial inputs.GM declined to comment on its supplier discussions. However, CEO Mary Barra told investors during an October earnings call, “We’ve been working now for a few years to have supply chain resiliency… sourcing parts in the same country where we build the cars, whenever possible.”Shilpan Amin, GM’s global purchasing chief, reiterated at a recent industry event that the company can no longer rely solely on the lowest-cost countries. “Resiliency is important — making sure you have more control over your supply chain and you know exactly what is coming from where,” Amin said, according to Reuters.The decision comes despite recent signs of easing trade tensions. Following an October meeting between US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping, both nations agreed to roll back select tariffs and export restrictions. But automakers remain wary, Reuters noted, as the sector continues to face fallout from unpredictable trade dynamics.Earlier this year, China restricted exports of rare-earth materials crucial for car electronics, sending automakers scrambling to stockpile supplies. The situation worsened in October when Beijing expanded those restrictions, triggering warnings of widespread factory disruptions.Adding to the strain, a separate dispute between Chinese and Dutch authorities led China to halt shipments from Nexperia, a major supplier of low-cost automotive chips, further fuelling concerns about the fragility of global production networks.Industry executives told Reuters that reconfiguring supply chains away from China will take years and entail significant costs. China’s dominance in key manufacturing areas -- from automotive lighting to tooling and die-making — makes it difficult for suppliers to quickly pivot.“It’s a big effort. Suppliers are scrambling,” one senior executive at a major auto parts manufacturer told Reuters.Collin Shaw, president of MEMA, the Vehicle Suppliers Association, said carmakers and their partners have been working to “de-risk” supply chains, but decades of dependence on Chinese manufacturing won’t be easy to undo.“In some cases, this has been 20 or 30 years in the making, and we’re trying to undo it in a few years,” Shaw told Reuters. “It’s not going to happen that fast.”GM’s move, analysts say, reflects a broader industry trend --an attempt to balance economic realities with national security imperatives as the world’s two largest economies continue to reshape global trade rules.","General Motors (GM) has asked thousands of its suppliers to eliminate parts sourced from China by 2027.

The longest federal government shutdown in US history has upended airlines’ holiday quarter expectations, grounding thousands of flights and forcing carriers to scramble for contingency plans as operations across the country remain crippled.Airlines, which had been counting on a rebound in corporate and leisure travel, are now seeing Thanksgiving bookings grow by just 1% since late October — roughly half the expected pace, according to aviation analytics firm Cirium, Reuters reported. The slump underscores travellers’ hesitation amid the prolonged shutdown.The Senate on Monday approved a bill to restore federal funding, raising hopes that the shutdown could end within the week. However, industry executives warned disruptions would likely persist. According to FlightAware data, over 8,000 flights were cancelled in the past four days — nearly double the cancellations seen in the entire first month of the shutdown. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has since ordered progressive flight cuts at 40 major airports.Widespread cancellations have left pilots and crew reaching their federally mandated duty limits before completing routes, forcing airlines to reshuffle schedules.Delta and United have offered premium pay to incentivise pilots and flight attendants to take additional trips, while other carriers are relying heavily on reserve crews, Reuters reported.JetBlue’s senior vice president of system operations and airports, Steve Olson, told Reuters, “What we do today matters because it's going to influence how the rest of the month is going to pan out.”The broader industry impact is significant. Airline Reporting Corp. data showed that US air ticket sales through November fell 10% year-on-year, while major carriers such as American Airlines and Delta estimated daily revenue losses nearing $1 million during the shutdown’s early weeks. Analysts now expect those losses to surge.Daniel McKenzie of Seaport Research Partners said the 10% FAA-mandated cuts could cost airlines about $10 million a day, potentially ballooning to $45 million daily if restrictions extend through Thanksgiving.Budget carriers such as Frontier and Allegiant face steeper risks due to their limited flight frequencies, while larger airlines like American, Delta, and United could absorb some diverted traffic, McKenzie noted.While the FAA aims to restore full operations once government funding resumes, the exact recovery timeline remains uncertain — leaving airlines and passengers alike bracing for turbulence well into the holiday season.","Airlines had been counting on a rebound in corporate and leisure travel.

Is US President Donald Trump softening his stance on an aggressive push for H-1B visa reforms? The Republican leader, in a recent interview, appeared to do so as he recognised the need to import foreign talent to America.In a conversation with Fox News host Laura Ingraham on Tuesday (local time), he defended the value of skilled immigrant workers. He asserted that US cannot repurpose long-term unemployed Americans for complex roles like manufacturing and defence without training.Trump added that he supports raising wages for American workers, but the US must still ""bring this talent"" to maintain its industrial and technological edge.When asked whether H-1B visa reform is a major priority for the US government, Trump responded, ""I agree, but you also have to bring this talent.""Ingraham countered him, saying that US has ""plenty of talented people.""Trump in response said, ""No, you don't. There are certain skills you don't have, and people have to learn them. You can't take people off the unemployment line and say, 'I'm going to put you into a factory where we're going to make missiles.'""He then cited US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials' raid on under-construction Hyundai plant in Georgia as an example, explaining that the removal of skilled foreign workers created difficulties in manufacturing complex products.""They had people from South Korea that had made batteries all their life. Making batteries is very complicated and very dangerous -- a lot of explosions, a lot of problems. They had like 500 or 600 people in the early stages to make batteries and to teach people how to do it,"" he said.During the ICE raid on the facility, hundreds of South Korean workers were arrested and deported.The US president further said that several industries need specialised expertise and that cannot be filled by untrained or long-term unemployed workers.""You can't just say a country is coming in, going to invest USD 10 billion to build a plant, and take people off the unemployment line who haven't worked in five years, and they're going to start making missiles.

Asian equities edged higher on Wednesday following signs that the US government shutdown could end soon and amid data pointing to a cooling jobs market, which has raised expectations of a Federal Reserve interest rate cut.Markets, however, remain cautious on technology stocks after a year of strong AI-driven gains.In early Asian trade, major indices rose, with Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 up 0.2% at 50,927, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng climbing 1.1% to 26,984, and Shanghai’s Composite adding 0.3% to 4,015, as per news agency AFP.Despite the overall positive trend, technology stocks faced pressure after Japanese investor SoftBank sold its entire stake in US chipmaker Nvidia for $5.8 billion, leading to a 3% drop in Nvidia shares and a 10% fall in SoftBank’s Tokyo listing.After the Senate approved a temporary spending bill, the US House of Representatives is set to vote, with President Donald Trump expected to sign the legislation, potentially reopening government services as early as Friday.The shutdown, which began on October 1, left a million federal workers unpaid and delayed key economic data, complicating the Fed’s policy decisions.Private payroll data from ADP showed US companies shed an average of 11,250 jobs per week in the four weeks ending October 25, highlighting weakness in the labour market and increasing bets on a Fed rate cut in December, reported Bloomberg.Outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas also reported that October saw the highest level of layoffs in 22 years.Oil prices were largely steady, following gains in the previous session, as traders weighed potential demand increases from a reopening of the US government.Brent crude slipped 8 cents to $65.08 a barrel, while US West Texas Intermediate fell 7 cents to $60.97, reported Reuters.Analysts noted that restoring government operations could boost consumer confidence, travel, and jet fuel demand ahead of the holiday season.On the supply side, US sanctions on Russian oil producers, including Lukoil and Rosneft, continue to influence global markets, prompting some Chinese refiners to seek non-Russian crude and schedule maintenance disruptions, according to Reuters.Currency and bond markets reflected cautious optimism. The euro dipped to $1.1579, the pound fell to $1.3143, and the dollar strengthened against the yen to 154.37, while US 10-year Treasury yields fell to 4.08% on expectations of looser monetary policy, as per Bloomberg.Asian investors are now monitoring the House vote in Washington closely, with a potential government reopening seen as a key catalyst for equities and crude demand in the near term.","Tokyo's Nikkei 225 up 0.2% at 50,927, Hong Kong's Hang Seng climbs 1.1% to 26,984, and Shanghai's Composite adds 0.3% to 4,015.

"US govt shutdown nears end: Airlines cancel 1,200 flights; FAA, carriers discuss gradual rollback",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-govt-shutdown-nears-end-airlines-cancel-1200-flights-faa-carriers-discuss-gradual-rollback/articleshow/125263751.cms,"1000+ Flights Cancelled As Shutdown Severely Impacts American Aviation Sector





Airlines in the United States cancelled nearly 1,200 flights on Tuesday (local time), showing signs of recovery as air traffic control staffing improved markedly ahead of an anticipated resolution to the record 42-day government shutdown expected as soon as Wednesday.According to Reuters, the cancellations followed a chaotic Monday when 2,400 flights were cancelled and 9,600 delayed nationwide. By Tuesday, delays had dropped to 1,700 — the best operational performance the industry has recorded in recent days.Last week, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) had instructed airlines to reduce their daily flight schedules by 4% at 40 major airports starting November 7 due to staffing shortages among air traffic controllers. The reductions climbed to 6% on Tuesday and were projected to reach 8% on Thursday and 10% on Friday, November 14. Discussions between airlines and the FAA are underway on how and when these cuts can be reduced or lifted as the shutdown edges toward conclusion.President Donald Trump on Monday warned that air traffic controllers who refused to return to work could face pay cuts, adding that he would welcome resignations from those not fulfilling their duties.Some carriers have begun holding off on deeper reductions. United Airlines said on Tuesday that it has cut about 5% of its scheduled flights for Thursday, short of the planned 8%.Sources told Reuters that several options are being explored by the FAA to phase out the reductions. Air traffic staffing levels improved sharply on Tuesday, with only four issues reported compared to 81 on Saturday, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said.At a press briefing at Chicago O’Hare International Airport, Duffy stated that adjustments would be made gradually as safety allows. “When that data changes, we're going to start taking that down from 6%, maybe we’ll go to four, two, and get back to normal air travel,” Duffy said. “It depends on controllers coming back to work.”Meanwhile, the Senate voted late Monday to pass legislation funding the government through January 30. The House is expected to consider the bill on Wednesday. Duffy warned that if the House fails to pass the measure, flight disruptions could worsen this weekend. “That’s how serious this is,” he said, noting that some major airlines might be forced to halt operations.Since the shutdown began on October 1, air traffic absences have led to tens of thousands of cancellations and delays, affecting an estimated 1.2 million passengers over the weekend alone. The ongoing shutdown — the longest in US history — has required 13,000 air traffic controllers and 50,000 Transportation Security Administration (TSA) agents to work without pay.The FAA currently faces a shortfall of about 3,500 air traffic controllers, many of whom were already working six-day weeks and mandatory overtime even before the shutdown began.","Airlines in the United States cancelled nearly 1,200 flights on Tuesday (local time) The cancellations followed a chaotic Monday when 2,400 flights were cancelled and 9,600 delayed nationwide.

Cyber security challenges





The Hague (Netherlands): The industrial automation sector is entering a new age where artificial intelligence (AI) and human expertise converge, said Honeywell Process Solutions CEO Jim Masso.Speaking at the Honeywell Users Group (HUG) 2025 Europe Conference in The Hague on Tuesday where the spotlight has been industrial automation and AI, Masso traced the company’s legacy from the development of the world’s first distributed control system (DCS) five decades ago to the present era of connected digital ecosystems and said: “The original goal of automation, achieving deterministic outcomes, remains unchanged even as AI transforms the landscape. ”Honeywell’s next frontier, Masso noted, lies in digital cognition and closed-loop AI systems capable of “seeing, thinking, acting, and learning.” These technologies, built on the company’s Honeywell Forge platform and its Digital Prime ecosystem, aim to combine deep domain expertise with data-driven intelligence to enhance predictability, safety, and performance in critical operations. “The future of automation is about assets that are more connected, more software-aided, and capable of driving optimal outcomes,” he said.Honeywell’s AI-powered platform , the Experion Cognition system, enables facilities to move toward autonomy while maintaining human oversight.Masso cautioned that cybersecurity challenges are evolving as rapidly as automation itself. He stressed the need for domain-specific security platforms tightly integrated with operational technology (OT) systems to ensure resilience as industrial networks become more connected. “Cybersecurity must advance at the same pace as automation,” he said.While technology headlines often focus on AI and autonomy, Masso emphasized that people remain the most important component of industrial transformation. Drawing from a recent AI roundtable, he noted that projects are 2.5 times more successful when leadership (the CEO) fully supports adoption, but cautioned that the real change happens on the plant floor. “What’s encouraging is that operators themselves are getting excited about new capabilities,” he said, citing a chemical refinery where young operators with just two days of experience were already managing an AI-enabled plant using Honeywell’s Forge-based systems.Marking a major milestone, Masso announced the launch of Honeywell’s Autonomy X, a new initiative designed to accelerate AI adoption and autonomous control systems across industries such as energy, chemicals, mining, and life sciences.(This correspondent is in The Hague at the invitation of Honeywell Process Solutions)","Honeywell CEO Jim Masso spoke at the Honeywell Users Group (HUG) 2025 Europe Conference in The Hague.

Wall Street witnessed mixed trading on Tuesday, cooling off after Monday’s sharp rally that followed a week of losses. The S&P 500 slipped 0.2% in early trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 73 points, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq fell 0.5%.

The longest federal government shutdown in US history may be nearing its end, but economists say it has already left deep scars on an economy struggling with slow growth, inflation, and uncertainty. With 1.25 million federal workers unpaid since October 1 and thousands of flights canceled, the economic fallout is being felt nationwide — from Washington’s suburbs to America’s busiest airports, AP reported.The Senate late Monday night passed a bipartisan funding package to end the 41-day government shutdown, sending it to the Republican-controlled House of Representatives for approval. Speaker Mike Johnson said the House could vote as soon as Wednesday to clear the bill and send it to President Trump for his signature. However, not all Democrats are pleased with the compromise, and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer faces criticism from within his party for conceding without securing a firm deal on Obamacare subsidies.In the meantime, while most lost activity may eventually recover once the government reopens, experts warn that billions in economic output will never be regained. “Short-lived shutdowns are usually invisible in the data, but this one will leave a lasting mark,” said Gregory Daco, Chief Economist at EY, citing the shutdown’s record duration and growing disruptions to travel and welfare services.The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that a six-week shutdown will cut US economic growth in the fourth quarter by 1.5 percentage points, reducing output by half from the previous quarter. Even after reopening, about $11 billion in economic activity will be permanently lost, it said.Missed paychecks and weakened sentiment hit households hardRoughly 650,000 federal employees were furloughed, and all told, unpaid wages could reach $16 billion by mid-November, reducing household spending and holiday travel, according to the CBO. Although back pay is expected, the sudden loss of income has forced families to postpone large purchases and delay rent or mortgage payments.The impact is particularly sharp in the Washington, D.C. region, where the unemployment rate already stood at 6% before the shutdown. Federal workers make up 5.5% of Maryland’s workforce, while other states such as New Mexico (2.9%), Oklahoma (2.6%), and Alaska (3.8%) also face ripple effects.Federal contractors, who number as many as 5.2 million nationwide, are not guaranteed back pay, compounding the financial strain. Economist Bernard Yaros of Oxford Economics said, “The federal award spigot has all but turned off at the Department of Defense, NASA, and Homeland Security,” estimating that $800 million in new government contracts were at risk of not being awarded each day.Consumer sentiment has also soured sharply. The University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment index fell to 50.4 in November, its lowest in three years, as pessimism about personal finances and business conditions deepened.Flight cancellations, SNAP delays, and Fed policy falloutThe shutdown’s most visible impact has been on air travel, with airlines canceling over 7,500 flights since Friday amid air traffic controller shortages. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) ordered carriers to cut flight capacity by up to 10% to ease the burden on unpaid staff, a move that analysts say could cost the travel industry $2.6 billion if the standoff continues through mid-November.Tourism Economics estimated that travel spending is down $63 million per day, affecting hotels, restaurants, and local businesses. “The longer this goes on, the fewer trips will be rescheduled,” the firm said.The shutdown has also delayed $8 billion in monthly SNAP food aid for 42 million Americans, disrupting grocery spending and household budgets. Some states have covered shortfalls temporarily, but the White House and Congress remain at odds over full benefit funding.Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve’s ability to assess the economy has been crippled by missing data on inflation, unemployment, and consumer spending. Chair Jerome Powell likened the situation to “driving in the fog,” signalling that the central bank may hold off on a December rate cut due to data gaps.“What do you do if you're driving in the fog? You slow down,” Powell said. “The lack of data could make it difficult to justify another rate cut at this stage.”Even as Congress edges toward a resolution, economists warn that the shutdown’s lasting damage to public confidence, household budgets, and business investment could weigh on recovery well into next year.","1.25 million federal workers unpaid since October 1 and thousands of flights canceled.

AI shift: SoftBank sells Nvidia stake for $5.8 billion; focuses on OpenAI after tripling first-half profit,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/ai-shift-softbank-sells-nvidia-stake-for-5-8-billion-focuses-on-openai-after-tripling-first-half-profit/articleshow/125249904.cms,"



Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp has sold its stake in US chipmaker Nvidia for $5.8 billion, signalling a strategic pivot toward artificial intelligence investments, particularly in OpenAI , the company said on Tuesday, AP reported. The tech conglomerate also reported that its profit nearly tripled in the first half of the current fiscal year, driven by strong returns from its Vision Funds.The Tokyo-based firm said the Nvidia shares were sold in October as part of Chairman Masayoshi Son’s broader plan to redirect resources toward next-generation AI ventures. SoftBank’s net profit for the April–September period surged to about 2.5 trillion yen (roughly $13 billion), while sales rose 7.7 per cent year-on-year to 3.7 trillion yen ($24 billion).SoftBank’s earnings tend to fluctuate sharply due to its exposure to multiple high-growth and high-risk ventures. However, its tech-heavy portfolio has seen a rebound in 2025 amid the global AI boom.Earlier this year, Son joined US President Donald Trump, OpenAI’s Sam Altman, and Oracle’s Larry Ellison in announcing Project Stargate -- a proposed $500 billion mega-initiative to develop AI infrastructure and computing power.SoftBank has already invested tens of billions of dollars in OpenAI and plans to expand AI services in Japan through the collaboration.The sale of its Nvidia stake marks a deliberate reallocation of capital -- locking in gains from Nvidia’s meteoric rise while freeing funds for direct AI ventures.Nvidia recently became the world’s first $5 trillion company, fuelled by soaring demand for AI chips. The company has also announced a $100 billion investment in OpenAI to build at least 10 gigawatts of new AI data centres to boost computing capacity.While SoftBank no longer holds Nvidia stock, it maintains ties through various portfolio companies that use Nvidia technology in AI and robotics. SoftBank also holds stakes in Arm Holdings and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC), both of which have benefited from the AI-driven surge in chip demand.SoftBank’s stock has nearly doubled over the past year, rising 2 per cent in Tokyo trading on Tuesday.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.","Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor (CEA) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas.

How India's GDP has been growing

What SBI report said on savings and investment

Incremental capital output ratio

NEW DELHI: India's gross domestic product (GDP) data for the third quarter (October-December 2022) received a word of caution from the former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan In an interview with news agency PTI, Rajan that India is ""dangerously close"" to the Hindu rate of growth in view of subdued private sector investment, high interest rates and slowing global growth.India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying"".However, a report released by the State Bank of India (SBI) economists on Tuesday dismissed arguments that India is dangerously close to Hindu rate of growth saying such statements are ""ill-conceived, biased and premature"".The term 'Hindu growth rate' was coined by late economist Raj Krishna in 1978 to describe the slow growth in the country.It basically refers to the low pace of economic growth rates during 1950s to 1980s. During this period, the Indian economy averaged 3.5%.A former lecturer at the Delhi School of Economics (DSE), Krishna noted that only if the rate of growth is persistently slow and accompanied by low per-capita GDP, then it will be known as Hindu rate of growth but it has to factor in population growth as well.Before economic reforms of 1991, India's economic growth remained stagnant and low, while per capita income averaged around 1.3%.Krishna termed this low growth situation to be a result of socialist policies of state control and import substitution.However, the economic situation changed when liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation (LPG) reforms came into effect in the year 1991, at a time when India faced balance of payment crisis.Over the years, many economists have strongly opposed the idea of 'Hindu growth rate' and the term never had universal acceptance.The Indian economy plunged into its very first technical recession in FY21 due to the impact of Covid-19 pandemic and the related nationwide lockdowns. GDP shrunk by an unprecedented 23.8% in the first quarter of the financial year 2020-21. However, due to spurt in economic activities in the subsequent quarters, the GDP decline started to narrow.However, if we look at the period before Covid-19 as well, India's growth curve shows a declining trend.From 8.26% in FY17, GDP growth plunged to 3.74% in FY20. Shutdown of economic activities in FY21 in wake of Covid-19 only made matters worse.As lockdowns started to ease and business activities resumed, India's GDP also started rising. In Q1 of FY22, growth jumped to 20.1% mainly on account of low base effect. By the fourth quarter of FY22, growth came down to 4.10%.Similarly, the new financial year 2022-23 brought fresh economic challenges in the form of Russia-Ukraine war that impacted almost all major economies of the world, slowed the pace of growth, pushed inflation to record highs.As a result, the central banks of all advanced economies spurred into action and opted for monetary policy tightening to curb the soaring inflation.With persistently rising interest rates, India's economy grew by 4.4% in Q3 of FY23, as the Centre revised upwards GDP growth for previous year to 9.10% from 8.7% earlier.The report weighed recent GDP numbers against the available data on savings and investments for the past decade and highlighted some interesting points.""Quarterly growth numbers are noisy and should be best avoided for any serious interpretation (on an average, India's GDP growth has witnessed Rs 2 lakh crore upward revision for the 3 year ended FY23),"" the report said.Gross capital formation (GCF) by the government touched a high of 11.8% in 2021-22, up from 10.7% in 2020-21.""This also had a domino effect on private sector investment that jumped from 10 per cent to 10.8% over the same period,"" it said.In fact, Ecowrap added that the trends in GCF to gross output ratio or the plough back of funds for creation of fresh capacity shows that for public administration the ratio attained fresh peak in 2021-22 owing to the emphasis on capital expenditure in recent budgets.At the aggregate level, gross capital formation is supposed to have crossed 32% in 2022-23, the highest level since 2018-19.According to the report, in 2021-22, gross savings have risen to 30% from 29% in 2020-21.""The ratio is supposed to have crossed 31 per cent in 2022-23, the highest since 2018-19. The household savings increased sharply during the pandemic period on account of sharp accretion in financial savings such as deposits,"" said the report by SBI's Economic Research Department.While household financial savings have since then moderated from 15.4% in 2020-21 to 11.1% in 2022-23, savings in physical assets have grown sharply to 11.8% in 2021-22 from 10.7% in 2020-21.The report further analysed Incremental Capital Output ratio (ICOR) -- which measures additional units of capital (investment) needed to produce additional units of output. It said that the ratio has been improving.""ICOR which was 7.5 in FY 12 is now only 3.5 in FY22. Clearly, only half of capital is now needed for next unit of output,"" the report noted.Such reducing ICOR in the current years reflects a relatively increasing efficiency of capital and shows that the economy is on a sound footing, the report said.""From that point of view, future GDP growth rates even at 7% could still mean a decent number by any standards!,"" it added.","India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter.

An employee is entitled for a 50 per cent amount of the last drawn salary as pension.OPS was discontinued by the NDA government in 2003 with effect from April 1, 2004.Under the new pension scheme (NPS), employees contribute 10 per cent of their basic salary towards pension while the government contributes 14 per cent.Governments of Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand have informed the central government/ Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA about their decision to restart OPS for their employees.The government of Punjab on November 18, 2022, issued a notification regarding implementation of OPS for the state government employees who are being covered under NPS. Jharkhand too has decided to revert to OPS.",Former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan has expressed his concern over the decision of some states to restart the old pension scheme.

1) Effective Date:

2) Structure and Presentation:

3) Tax Year Concept:

4) Introduction of Taxpayer's Charter :

5) Simplified TDS /TCS Sections:

6) Are there any major policy changes or new taxes?



Conclusion



(Gaurav Mehndiratta is Partner and National Head, Corporate and International Tax, KPMG in India and Siddharth Kaul is Partner Corporate and International Tax, KPMG in India)

New Income Tax Bill 2025 : After the third term re-election of the Indian Government, in the Budget speech, the finance minister (FM) announced a comprehensive review of the Income Tax (IT) Act, focusing on four primary pillars: simplification of language, litigation reduction, compliance reduction, and elimination of redundant provisions. This promise was fulfilled when the IT Bill, 2025 (Bill) was presented in the Lok Sabha yesterday to replace the existing law which is more than 6 decades old.The Bill will take effect on April 1, 2026, allowing time for necessary consultations with stakeholders before its enactment which is a welcome move. The bill will first go to the Parliament’s Standing Committee on Finance for detailed examination before being enacted following the parliamentary approval process.The Bill's total word count is approximately 55% of that of the existing law. This reduction was achieved by eliminating obsolete sections, such as those related to the dividend distribution tax, fringe benefit tax, lapsed tax holidays, etc. Additionally, lengthy sentences have been broken down into clauses, tables to improve readability. Furthermore, provisions previously scattered across the existing law, such as those related to non-profit organizations, start-ups, etc are sought to be grouped more logically.Also Read | New Income Tax Bill 2025 explained: 10 key takeaways for taxpayers - top points you should know The concept of an ""assessment year"" has been removed, with the term ""previous year"" now referred to as ""tax year."" This is intended to align with commonly used terminology in tax legislation in other countries.The Bill includes a taxpayer's charter to ensure transparency and fairness in tax administration. It is expected that CBDT will issue guidelines from time to time to the field formations for administration of the charter.The Bill merges all TDS/TCS related provisions in one place and provides simplified tables for category wise rates, thresholds etc. as against current complex and lengthy provisions.Recent beneficial changes introduced in budgets, such as streamlining TDS/TCS provisions, reducing income tax slab rates under the new regime, introducing three-year block assessment for transfer pricing matters, and providing additional timelines for filing updated returns, etc have all been included in the bill. Additionally, there are no changes in the tax rates. Further no new taxes are introduced or reinstated like equalization levy for non-resident e-commerce operators, etc.However, some wording changes provided in the Bill require detailed evaluation such as new methodology for interpretation of undefined terms in the treaties, interpretation of the term ‘information’ for reassessment of past years, certain simplified definitions, etc.Also Read | New Income Tax Bill 2025: Read full text of proposed new I-T Act Although India's diverse economy rarely has a one-size-fits-all solution, the government's efforts to simplify the tax system and improve the ease of doing business are commendable. While no substantial amendments have been proposed, the overall simplification should benefit taxpayers in terms of ease of compliance and certainty of positions and to that extent, it should not be seen as a zero-sum game.However, a lot depends on administration once it becomes law. Detailed rules will be required for the smooth operation of the new law and additionally, it will be interesting to see how current judicial precedents, guidance, circulars and notifications, will apply in interpretation of the new law.","The Bill will take effect on April 1, 2026, allowing time for necessary consultations with stakeholders before its enactment. The Bill's total word count is approximately 55% of that of the existing law. No new taxes are introduced or reinstated like equalization levy for non-resident e-commerce operators, etc.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118245228,imgsize-71434,width-400,resizemode-4/118245228.jpg"

When will your loan EMIs come down?

Loan EMI calculator after RBI MPC meet: Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Sanjay Malhotra on Friday announced the Monetary Policy Committee’s unanimous decision to cut the key repo rate by 25 basis points. Repo rate is the rate at which banks are able to borrow money from the RBI.A repo rate cut is always good news for home loan borrowers, since EMIs come down. But this time around, it’s a double bonanza for the middle class! With FM Nirmala Sitharaman having announced NIL income tax up to Rs 12 lakh income levels in Budget 2025, the relief in loan EMIs is the cherry on the cake.Experts say that come April 1, 2025, middle class and common man will enjoy the twin benefits of changes in income tax slabs and rates and lower EMIs.So how much will you save on EMIs? What does the income tax relief + lower EMIs combination mean for middle class monthly savings? And, importantly, when will your loan EMIs start coming down? We take a look:According to loan EMI calculations provided by BASIC Home Loan, an individual with a home loan amount of Rs 50 lakh and paying a current interest rate of 8.75% for a 30 year loan will see a reduction of around Rs 889/- per month in the EMI. The EMI amount will go down from Rs 39,335/- to Rs 38,446/-Also Read | Income Tax Slabs FY 2025-26 explained: 20 FAQs individual taxpayers should check to understand tax rates, income tax benefit under new tax regime The biggest takeaway for the middle class is the combined bonanza from income tax slab and rate changes under the new income tax regime and the prospect of lower EMIs in the coming months. In an analysis BankBazaar explains this better:“A salaried person with a gross income of Rs 25 lakh and a home loan of Rs 50 lakh (20 years, 9%, 12 EMIs paid by March), can hope to save a total of Rs 1.37 lakh in FY 2025-26. This will be through a combination of interest savings on the home loan rate reduction of 25 basis points and the tax savings from higher tax slabs from April 1,” says Adhil Shetty, CEO of BankBazaar.The analysis suggests that an individual under the new income tax regime with a gross salary of Rs 25 lakh will now possibly save up to Rs 11,461/- per month with the changes in income tax slabs, rates and the reduced interest rate on loan. This benefit could go up to Rs 13.389/- per month for an individual earning a gross salary of Rs 50 lakh.According to Vivek Iyer, Partner and Financial Services Risk Leader at Grant Thornton Bharat, the repo rate cut transmission will take about 3 to 4 months. “It may not be transmitted in full as banks would need to transmit it only to borrowers whose credit standing is good and hence on an overall portfolio basis it may vary from bank to bank,” Iyer told TOI.Also Read | Budget 2025 Income Tax calculator explained: Save up to Rs 1.1 lakh! How income tax slab changes will benefit taxpayers at different salary levels under new regime Atul Monga, Co-Founder and CEO, BASIC Home Loan also says that it will take some time for the repo rate cut relief to trickle down to loan borrowers.“The MPC’s decision to reduce the policy rate by 25 basis points to 6.25% is a strategic move to fuel economic growth by making borrowing more affordable. Both existing and new borrowers under floating rate loans stand to benefit from lower interest rates, improving loan affordability and accessibility. Fixed rate loan borrowers will remain unaffected from the rate cut,” Monga told TOI.“That said, banks and housing finance companies may take some time to fully transmit the benefits of this rate cut to borrowers, depending on their policies and rate cycle. Lenders have to reset their external benchmark lending rates at least once in 3 months. Borrowers will see benefits once the lenders resets their benchmark rates, which can vary depending on the lender and customer profile,” he explains.Also Read | Latest income tax slabs 2025-26: How much tax do individuals earning slightly above Rs 12 lakh have to pay? Marginal relief calculations explained","For a Rs 1 crore loan at current interest rate of 8.75%, the EMI will come down from Rs 84,450 to Rs 82,630. For a Rs 50 lakh loan at a 9.55% interest rate, the E MI will come out to Rs 41,315. The cut will take effect from April 1.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118010397,imgsize-101606,width-400,resizemode-4/118010397.jpg"

Stock market recommendations: According to Bajaj Broking Research, Vedanta and International Gemmological Institute are the top stock picks for today. Here’s its view on Nifty, Bank Nifty and the top stock picks for February 14, 2025:The Index on Thursday’s session traded with high volatility and closed marginally lower. In the process extended decline for the seventh session in a row. In the daily chart it has formed a second consecutive doji candle highlighting indecision and higher volatility. On Wednesday, it has formed a long-legged doji candle, indicating that support is emerging from the previous major low.Going ahead, we expect the index to enter a base formation within the 23,600-22,800 range. A breakdown below the support level of 22,800 could trigger a further decline towards the 22,500-22,600 levels.We believe Nifty after 13% correction in the last five months is approaching both pricewise and time-wise maturity. Hence the current decline should be used to accumulate quality stocks backed by strong earnings from medium to long term prospective.Bouts of volatility cannot be dismissed due to concerns surrounding US tariff-related developments. Additionally, Prime Minister Modi's visit to the US will be an important event to watch.On the global macro front, amid concerns over tariffs, the US Dollar Index attempted but failed to break above the 110 mark and is currently trading near 107.5. Meanwhile, Brent crude has posted losses for the third straight week, trading around $75. A declining US Dollar Index and falling Brent crude prices are favorable for risk-on sentiment in emerging markets.Bank Nifty has relatively outperformed during the recent decline as it rebounded on Wednesday from the 61.8% retracement of the preceding up move 47844-50641.Going ahead, we expect the index to extend the last five weeks consolidation in the broad range of 50,500-48,000.The Bank Nifty in the last 5 weeks has been forming base around the lower band of 2 years rising channel indicating base formation. Thus, making us believe, that the index will continue to resolve higher and move towards the mark of 51600 in the short term being 61.8% retracement of previous fall (53888 -47844). In the process, 48700-38300 shall provide immediate support.Volatility is expected to remain at an elevated levels due to concerns surrounding US tariff-related developments.The stock is witnessing buying demand after forming base at the key support area of 410-400 thus offers fresh entry opportunity with a favorable risk-reward set up. The key support of 410-400 is the confluence of the 52 weeks EMA and the previous multiple lows of the last 7 months as can be seen in the chart.Among the oscillators, the weekly stochastic is in positive trend and has recently generated a buy signal thus validating positive bias. We expect the stock to head higher towards 473 in the coming weeks being 61.8% retracement of previous major decline (526-410).The share price is rebounding after taking support at the falling trendline joining the lows of 27th December and 27th January thus offers fresh entry opportunity with favorable risk reward set up.The stock on Thursday session has generated a breakout above a falling channel of last 7 sessions signaling reversal of corrective trend. We expect the stock to head higher towards 525 levels in the coming weeks being the 80% retracement of the previous decline (542-439).",Bajaj Broking Research says Vedanta and International Gemmological Institute are the top stock picks for today. The index on Thursday’s session traded with high volatility and closed marginally lower. We believe Nifty after 13% correction in the last five months is approaching both pricewise and time-wise maturity.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118219053,imgsize-204026,width-400,resizemode-4/118219053.jpg"

MUMBAI: State Bank of India (SBI) has reduced interest rates on several new retail and business loans linked to external benchmarks, following the RBI's recent repo rate cut.Home loans tied to the External Benchmark Rate (EBR), now at 8.9% (RBI repo rate of 6.25% plus a 2.65% spread), are available at 8.25% to 9.2% depending on the borrowers credit score. The home loan maxgain (overdraft) option ranges from 8.45% to 9.4%. Top-up loans are priced between 8.55% and 11.05%, while top-up (overdraft) loans range from 8.75% to 9.7%.

Rates vary based on the borrower's Cibil score.According to bankers, business loans are linked to the marginal cost of funds and will decline only when deposit rates fall. Last week, HDFC Bank hiked its MCLR despite the RBI rate cut.SBI's auto loans are also linked to the one-year marginal cost of funds-based lending rate (MCLR), currently at 9%, and are likely to decrease only when deposit costs decline. Standard car loans, including the SBI car loan, NRI car loan, and assured car loan scheme, range from 9.2% to 10.15%.Under the loyalty car loan scheme, rates are slightly lower at 9.15% to 10.1%, depending on the borrower's credit profile.The SBI green car loan is available at 9.1% to 10.15% for electric vehicles. Two-wheeler loans are priced between 13.35% and 14.85%, with a 0.5% concession for electric vehicles.

Central banks across Asia are increasingly using derivatives to protect their currencies against a strong dollar, raising questions over how long they can do so and whether they are just storing up trouble for the future. The RBI's net dollar short forward position - the amount of dollars that will be sold at a future date for a pre-set price - hit an all-time high of $68 billion in Dec. Meanwhile Bank Indonesia's net short book reached $19.6 billion, its highest since at least 2015, show the latest official data. The swelling forward books point to a shift in strategy among central banks intervening to defend their currencies. But the use of derivatives in addition to spot trades to push back against the dollar is raising concerns about the risk that selling pressure is being deferred rather than removed.","RBI's net dollar short forward position hit an all-time high of $68 billion in Dec.

NEW DELHI: Amid Donald Trump's moves to redefine global trade rules, the resumption of negotiations for India's free trade deals with the UK and the European Union later this month are seen as indications that India as well as its two trading partners are willing to moving ahead with the much-delayed agreements in a bid to overcome the impact of protectionist American policies.Almost a year after negotiations had come to a halt, British minister of state for trade policy Douglas Alexander is scheduled to be in the Capital next week to restart the dialogue after elections in both countries.Towards the month-end, a team from EU will arrive, following signs of a broad agreement on the direction of talks after commerce secretary Sunil Barthwal and commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal held separate talks with their counterparts in Brussels, clearly articulating the need to recognise India's development status and sensitivities. Besides, India wants EU to budget for non-tariff barriers and not just focus the talks on duty cuts.The conclusion of the two deals can help India increase trade with these two crucial trade partners, although the talks with the EU are unlikely to be finalised in a jiffy, given the large membership of the trading bloc as well as the difficult ask in several areas.The eagerness to move is visible on the Indian side too, which has dropped its resistance in some of the crucial areas. For instance, in the Budget, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman agreed to revisit the model bilateral investment treaty , a major demand from the UK and EU.Similarly, by cutting the levy on bourbon whiskey and some varieties of wine as well as bikes over the last fortnight, govt has signalled its willingness to other trade partners that it can lower duties in case it gets something in return. The latest duty cut on bourbon has also resulted in demands from the local industry to ensure that doors also open for Indian goods in overseas markets.""Govt needs to safeguard the interests of Indian liquor manufacturers while deciding on issues related to customs duty cuts (basic customs duty and agriculture cess) and other concessions under FTAs. Though we have already recommended to govt to cut basic customs duty on spirits over a period of 10 years, we also want govt to ensure better international market access, especially the western countries, and safeguard interests of Indian companies against any dumping of products,"" said Anant S Iyer, director general of the Confederation of Indian Alcoholic Beverage Companies, which represents domestic manufacturers.","The resumption of negotiations for India's free trade deals with the UK and the European Union later this month are seen as indications that India is willing to move ahead.

MUMBAI: Market players are keeping their fingers crossed as investors are weighed down by the continuing bearish sentiment due to a combination of domestic and global factors. Continuous foreign fund selling , weakness of the rupee, the escalating tariff war that was started by the US and a not-so-good quarterly corporate results have pulled the sensex and nifty down by around 2.5% each last week. Investors do not see any positive trigger that could stop the slide.""These declines stem from concerns over US tariff policies and slowing corporate earnings, leading to widespread sell-offs, particularly in small-cap stocks,"" said Krishna Appala, senior research analyst, Capitalmind Research in a note.On Friday, while the sensex ended at 75,939 points, the nifty ended at 22,929 points. Foreign funds have been the largest sellers in the Indian market so far this year with the net outflow already over Rs 1 lakh crore, data from NSDL and BSE showed.Of the total in Feb so far, the net outflow is nearly Rs 21,300 crore. Next week's trading trend, like in the past few weeks, is expected to be determined by trading pattern by foreign fund managers, market players said.The ongoing tariff war that was started by US President Donald Trump after assuming office on Jan 21, is yet to take a definite shape. So the related uncertainties are weighing heavily on markets around the world. Till there is some stability or certainty relating to US's trade relations with its other major trading partners, investors will remain cautious and prefer to avoid 'risk on' trades, market players said.Technically too the indices are at weak positions, chartists said. ""From a technical standpoint, any decisive breakdown below the 22,800-22,700 points zone (lower band for Nifty) could trigger fresh room for 22,500-22,400 in the near period, potentially a decline of nearly 15% from the all-time high,"" said Osho Krishnan, senior analyst, technical & derivatives of Angel One.""On the flip side, a series of resistances could be seen, starting from 23,300-23,350, followed by 23,500 points. Only a breach of these levels could provide some relief for the market participants.""","Foreign funds have been the largest sellers in the Indian market so far this year.

Calls for differential deposit cover intensify,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/calls-for-differential-deposit-cover-intensify/articleshow/118309378.cms,"RBI

MUMBAI: India's deposit insurance fund, close to Rs 2 lakh crore, is the third-largest globally. However, it covers only 46.3% of bank deposits due to the Rs 5 lakh cap on insurance coverage, putting it on the 8th position in terms of coverage.According to bankers, the scheme is adequate as most deposits are with public sector banks or systemically-important banks that are unlikely to fail. A significant portion of the insured deposits are with cooperative banks, where over 90% of customers are fully covered in terms of the number of accounts held.Last week's moratorium on the New India Cooperative Bank by the Reserve Bank of India has once again ignited the debate on the adequate level of deposit insurance cover for bank deposits. Senior citizens are demanding a hike in the coverage reasoning that a chunk of their life savings are at stake.There has been a call for providing a differential level of deposit insurance. In Aug 2024, RBI deputy governor M Rajeshwar Rao had called for periodic revision of premia of deposit-taking institutions with full coverage for certain segments like small deposits and senior citizens.""We could also examine the possible economic viability of an alternate targeted insurance approach with full coverage for certain sections of the customers like small depositors, senior citizens etc. or pools deposits of smaller depositors based on a careful evaluation of the constructs, costs and benefit of such an approach,"" said Rao at a DICGC event in Jaipur.The deposit insurance ceiling started at Rs 1,500 in 1962 and was gradually increased to Rs 30,000 in 1980. It remained at that level until 1993, when it was raised to Rs 1 lakh. For 27 years, it was not revised until 2020, when it was hiked five times to Rs 5 lakh after issues at several private banks, including Yes Bank, triggered deposit withdrawals.In terms of value, payments bank accounts have nearly 100% insurance coverage due to the Rs 2 lakh cap on deposits. Rural banks have 80.3% coverage, cooperative banks 63.2%, public sector banks 48.9%, private sector banks 32.7%, and foreign banks 5%.Globally, the insured deposit ratio varies significantly, from a minimum of 21.5% in Turkey to a maximum of 71% in Belgium. On average, deposit insurers cover around 41% of eligible deposits worldwide, leaving 59% uninsured as of 2022.In India, the uninsured deposits to assessable deposits ratio (UIDR) remained below 80% up to Mar 31, 2024. This aligns with the ""80/20"" rule, which suggests that the insured deposits ratio should be above 20% or the UIDR should be below 80%.The UIDR was below 50% for nearly four decades from 1969 to 2009. As of Mar 31, 2024, it stood at 56.9%, comparable to the global median, according to the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation's (DICGC) annual report.","India's deposit insurance fund, close to Rs 2 lakh crore, is the third-largest globally.

NEW DELHI: A Mumbai court ordered Hitesh Mehta, the former general manager and head of accounts at New India Cooperative Bank, into police custody over the alleged Rs 122 crore misappropriation case.The holiday court on Sunday remanded Mehta and his co-accused, Dharmesh Paun, in custody until February 21 as the economic offences wing (EOW) continues investigation.The case came to light after Devarshi Ghosh, the bank’s acting CEO, filed a complaint at Dadar police station on 14 February, alleging that Mehta and his associates conspired to deviate off funds from the bank’s Prabhadevi and Goregaon branches. Following this, the FIR was registered in the early hours of Saturday, and given the scale of the scam, it was later handed over to the EOW.Authorities have charged the accused under sections 316 (5) and 61(2) of the Bharatiya Nyay Sanhita (BNS). Initial findings suggested that the fraudulent transactions took place over a five-year period between 2020 and 2025. The discrepancies in the bank’s accounts were first indicated during an internal audit, leading to the police complaint.The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) intervened, taking over the bank’s board for a year and appointing an administrator, Shreekant (former chief general manager at the State Bank of India), to oversee its affairs.A ‘committee of advisors,’ comprising former SBI General Manager Ravindra Sapra and Chartered Accountant Abhijeet Deshmukh, has also been formed to assist.The RBI's move follows its decision to impose restrictions on withdrawals, citing “material concerns” over failures at the Mumbai-based cooperative bank.The EOW has seized financial records for forensic auditing to determine the full scale of the fraud and identify any additional suspects.","Hitesh Mehta, the former general manager and head of accounts at New India Cooperative Bank, ordered into police custody.

Additionally, the report adds that the credit costs are anticipated to normalise as stress in the unsecured segment stabilises.The third quarter of FY2025 has been challenging for the banking sector due to the higher credit costs, slower loan and deposit growth, and pressure on NIMs.Private banks in the third quarter reported muted earnings growth mainly led by weak operating performance and a steady rise in credit cost, while Public Sector Banks (PSBs) reported healthy earnings growth, led by lower credit costs, offsetting weak operating performance, the report mentions.Higher credit cost was on account of the unsecured segment, while the lower share of unsecured loans for PSU banks supported earnings, according to the report.Net interest income (NII), the difference between a bank's interest income and its interest expenses, saw growth that was weak, driven by lower NIM and moderation in credit growth.PSU banks saw higher pressure on NIM, while private banks reported marginally lower NIMs q-o-q.PSU banks saw better earnings growth than private banks, led by lower credit costs under their coverage, the report added.Most private banks (barring HDFCB and ICICIB) saw a steady rise in credit cost, as asset quality in the unsecured segment (credit cards and MFI) worsened further in Q3FY2025.The unsecured retail segment continues to face elevated delinquencies, impacting earnings and return ratios.However, the report adds that the asset-quality deterioration remains concentrated in mid- and small-sized banks, with the market largely pricing in these concerns.

With the inflation woes taking a backseat for now, the RBI will have more room to focus on growth,"" the Centrum report said.The country was facing high food inflation over the past few months, mainly due to an increase in the inflation of vegetables, fruits, oils and fats. It now seems to have abated. High food prices were a pain point for the policymakers in India, who wished to bring retail inflation to 4 per cent on a sustainable basis.The RBI had kept the repo rate elevated at 6.5 per cent for nearly five years to keep inflation contained. The repo rate is the rate of interest at which the RBI lends to other banks. The RBI has recently reduced the repo rate by 25 basis points to put a thrust on growth and consumption in the economy.""January's CPI breather was primarily on account of softening food prices, i.e. vegetable prices. We expect prices to further cool from here as fresh vegetables and pulses are anticipated to hit the market,"" Centrum added.""We expect inflation to average 4.8 per cent in 2024-25.

His tenure as Chief Minister (2018-2023) was marked by pro-farmer policies, rural development initiatives, and a strong political presence against the BJP. However, Congress lost in the 2023 state elections, and Baghel was replaced by BJP’s Vishnu Deo Sai as chief minister.His elevation to the national level is being seen as part of Congress’s 'Rajasthan Formula,' where senior leaders are being strategically positioned to manage key states.

Reduction of words

New Income Tax Bill 2025: Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman introduced the New Income Tax Bill 2025 in Lok Sabha earlier this week. The New Income Tax Bill is expected to replace the decades old Income Tax Act 1961. It is less complicated and easier for the taxpayer to understand, says the government. The government has released a list of top 30 FAQs that taxpayers may have about the New Income Tax Bill 2025. We take a look:The current Income-tax Act was enacted in 1961 and came into existence with effect from 01.04.1962. It has been amended nearly 65 times with more than 4000 amendments, year on year through Finance Acts, based on the evolving requirements of modifications in taxation Policy.Also Read | New Income Tax Bill 2025: Read full text of proposed new I-T Act Tax administrators, practitioners and taxpayers have acknowledged the contribution ofthe Income-tax Act, 1961 in overall tax governance and economy. However, over the time concerns have also been expressed over the accumulation of amendments, the intricate language, detailed provisions, redundancies and the heavy structure of the Income-tax Act.The Income-tax Act is dynamic legislation requiring regular updating and amendments to reflect the nation’s changing economic, social, and political realities. Criminal and other civil laws do not undergo such frequent updating and amendments whereas the Income-tax Act is regularly updated (on annual basis) to reflect the economic changes, fiscal policies, and government priorities. It, therefore, adapts to changes in the economy, business environments, inflation rates, income sources, and global financial trends. The government has introduced tax reforms to encourage specific sectors of the economy while balancing the same with requirements of revenue collection and widening/deepening of the tax base. Given its direct link to taxation and economic conditions, the Act needs to be more adaptable to reflect shifting economic policies, changing incomes, inflation, and emerging industries. The dynamic nature of the Income-tax Act provides it flexibility to accommodate new economic trends.Examples:i. To promote exports, specific provisions such as 80HH, 80HHC were brought into the statute. The same having served intended purpose have been since omitted or made inapplicable after sun set date.ii. To promote infrastructure development, section 80IA was brought into Income-tax Act, 1961.iii. Sections 80HHE, 10A and 10AA were introduced for facilitating software exports.iv. Section 80IAC is yet another example of encouraging the start-ups.The income tax law has become increasingly bulky over time, with its traditional style of drafting and numerous amendments. The complexity of language in the present Act is a product of different factors. To keep pace with certain legal pronouncements, explanations and provisos were often inserted to clarify legislative intent. Changing taxation priorities also led to introduction of additional text to an otherwise simple provision. Further, certain provisions remained in the statute, despite becoming non-operational, in view of pending claims/issues from earlier years.Attempts have been made in the past, including those in 2009 and 2019 for simplification of the Income tax Act. The recommendations from these efforts, as regards policy, have been considered in the amendments carried out from time to time.Simplification of tax laws has received attention globally. Countries have undertaken similar exercises to enhance clarity and compliance in their taxation laws. In the UK, the process was carried out during the period 1994 to 2010 for simplifying the language. Before simplification, the UK Income and Corporation Tax Act, 1988 comprised 960 pages. However, after simplification, it was divided into five separate Acts, with their page counts increased, resulting in a more segmented but overall larger body of tax law.Also Read | New Income Tax Bill 2025 explained: 10 key takeaways for taxpayers - top points you should know Similarly, Australia underwent a similar process during 1994 to 1997, where simplification of language also resulted in a longer tax code.These international experiences emphasize the delicate balance between simplification and the need for clear, unambiguous legal language. Drawing from these lessons, effort has been made to focus not just on linguistic simplification but also on structural rationalization.The Hon’ble Finance Minister in the budget speech in July 2024 stated that the purpose of the comprehensive review of the Income-tax Act, 1961, is to make the Act “concise, lucid, easy to read and understand”.Following ground rules have been considered for simplifying the existing provisions:i. The Bill proposes to eliminate redundant provisions, reducing its length by nearly half.ii. The drafting style of the new Bill is straightforward and clear, making the provisions easier to understand by incorporating more than 57 tables compared to 18 tables in the Income-tax Act, 1961. Sub-sections and clauses have been used, instead of relying on provisos and explanations for exceptions and carve-outs. This minimises cross references and conflict by aggregating all applicable provisions related to a single scenario in one place.iii. All provisos (about 1200) and explanations (about 900) have been removed.iv. The 1961 Act contains numerous cross-references to sections, sub-sections, clauses, sub-clauses, items, and sub-items, making the provisions challenging to interpret. The new Bill adopts a simplified reference system, allowing provisions to be cited by simply mentioning the section. For instance, section 133 (1)(b)(ii) in the new bill would indicate sub-clause (ii) of clause (b) of sub-section (1) of section 133 in the existing Act. This change makes the Act's language easier to understand.v. A significant aspect of the Bill is the elimination of the concepts of ‘previous year’ and ‘assessment year’. Prior to 1989, the concept of ‘previous year’ and ‘assessment year’ had been brought because the taxpayers could have different twelve-month previous years for each source of income. From 1st April 1989, previous year was aligned to a financial year in all cases. However, ‘assessment year’ continued to be used for various proceedings under the Act. Thus, a taxpayer was required to track two different periods, i.e., the ‘previous year’ as well as the ‘assessment year’. This presented difficulties in complying to the provisions of the Act especially for a new taxpayer who had to keep track of ‘previous year’, ‘assessment year’ as well as ‘financial year’.Also Read | Income Tax Slabs FY 2025-26 explained: 20 FAQs individual taxpayers should check to understand tax rates, income tax benefit under new tax regime A comprehensive consultative process was undertaken for the simplification exercise. A total of 20,976 online suggestions for simplification and removal of redundancies were received, analysed and relevant suggestions were categorized into policy-related, language simplification, removal of redundant or obsolete provisions, etc. Meetings with industry and professional associations were held and field-level brainstorming sessions were held within the Income Tax Department, towards this exercise.At the international level, consultations were held with some of the taxation authorities that had undertaken similar exercise in the recent past, viz. the Australian Tax Office and Treasury, and the UK’s Office of Tax Simplification.The documents prepared in 2009 and 2019, were also referred, while undertaking the exercise. International and national guidance material such as ‘Drafting Guide for Simplification of Laws’ issued by Legislative Department, Ministry of Law and Justice, was studied for simplification of legal language.In addition to the stakeholder exercise mentioned in Q I.9, suggestions were sought from taxpayers, industry and professional associations, and field level officers of the Department. A committee of around 150 officers of the Department was actively involved in the entire exercise. The Committee prepared the draft text of various chapters, which was meticulously vetted by the Legislative Department of Ministry of Law and Justice, and consolidated in the form of the final Bill, after necessary approvals.More than 60,000 man-hours were dedicated by the team for finalising the new Bill.The readability of tax law has been improved by using simpler language, as against traditional legal language. Where multiple situations are covered, the sections have been made enumerative. Wherever feasible, extensive use of table formats has been made. TDS provisions have been presented in a tabular form. Certain provisions such as section 10, which contained about 150 clauses has been placed in Schedules and presented in the form of tables.As a result of the comprehensive exercise, the size of the new Bill has reduced by about half on one hand and one the other, the provisions have been consolidated and presented in a user friendly format.Provisos (more than 1200) and Explanations (more than 900) have been removed, with their simplified content placed as sub-sections or clauses. Wherever feasible, procedural aspects and specific details are proposed to be provided by way of Rules.Yes. Certain provisions became redundant due to numerous amendments and/or policy changes over the years. This resulted in large number of such provisions in the Act. For example, deduction under section 10A, which was a special provision for newly established industrial undertakings in the free trade zones, is no longer available from the Assessment Year 2012-13, onwards. Such obsolete provisions have been removed from the text of the Bill.However, provisions applicable to earlier Assessment Years shall be governed by Repeal and Savings provisions.In addition to removal of ‘provisos’, ‘explanation’ and redundant provisions, formulae, tables, and structures have been used to enhance clarity in the new bill. To the extent possible, provisions involving the same issues, which were present in different chapters in the current Act, have now been consolidated. Redundancy has been removed and definitions at multiple places have been consolidated.In case of provisions relating to Non-Profit organisations (NPOs), the entire text related to NPOs has been consolidated and structured into 7 sub-parts which contain provisions related to Registration, Income, Commercial activities, Compliances, Violations, Registrations for the purposes of eligibility of donations and Interpretations.The new Income-tax Bill is approximately half the length of the existing Income-tax Act 1961, with significant re-organisation of provisions in different sections. While undertaking simplification exercise, a conscious attempt has been made to minimise the scope of litigation and fresh interpretations. For this purpose:a. Key words/phrases, especially where courts have given rulings, have been retained with minimal modifications.b. Language has been simplified by use of short sentences to the extent possible.c. Sections have been translated into row or sub-rows in tables, reducing the number of words and bringing clarity.d. Provisions have been made clear to minimize scope for multiple interpretations. The provisos and explanations have been removed and simplified content has been placed as sub-sections and clauses.e. Provisions related to international taxation have been dealt with, broadly, to ensure tax certainty.f. NGO chapter has been made more comprehensive with use of plain language.g. Exemption sections, for example section 10 in the present Act, has been made simpler through tables and placing large number of provisions in Schedules.h. Formulae and tables have been used to enhance clarity, wherever feasible.i. Provisions involving same issues and definitions, which were present in different chapters in the existing Act have been consolidated, to the extent possible.Also Read | Latest income tax slabs 2025-26: How much tax do individuals earning slightly above Rs 12 lakh have to pay? Marginal relief calculations explained There has been a significant reduction in the text of new Bill, in comparison to the existing Income Tax Act, as summarised below.* Effective SectionsBesides about 1200 Provisos and 900 Explanations have been removed.During the course of numerous amendments to the Income tax Act, 1961, several policy decisions were incorporated as separate provisions. Many a times such provisions were connected to already existing sections and accordingly the new sections were numbered in continuation to the existing sections. For example, several provisions relating to tax on special cases were inserted as sections starting with 115 series viz 115 AC,115AD, 115JB, 115VP etc.As a result of such insertions, effective sections existing in the Income tax Act, 1961 are 819.While the existing Income-tax Act contains 298 numbered sections, effective sections in the current Act are 819. This is because other than numeric section numbers there are large number of sections with alpha-numeric codes such as 115A to 115WM (117 sections) and so on. The Income-tax Act not only deals with levy of tax but it is a comprehensive document, which encompasses all aspects of tax administration. It also includes other aspects such as:(a) laying down the administrative framework, assigning roles and responsibilities for assessing officers, taxpayers, tax deductors, and professionals etc;(b) setting out the framework for income determination, timelines, appellate procedures, enforcement, assessments, and penalties; and(c) taking into account the impact of interpretations on economic policy, affecting both domestic and international investments.The new Bill proposes 536 sections to meet the above-mentioned requirements.Further, several sections in the new Bill exist primarily to honour the commitments under the existing tax regime, including provisions relating to Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT), various deductions and exemptions, etc. These provisions will remain in force until their respective sunset clauses take effect. Therefore, these are required to be part of new Bill to ensure a smooth transition, while maintaining legal and policy continuity.The simplification exercise, inter-alia, encompasses following aspects:i. Redundant provisions of the Income tax Act have been removed;ii. Sub-sections and clauses have been used, instead of relying on provisos and explanations for exceptions and carve-outs;iii. Simplified system for cross referencing of sections, sub-sections, clauses etc has been used;iv. Extensive use of tables, formulae for enhanced clarity;v. Consolidation of provisions scattered across various sections/ Chapters relating to a single issue; etcSince there have been regular amendments to the Income Tax Act, 1961 including amendments proposed in Finance Bill, 2025, the Act stands updated from policy perspective. All amendments proposed upto Finance Bill 2025 have been duly incorporated in the new Income tax bill 2025. Therefore, while no major policy related changes have been made in the Bill, the above aspects have led to proposed ‘material’ changes in the existing law.Section-wise mapping will be made available on the official website of the Income Tax Department.The concept of ‘tax year’ has been introduced replacing ‘previous year’ and ‘assessment year’. The timelines and computation in the Bill are now with reference to the financial year for which the income is liable to be taxed. It is expected that the use of ‘tax year’ will make the new Bill easier to comprehend. Further, many of the comparable tax jurisdictions in the world are using one single term, for purpose of denoting the unit period of taxation. ‘Tax year’ is commonly used in many countries.With the introduction of ‘tax year’, broadly the following principles have been adopted:i. ‘Tax Year’: Unit period of taxation. This term shall be referred in respect of all transactions and income for that period.ii. ‘Financial Year’: For purposes of timelines for compliance and for procedural issues.Also Read | Budget 2025 Income Tax calculator explained: Save up to Rs 1.1 lakh! How income tax slab changes will benefit taxpayers at different salary levels under new regime TDS and TCS provisions have been made easier to comprehend by providing tables. There are separate tables for payment to residents and non-residents, and where no deduction at source is required. For example, the proposed provisions relating to TDS on rent are shown below:(Reference can be made to Table in proposed section 393 of the Bill)The provisions related to Non-Profit Organizations were present at different places in the existing Act, in section 11, section 12, section 12A, section 12AA, section 12AB, section 13, section 115BBC, section 115BBI, section 115TD, section 115TE, section 115TF. The provisions related to approval are under the first and second proviso to section 80G (5). These have been simplified and consolidated into one chapter. All the provisions related to registered Non-Profit Organisations have now been arranged in Part B of Chapter XVII titled “B.–– Special Provisions for Registered Non-Profit Organisation” in the new Bill.All the provisions pertaining to salary have been consolidated at one place for ease of understanding so that the taxpayer does not have to refer to separate chapters for filing his return of income. The deductions which were earlier allowed under section 10 of the Income Tax Act,1961, like gratuity, leave encashment, commutation of pension, compensation on VRS and retrenchment compensation, are now part of the salary chapter itself. Some of the allowances like HRA are now provided in Schedule II of the new Bill that finds reference in the provisions relating to salary. The objective was to improve readability by way of providing tables and formulas.While the chargeability of all the perquisites has been retained in the Act, their valuation, conditions and exceptions have been shifted to Rules as they do not affect every taxpayer. Similarly, redundant and repetitive provisions have also been removed for better readability.Provisions relating to exemptions for specific incomes and persons are being moved to separate schedules for easier reference and simpler compliance as follows:Stage 1: Bill is passed by the Parliament and becomes an ActStage 2: Operational and delegated legislation frameworki. Notification of new Rules and Forms.ii. Simultaneous exercise of software development to set up the systems and processes for various administrative and quasi-judicial functions.Various facets of compliance for the respective years have been mentioned in the Repeals and Savings clause in the Bill, which will safeguard all rights and liabilities accrued under the old law.There are no changes related to rates. Since there have been regular amendments to the Income Tax Act, 1961 including amendments proposed in Finance Bill, 2025, the Act stands updated from policy perspective. All amendments proposed upto Finance Bill 2025 have been duly incorporated in the new Income tax bill 2025. Therefore, while no major policy related changes have been made in the Bill, the above aspects have led to proposed ‘material’ changes in the existing law.The Income Tax Bill 2025 also contains all amendments proposed in Finance Bill 2025. Therefore, the users are advised to compare the provisions of the Income Tax Act, 1961, as updated with proposed amendments in Finance bill 2025, while reading the Income Tax Bill, 2025. There is, therefore, no change in the scope of ‘virtual digital asset’ under the Income Tax Bill, 2025. The definition under the Bill incorporates the amendment already proposed under the Finance Bill, 2025.As noted above, the total words in the new Income Tax Bill, 2025 are around 2.6 lakhs, as against 5.12 lakh words in the Income Tax Act, 1961. Some of the Chapters where substantial reduction of words have been achieved are as given below:","The government has released a list of top 30 FAQs that taxpayers may have about the New Income Tax Bill 2025.

Trump's tariff threats a negotiating tool: Experts,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/trumps-tariff-threats-a-negotiating-tool-experts/articleshow/118263079.cms,"Donald Trump (AP photo)

What are reciprocal tariffs?

Are

Indian tariffs

actually high?

How will reciprocal tariffs work?

So, what next?

What's the implication for the US?

US President Donald Trump has vowed to impose what he calls reciprocal tariffs on countries, such as China, Brazil, France, the European Union, India and others, to ""restore the fairness in US trade relationships and countering non-reciprocal trading arrangements"". The ""Fair and Reciprocal Plan"" ostensibly seeks to ""correct long-standing imbalances"" in global trade and ensure fairness across the board and make US industry competitive.There is nothing like reciprocal tariffs in global trade rules. It's a term coined by US president Donald Trump during his election campaign seeking to hit out at trade partners, such as India, which he asserts have high tariffs on products such as automobiles and alcohol. The idea is to match duties. In simple terms, if Country A sees that Country B places a 20% tariff on goods imported from A, then Country A might decide to match that same 20% tariff on goods it imports from B.A White House Fact Sheet says the average applied US tariff is 5%, compared to 39% in India. It also says that India charges 100% duty on motorcycles compared with 2.4% in the US. The numbers do not factor in the lower tariffs announced for motorcycles in the budget - 40% in completely built form. Besides, Trump is also being selective with facts. Some footwear items attract close to 40% import duty in the US, certain varieties of peanuts are taxed at over 54%, while a few textiles products, such as some of men's and boy's trousers, breeches and shorts face tariffs of 28%. And, the import duty on certain types of tobacco is 350%. While the US cries foul over high duties on alcohol in India, which faces upwards of 100% duty, this is because govt treats it as a sin good, just like tobacco.As for complexity, which India is often criticised for, here is a sample from the US tariff schedule: Certain wrist watches have a specific duty, up to $2.3 each, in addition to 6.25% tariff on the case and strap and 5.3% on the battery. In any case, govt officials and trade experts pointed out that India's duties are in line with commitments undertaken by it at the WTO, which provides developing countries the flexibility to levy higher duties to allow nascent industries to develop. In contrast the caps on tariffs for developed countries are much lower.Trump's statement early Friday only suggests a tit-for-tat action, although it is open to interpretation. The US commerce department will produce the list by April 1. It could mean that the U S authorities prepare item-wise import duty based on what each country levies on American products. The White House Fact Sheet talks about Brazil levying 18% duty on ethanol compared with 2.5% by the US. Or EU imposing 10% duty on imported cars against 2.5% in the US. Some experts also suggested that it could mean product category-wise duties. But all of this is speculation since no details have been spelt out.Trump's statements have in fact added more complexities. He wants to budget for subsidies, other trade barriers and VAT. Now, WTO agreement deals with subsidies separately and is subject to safeguard action. As for VAT, global trade rules allow countries to impose the same level of VAT or GST on a product, that is applicable to a domestically produced item. And, it is over and above customs duty.Most trade experts see Trump's threats as a negotiating tool to get countries on the table. Countries are waiting for more clarity to emerge and some are expecting a trade war with American trade partners responding through other action and challenging the decisions at WTO's dispute settlement body. But successive US presidents, starting with Barack Obama, have made the WTO's dispute mechanism defunct and there is not much hope there.Higher tariffs on imports means that prices in the US will go up, something that Trump admits is a possibility in the short-term. But for the medium-term, he is selling the great American resurgence story, ignoring that wages in the US are so high that it is tough for it to compete with countries where they are lower.","US President Donald Trump has vowed to impose what he calls reciprocal tariffs on countries.

If Country A sees that Country B places a 20% tariff on goods imported from A, then Country A might decide to match that same 20% tariffs on goods it imports from B.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118263096,imgsize-31514,width-400,resizemode-4/118263096.jpg"
Donald Trump’s reciprocal tariffs: What it means for India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/donald-trump-reciprocal-tariffs-india-pm-modi-visit-to-us/articleshow/118238761.cms,"Driving the news

Howard Lutnick, Trump’s nominee for commerce secretary, said that his team is working to finalize the details, with tariffs expected to be ready by April 2.

The measure is likely to reshape America's trade relationships and has already sparked reactions from major economies, including India.

Trump’s move follows his campaign promise to crack down on what he sees as unfair trade practices by other countries. He has long accused nations—including allies like India, Japan, and the European Union—of imposing higher tariffs on American products while benefiting from lower US duties.

Understanding reciprocal tariffs

'Got Trump's Number...': Zelensky's 'Child-Like' Remark On U.S. President's Call Follows Russia Rant

Gone are the days of America being taken advantage of: this plan will put the American worker first, improve our competitiveness in every area of industry, reduce our trade deficit, and bolster our economic and national security. A White House factsheet on Trump's “fair and reciprocal plan” on trade

How would reciprocal tariffs work?

Tariff imbalances: If a country imposes high tariffs on US imports, the US will match those levies on goods from that nation.

Non-tariff barriers: These include government subsidies, stringent regulations that disadvantage foreign companies, VATs, and exchange rate policies that artificially lower the cost of exports.

Sector-Specific Adjustments: Tariffs may apply to individual products, industries, or as an overall rate on imports from a particular country.

For instance, Brazil currently imposes an 18% tariff on US ethanol imports, whereas the US allows Brazilian ethanol in largely duty-free. Under the new policy, Washington could either raise its own tariffs on Brazilian ethanol or pressure Brazil to lower its duties. Similarly, the European Union charges a 10% tariff on vehicle imports compared to the US’s 2.5%, prompting Trump to label the EU’s trade policies as “absolutely brutal.”

Why it matters

The reciprocal tariffs policy is expected to have a widespread impact on global trade, particularly on emerging economies with high tariff rates, such as India. While the intention is to level the playing field, it could also lead to higher inflation in the US and economic slowdowns in affected countries.

For India, which enjoys a trade surplus with the US, the new policy could mean: Higher costs for Indian exporters, particularly in industries like pharmaceuticals, textiles, and information technology, which are heavily reliant on the US market.

Potential retaliatory tariffs from India, leading to a tit-for-tat trade war that could hurt both economies.

Increased pressure on India to lower its trade barriers, which could lead to long-term shifts in economic policy.

Trump’s order also considers non-tariff barriers, such as value-added taxes (VATs), regulatory policies, and currency exchange rates, which could complicate trade negotiations further.

India has been just about the highest tariff nation in the world...hard to sell to India because of very strong tariffs...whatever India charges, we charge them. US President Donald Trump

The big picture

The US-India trade relationship is currently valued at over $190 billion annually, with a $50 billion surplus in India’s favor.

India’s average tariff rate is around 17%, one of the highest among major US trading partners, compared to the US’s 3.3% average rate.

Under the new policy, tariffs could be adjusted country by country and product by product, meaning Indian goods could face increased duties based on existing disparities.

The US government's decision to impose reciprocal tariffs in response to higher duties from its trading partners is unlikely to have a significant impact on India due to differences in their export profiles, according to economic think tank GTRI on Friday.

The Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI) provided an example, stating that if the US imposes a 50 percent reciprocal tariff on Indian pistachios because India does the same, it would have little effect since India does not export pistachios.

Furthermore, GTRI founder Ajay Srivastava noted that for 75 percent of US exports to India, the average tariff remains below 5 percent.

On the other hand, India faces steep US tariffs on many labor-intensive goods such as textiles, garments, and footwear, with rates ranging from 15 to 35 percent on several products, he added.

""Given the differences in the export profiles of the two countries, reciprocal tariffs may not have a significant impact...In the new Trump era, India may wait to see the US decision in April on reciprocal tariffs and then respond in equal measures as we did in June 2019,"" Srivastava said.

The US average applied Most Favored Nation (MFN) tariff on agricultural goods is 5%. But India’s average applied MFN tariff is 39%. India also charges a 100% tariff on US motorcycles, while we only charge a 2.4% tariff on Indian motorcycles. A White House factsheet on Trump's “fair and reciprocal plan” on trade

How it may impact India

1. Indian industries at risk

Pharmaceuticals: India is a leading exporter of generic drugs to the US, and higher tariffs could make Indian medicines less competitive in the American market.

Textiles: The US is one of the largest buyers of Indian textiles and garments. Increased duties could disrupt supply chains and affect Indian manufacturers.

Information technology: India’s IT sector depends on the US for business contracts, and while services are not directly affected by tariffs, trade tensions could spill over into tech policy.

Steel industry: According to a Reuters report, India's smaller steelmakers could be forced out of business by a further surge in imports resulting from sharp tariff increases imposed by Trump, industry executives warned.

""The increased tariffs may divert Chinese and other Asian exports to India while heightening competition, creating a downward pressure on domestic prices, and affecting small Indian producers with low-cost Chinese dumping,"" said Anubhav Kathuria, managing director of stainless steel producer Synergy Steels.

""We need to protect ourselves from other countries diverting steel to India because we do not have any safeguards,"" said one senior steel company executive, who did not wish to be identified because he was not authorised to talk to the media.

2. Trade deficit and tariff battles

Reducing tariffs on Harley-Davidson motorcycles, a longstanding Trump grievance.

Dropping retaliatory tariffs on US almonds, apples, chickpeas, lentils, and walnuts in 2023.

However, these moves may not be enough. Trump’s new policy could force India to make deeper concessions or risk losing access to the US market.

3. Potential retaliation from India

US agricultural products, such as soybeans and corn.

Energy exports, including oil and gas. India is a major buyer of US energy, and trade disputes could disrupt agreements.

Aerospace and defense deals, including purchases of Boeing aircraft and military equipment.

India has historically been cautious about trade wars, preferring to negotiate rather than escalate. However, if Trump's policies disproportionately hurt Indian businesses, pressure could mount on the Modi government to respond.

The leaders welcomed early steps to demonstrate mutual commitment to address bilateral trade barriers. The United States welcomed India’s recent measures to lower tariffs on US products of interest in the areas of bourbon, motorcycles, ICT products and metals, as well as measures to enhance market access for US agricultural products, like alfalfa hay and duck meat, and medical devices. India also expressed appreciation for US measures taken to enhance exports of Indian mangoes and pomegranates to the United States. Both sides also pledged to collaborate to enhance bilateral trade by increasing US exports of industrial goods to India and Indian exports of labor-intensive manufactured products to the United States. The two sides will also work together to increase trade in agricultural goods. India - US joint statement

Between the lines

Trump’s tariff move is as much about domestic politics as it is about trade. By pushing for tougher tariffs, he appeals to American manufacturing and agriculture sectors, which he sees as crucial for his re-election strategy.

India’s global trade strategy could shift as a result. With growing ties to the European Union, Middle East, and Southeast Asia, New Delhi may seek new trade agreements to offset US pressure.

The China factor: Trump’s tariffs have historically focused on China, but expanding them to other countries signals a broader protectionist agenda. India must navigate this carefully, balancing its own trade policies while maintaining strong US ties.

What’s next?

Trump’s tariff strategy could go in several directions:

Negotiation and compromise: India and the US could engage in talks to lower tariffs on both sides, preventing a full-scale trade war.

Gradual escalation: If the US raises duties, India might respond selectively, targeting politically sensitive sectors to push for a better deal.

Broader trade realignment: If tensions persist, India could explore alternative markets to reduce reliance on US trade.

India’s diplomatic approach will be key—whether it chooses to push back, negotiate, or make strategic concessions.

President Donald Trump signed an order on February 13 directing his administration to propose “reciprocal tariffs” on US trading partners, a move that could significantly impact global trade. The tariffs, expected by April, aim to match or offset tariffs and other trade barriers imposed on US goods by foreign nations.In trade terminology, “reciprocal” tariffs typically refer to policies ensuring that countries impose similar levies on each other’s goods, aiming for fairness in trade relations. Historically, reciprocity in trade often meant the mutual reduction of trade barriers to facilitate economic growth and global integration. The US Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act of 1934, for instance, marked a shift away from American protectionism, enabling the US and its trading partners to negotiate lower tariffs on each other’s products.However, the Trump administration sees the current global trade landscape differently. It argues that many US trading partners have maintained policies that disadvantage American businesses, whether through high tariffs, non-tariff barriers, or other regulatory practices. The administration asserts that these policies unfairly benefit foreign exporters while putting American manufacturers at a disadvantage.During Trump’s first term, commerce secretary Wilbur Ross floated the idea of raising US tariffs to match those of its trading partners. Under this “ideal” trade system, the US would lower its tariffs only if other nations did the same. The newly proposed reciprocal tariffs are expected to operate along these lines but with a broader scope, factoring in non-tariff barriers such as value-added taxes (VATs), exchange rate manipulations, and industrial subsidies.Unlike the blanket tariffs Trump previously considered, reciprocal tariffs would be tailored on a country-by-country basis. According to a White House memo distributed to trade officials, the policy will account for several elements beyond simple tariff comparisons. It aims to counterbalance:The impact of Trump’s reciprocal tariffs on India will be determined by how far the US goes in adjusting duties and how India responds.India has a trade surplus of around $50 billion with the US, meaning it exports more to America than it imports. Trump has repeatedly criticized this imbalance, arguing that it reflects unfair trade practices.India has already taken steps to ease tensions, such as:If the US imposes higher duties on Indian goods, India could retaliate with counter-tariffs on American exports. This could affect:(With inputs from agencies)","The measure is likely to reshape America's trade relationships and has already sparked reactions from major economies, including India. Trump’s move follows his campaign promise to crack down on what he sees as unfair trade practices by other countries. While the intention is to level the playing field, it could also lead to higher inflation in the US and economic slowdowns in affected countries.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118254628,imgsize-51032,width-400,resizemode-4/118254628.jpg"

Bitcoin bull mania has gripped the crypto market once again. This time, in a meme coin format. Bitcoin Bull ($BTCBULL) just broke the $1 million milestone in its presale.The community-driven token is on a mission to give investors exposure to the BTC bull mania, which is hyped to touch $1 million and beyond. Whenever Bitcoin hits a major price milestone, $BTCBULL holders receive Bitcoin as a reward.BTC is one of the world’s most successful assets. It has registered an AAR (Average Annual Return) of 230%. For better context, the token has seen its value rise over 200 million percent since its beginning. However, most of the market missed out on BTC’s massive explosion over the years. $BTCBULL is here to alleviate the regret. With BTC expected to grow and expand further, from $100,000 to $250,000 and beyond $1 million, investors are optimistic. Increased media coverage, widespread adoption, and potential use in national reserves have strengthened the bullish narratives.With $BTCBULL, investors can join the Bitcoin movement at an affordable price. The platform hosts $BTCBULL and $BTC airdrops that coincide with the key price milestones of Bitcoin.True, BTC has experienced multifold growth over the years and most investors can’t afford to pay $100,000 to buy a Bitcoin. But $BTCBULL gives the community exposure to BTC’s growth at small costs.$BTCBULL has a total supply of 21 billion tokens, while BTC has a total supply of 21 million. $BTCBULL has implemented a built-in deflationary model to bring more scarcity into the tokenomics over time.The burning mechanism is designed to drive the value of the token by taking advantage of the inverse relationship between price and supply. It rewards long-term $BTCBULL investors by creating upward price pressure through increased demand.Exciting $BTCBULL airdrops or burns are activated every time $BTC hits a new price milestone.

TikTok returns to Apple and Google app stores in US after Trump delays ban,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/tiktok-returns-to-apple-and-google-app-stores-in-us-after-trump-delays-ban/articleshow/118232709.cms,"TikTok is back on Apple and Google app stores in the United States after President Donald Trump delayed enforcing a ban on the short-form video platform for 75 days.The Chinese-owned social media platform was reinstated on Thursday evening, weeks after being removed in compliance with a newly enacted law prohibiting its operation in the country.Trump attempted to delay enforcement of the TikTok ban through an executive order, but companies hesitated to restore the app until they were certain it would not violate the law.The legislation, passed last year, mandated that ByteDance , TikTok's Chinese parent company, divest ownership to a non-Chinese entity by January 19. It also imposed significant financial penalties on app store operators and internet hosting providers that continued to distribute or support TikTok.According to The New York Times, TikTok executives expressed optimism during a briefing call on Tuesday that Apple and Google would soon reinstate the app. H. Lee Justine, a TikTok creator and author who participated in the call, confirmed the statement.""They said that the administration had given them a lot of information that they wouldn't be penalized and that they were really hopeful that any day now they would put it back in the app stores,"" she said in an interview.""It makes me very hopeful that they felt that they could do this because hopefully this means that long term there's not going to be issues and this will work out,"" she added.Despite Apple and Google preventing new TikTok downloads, previously installed versions continued functioning normally on American devices.TikTok's reinstatement on app stores is a promising development, granting the company until early April to secure a buyer. This marks a dramatic turnaround—just a month ago, it faced a ban with strong bipartisan support in Congress. The law had even received unanimous approval from the Supreme Court before being overturned by Trump.","TikTok is back on Apple and Google app stores in the United States after President Donald Trump delayed enforcing a ban on the short-form video platform for 75 days.

The media and technology company sued Ross Intelligence—a now-defunct legal research firm—in 2020, alleging that it unlawfully used content from its legal platform, Westlaw, to train an AI model without authorisation.Judge Stephanos Bibas of the 3rd US Circuit Court of Appeals ruled a decision on Tuesday that Ross Intelligence was not entitled to use Thomson Reuters' content under US copyright law to develop a competing platform.According to the Associated Press, Bibas, in the summary judgment, concluded that ""none of Ross's possible defenses holds water"" and ruled in Reuters' favour regarding the ""fair use"" matter.Under US law, the ""fair use"" doctrine permits limited use of copyrighted materials for purposes such as teaching, research, or creating a transformative work.In an email to WIRED, Reuters' representative Jeffrey McCoy expressed satisfaction with the verdict, stating that: “We are pleased that the court granted summary judgment in our favor and concluded that Westlaw’s editorial content created and maintained by our attorney editors, is protected by copyright and cannot be used without our consent,” he wrote. “The copying of our content was not ‘fair use.’”Reuters' victory emerges amidst an increasing number of legal challenges initiated by creators, artists and music companies against AI system developers over comparable concerns.The common thread in these legal disputes is the allegation that technology firms utilised vast collections of human-authored content to train their AI systems for generating text that mimics human writing, without seeking authorisation or offering payment to the original content creators.OpenAI and its commercial partner Microsoft are facing copyright infringement lawsuits from renowned authors, including John Grisham, Jodi Picoult, and ""Game of Thrones"" creator George R.R.

US inflation picked up broadly at the start of the year, further undercutting chances of multiple Federal Reserve interest-rate cuts this year at the same time the Trump administration presses forward with tariffs. The monthly consumer price index rose in January by the most since August 2023, led by a range of household expenses like groceries and gas, as well as housing costs. Excluding often-volatile food and energy costs, the so-called core CPI climbed 0.4%, more than forecast, fueled by car insurance, airfares and a record monthly increase in the cost of prescription drugs.Inflation tends to come in higher in January, because many companies choose the start of the year to hike prices and fees. That pattern has been been exacerbated in the post-pandemic era, and several forecasters suggested that the jump in price growth last month won't be repeated going forward.Still, Wednesday's report serves as further evidence that inflation progress has at least stalled - if not in danger of being reversed. Combined with a solid labour market, it will likely keep the Fed on hold for the foreseeable future.","Consumer price index rose in January by the most since August 2023.

Fed in no hurry for rate cuts: Jerome Powell hints no change in US central bank's policy stance,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/fed-in-no-hurry-for-rate-cuts-jerome-powell-hints-no-change-in-us-central-banks-policy-stance/articleshow/118153596.cms,"Future of interest rate cuts remains uncertain

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell announced that the US central bank will be keeping its interest rates unchanged for now, citing inflation levels which fall above Fed’s 2 per cent target and a solid job market.Speaking before the Senate Banking Committee on the first of a two-day testimony, Powell hinted that the central bank would maintain its current policy stance, having already cut rates by a full percentage point in late 2024.“With the economy remaining strong, we do not need to be in a hurry to adjust our policy stance,” he said.His comments come at a time when the Trump administration is introducing sweeping policy changes, including tariffs on steel and aluminium and significant reductions in government spending.The Fed is also conducting a second review of its policy strategies and communication tools, though Powell insisted this would not include changing the bank’s inflation target , despite calls from some economists to raise it.After the Fed’s last review in 2019, it shifted to an average inflation target of 2 per cent, which analysts argue resulted in its slow response to rising prices in 2021 and 2022. The central bank only began raising rates in March 2022 to curb inflation by making borrowing more expensive.At its December meeting, the Fed projected two rate cuts in 2025, thought the market analysts are now less confident. Morgan Stanley revised their forecast to just one rate cut next year, while futures markets suggested a single cut in July.Fewer reductions would mean continued high borrowing costs for mortgages, credit cards, and auto loans, though mortgage rates are also influenced by movements in US Treasury yields.Fed Governor Adriana Kugler had earlier said that the labour market was “stable,” allowing policymakers more time to assess their next move.She also acknowledged that Trump’s proposed economic policies, including tariffs and immigration restrictions, could result in new inflationary pressures. Some economists warn of mass deportations that could shrink the labour force and drive wages higher, fuelling inflation.Others argue that Trump’s deregulation agenda might boost supply and lower prices.“The cautious and the prudent step is to hold the (Fed's key) rate where it is for some time,” Kugler said.Strong job growth suggested less urgency for the Fed to cut rates, a stark contrast to last September, when weak hiring prompted a steep half-point rate reduction amid recession fears.“The latest data bolsters our confidence that the Fed cutting cycle is over,” economists at Bank of America wrote in a note on Friday.","Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell announced that the US central bank will be keeping its interest rates unchanged.

Profits came out to $20 billion while earnings per share reached $1.86, higher than the $1.49 that analysts surveyed by FactSet had anticipated.But the company said it expected revenue for the current quarter to be between $151 billion and 155.5 billion, lower than the $158.56 billion that analysts were expecting. The guidance anticipates ""an unusually large, unfavorable impact"" from foreign exchange rates, it said.Amazon is the biggest online shopping destination in the U.S. and has long been a beneficiary of consumer spending during the holidays. As it has done in recent years, the company in October began offering promotions intended to lure early holiday shoppers. It advertised other discounts during the three-month period, including on major sales days such as Black Friday and Cyber Monday.Amazon on Thursday reported it saw $75.5 billion in revenue for its online shopping business, up 7% from the same period in 2023.Across the retail industry, holiday sales in November and December were better than expected compared with the previous year as lower inflation on holiday goods enticed shoppers to buy, according to The National Retail Federation. Online shopping also saw record sales levels, Adobe Analytics reported in January.Sales for Amazon Web services, the company's prominent cloud computing unit, rose 19% during the fourth quarter. But it fell slightly below analysts expectations.Amazon is one of the biggest players in the competitive tech race around generative artificial intelligence. Like other tech companies, it has ramped up investments in the technology and is spending billions to expand data centers that support AI and cloud computing. The company is also spending money on other equipment, including its own computer chips and those developed by Nvidia. It has also rolled out its own AI models and integrated the generative AI into other parts of its business.In the fourth quarter, Amazon reported spending $27.8 billion on property and equipment, significantly higher than the same period in 2023. Most of the spending was geared towards AI and AWS, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said during a call with analysts on Thursday.""We think virtually every application that we know of today is going to be re-invented with AI inside of it,"" Jassy said. ""I think both our business, our customers and shareholders will be happy medium-to-long term that we're pursuing the capital opportunity and the business opportunity in AI.""Jassy also said during the call that Amazon, like many others, was ""impressed"" by DeepSeek, the Chinese artificial intelligence company whose chatbot recently became the most downloaded app in the U.S.Amazon's quarterly report also comes as the retail industry is absorbing a new 10% tariff President Donald Trump imposed on Chinese imports on Tuesday. Tariffs on Canada and Mexico have been put on hold for about a month.Trump also thew out a trade exemption that allowed low-value shipments from China to bypass duties, a loophole that had given an advantage to China-founded e-commerce firms, such as Shein and Temu.The new tariffs could benefit Amazon by increasing costs for its competitors. But it would also impact Chinese sellers who connect with American consumers on the company's shopping platform. Furthermore, it could raise prices on a recently-launched online storefront that Amazon set up to ship low-cost products directly from China. The storefront, called Amazon Haul, was Amazon's answer to Shein and Temu.Additionally, analysts from Morgan Stanley wrote in a Monday note that Amazon's first-party retail business, though which the company sells products purchased from manufacturers, has the highest exposure to the tariffs. The analysts estimate 25% of the merchandise sold through that business comes from China.","Amazon reported better-than-expected revenue and profits for the holiday shopping period.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume.While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor ( CEA ) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September.
